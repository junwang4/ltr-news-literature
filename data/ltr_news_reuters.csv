2pKZdnW,2017-05-01,Criminal laws fail to deter transmission of AIDS virus," More than 30 years since the first criminal laws were enacted in the United States to try to prevent the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a new study suggests that the regulations have failed to slow transmission of the deadly virus.   The laws impose criminal penalties on people who know they have HIV and engage in behaviors such as sexual activity or needle sharing that might transmit the virus to others, without disclosing their infection status.   “There has been much discussion about whether criminal-exposure laws affect HIV-risk behaviors or transmission,” senior author Dr. Jonathan Mermin said in an email. “In this analysis, we found no association between HIV diagnosis rates and laws that criminalize HIV exposure.”   Working with data collected in 33 states from 2001-2010, Mermin and colleagues at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta tracked diagnoses of HIV, the virus that causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). They also analyzed AIDS diagnosis rates in all 50 states from 1994-2010.    By the end of 2010, 30 states had passed criminal-exposure laws. But the new study, published in the journal AIDS, found no association between criminal-exposure laws and HIV or AIDS diagnosis rates.   The researchers did find two factors associated with higher HIV and AIDS diagnosis rates: lack of education and living in urban areas.   Ayako Miyashita, director of the Los Angeles HIV Law and Policy Project at the UCLA School of Law, said the study “underscores the fact that we understand the social and structural drivers of the epidemic, and that criminalization is not a particularly useful tool in addressing HIV transmission.”   “These laws are harmful,” said Miyashita, who was not involved with the study, in an email. “They embody the continued fear and stigma associated with HIV and serve to perpetuate a lack of awareness and understanding about existing biomedical interventions.”   More than 1.2 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with HIV, according to the CDC. About a third of them take antiretroviral therapy, which can virtually eliminate the possibility of transmitting the virus to others.    Few HIV criminalization laws consider whether an HIV-positive person took measures to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus, the authors write.    A 2013 report in ProPublica pointed out that people have been prosecuted for nondisclosure of HIV infection even when they were using condoms or taking antiviral drugs that made transmission very unlikely ( bit.ly/1ZBdlfN ).   HIV criminal-exposure laws have engendered debate about their effectiveness since 1986, when states first enacted them, the authors write. The laws were intended to encourage people who tested positive for HIV to disclose the fact to potential sex partners and to discourage behaviors that could expose others.    Some feared the laws could have the reverse effect and increase transmission by discouraging testing; if people don’t know they have the virus, they can’t be prosecuted under these laws.    Since 2010, an estimated 40,000 people a year in the U.S. have been diagnosed with HIV.    HIV disproportionately infects blacks, African-Americans, gay Hispanics and Hispanics who inject drugs, previous studies have shown. The new analysis too found that minority populations had higher HIV and AIDS diagnosis rates.    Amira Hasenbush, who has studied HIV criminalization laws in California, said in an email that her research has shown that the laws disproportionately target women and people of color. Hasenbush, a fellow at The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, was not involved with the new study.   “Enforcement data show that HIV criminalization is yet another example of the criminalization of the poor, criminalization of people of color and criminalization of otherwise marginalized populations,” Miyashita said. “We know HIV impacts these communities greatly, and it’s time we realize criminalization is not the solution to addressing the epidemic.”   Miyashita called for review, if not repeal, of all HIV criminalization laws.    “Criminalization is not the solution to this problem,” she said. “These data prove that.”  "
2qlUnlb,2017-05-01,Many U.S. babies and toddlers still don’t have a balanced diet," (Reuters Health) - Despite some recent improvements in how U.S. parents feed young children, more than half of babies aren’t getting any breast milk and many toddlers don’t eat enough fruits and veggies, a new study suggests.   About two in five infants consume breast milk, which doctors recommend for the health of mothers and babies alike. That statistic didn’t change much over the study period from 2005 to 2012.  But more parents stopped giving infants solid foods before six months of age, a practice doctors discourage because solids are harder to swallow and can be less nutritious and higher in calories than breast milk or infant formula.    At least nine in 10 toddlers consume at least a little bit of either fruit or veggies on a typical day, and this didn’t change much during the study period, researchers report in Pediatrics. But the most common veggie was potatoes, and the least popular option was dark green vegetables.    “We knew from previous studies that more work was needed to improve feeding habits in this age group, and we observed many of the same trends in our study: a substantial proportion of American infants are not breastfed, vegetable consumption is lower than desired, and consumption of sweetened beverages and sugary snacks is prevalent,” said study co-author Gandarvaka Miles, a public health researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.    “However, we did observe some trends in the right direction,” Miles added by email.   Pediatricians recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed infants until at least six months of age because it can reduce babies’ risk of ear and respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, allergies, childhood obesity and diabetes.   Mothers can benefit too, with longer periods of breastfeeding linked to lower risks of depression, bone deterioration and certain cancers.   From 2005 to 2008 and again from 2009 to 2012, researchers surveyed parents about infant and toddler eating habits. For the new study, they compared data collected from a total of 2,359 participants.    The proportion of babies under six months of age who were breastfed, exclusively or not, was little changed during this time and was about 36 percent by the end of the study period.    In this age group, however, there was a meaningful reduction in use of infant cereals and fruit juices for babies, which were being fed to 26 percent and 7 percent, respectively, by the end of the study. Pediatricians recommend delaying fruit juice until after age one.    With the older children in the study, researchers found toddlers were more likely to consume fried white potatoes than green vegetables. Consumption of green veggies fell by half during the study to only about 8 percent of toddlers by the end.    “The rates for vegetable consumption are disappointing, as most parents will know that vegetables are healthy but this isn’t translating into consumption rates in their children,” Dr. Helen Coulthard of De Montfort University in the UK, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    One limitation of the study is that parents’ ability to accurately recall and report on how they fed their children during infancy and early childhood isn’t always reliable, the authors note. Researchers also didn’t account for portion sizes.    Still, the findings suggest that parents who struggle to feed their kids the way doctors recommend may be in good company, said Dr. Myles Faith, a researcher at the University at Buffalo who wasn’t involved in the study.    One of the best ways to get kids to try more foods is to stick with it, and keep putting different things in front of them to taste, Faith said by email.    “Repeated exposure to foods increases children’s preferences and intake,” Faith added. “So, the more opportunities infants and children have to see, taste, and experience fruits and vegetables, the more receptive they should become over time.”   These efforts matter because they can influence children’s eating habits and health later in life, said Dr. Elise Mok of the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Center in Canada.    “Early diet has been associated with weight status during childhood and cardiometabolic health in adulthood,” Mok, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

2oH8XyC,2017-04-28,"Malaria, wiped out in U.S., still plagues American travelers"," (Reuters Health) - U.S. public health officials declared victory over malaria in 1951, but the mosquito-borne disease continues to infect and kill American travelers, a new study shows.                     An Anopheles stephensi mosquito obtains a blood meal from a human host through its pointed proboscis in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters November 23, 2015.  REUTERS/Jim Gathany/CDC/Handout via Reuters        From 2000 through 2014, more than 22,000 people with malaria were hospitalized in the U.S., including 182 who died from it, according to estimates published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.   Using hospitalization data, researchers found an average of more than 2,100 U.S. malaria cases a year – nearly double the number previously reported.   Most of those hospitalized for malaria in the U.S. are men. A majority are black, most likely foreign-born individuals who traveled abroad, frequently to their countries of origin, where they often fail to realize they are no longer immune to the deadly parasitic disease, lead author Diana Khuu said in a phone interview.   “We need to encourage travelers to seek pre-travel advice and to use personal protective measures against mosquitoes and anti-malarial medications when they travel to malarious countries,” said Khuu, an epidemiologist at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health.   “Because a lot of people are not using these preventive measures, it’s resulting in a lot of hospitalizations and in half a billion dollars in hospital charges from 2000 to 2014,” she said.    Insecticide-treated bed nets have been credited with spurring a 41 percent drop in worldwide malaria incidence and a 62 percent drop in worldwide malaria deaths over the past 15 years.    Despite the progress, malaria infected an estimated 212 million people and killed an estimated 429,000 in 2015. Nearly 90 percent of cases were in children under age 5 in Africa, where malaria claims a child’s life every two minutes, according to a statement from the National Institutes of Health this week on World Malaria Day, April 25.   Meanwhile, the number of imported malaria cases has steadily increased in the U.S.    Dr. Stephen Gluckman of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia sees six to 10 patients a week who travel to malaria-risk areas in Africa, India, Southeast Asia and parts of South America.   He attributes the increase in U.S. malaria cases to an increase in Americans traveling to developing parts of the world where the disease continues to threaten lives.   He advises people traveling outside the U.S. to consult a “bona fide” travel clinic before departing. “There are several options and significant nuances in advice for preventing malaria,” he said in an email.    Checking the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for travelers ( bit.ly/2k74gQd ) also can be helpful, but Gluckman, who was not involved with the study, believes individualized advice is superior.   He warned that people infected with malaria might carry the disease for months or years before falling ill. In the meantime, an infected pregnant woman could pass malaria to her unborn child, and a mosquito could bite an unsuspecting infected person and pass malaria on when it bites another person.   Moreover, Gluckman warned, there is “a very large group of at-risk people who rarely get screened.”    “These people grew up in developing parts of the world but now live in the U.S.,” he said. “When returning to visit their country of origin, they very rarely seek any prevention advice because they grew up in a community that did not have access to prevention.”   “They are difficult to reach but clearly could be accessed by the proper public health programs in the communities where they live in the U.S.A.,” he said.   People who grew up in malaria-endemic areas, especially those who were exposed as children, do gain some natural protection, but they still can get malaria and therefore need to take preventive steps. In addition, spending long periods in a malaria-free area, like the U.S., can reduce immunity and render people more susceptible to infection.    “You can develop immunity,” Khuu said. “But after you move away, that immunity wanes. If they go back to visit, they might not use the preventive measures because they might think they’re still immune.”   And why do men appear to be more vulnerable, comprising 60 percent of the U.S. cases? Khuu believes they are less likely to seek pre-travel advice, less likely to use mosquito repellent and take anti-malarial medication, and their sweat might be more attractive to mosquitoes.  "
2pn7q2A,2017-04-28,Rethink emphasis on lowering saturated fat to save hearts: docs," (Reuters Health) - Instead of eating less saturated fat and worrying about so-called bad cholesterol, a group of doctors suggests an alternative approach for preventing heart disease.   More important, they say, is to focus on decreasing insulin resistance and inflammation in the body by targeting diet, exercise and reducing stress.   “If we target all those three things together (plus) a reduction of smoking then we’ll combat 80 percent of all heart disease,” said Dr. Aseem Malhotra of Lister Hospital in Stevenage, UK, who coauthored an editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.   Saturated fats are mostly found in animal products like beef, pork, butter, cheese and other dairy.   Blaming coronary artery disease on saturated fat that clogs arteries is “just plain wrong,” according to Malhotra and his two coauthors, Dr. Rita Redberg of the University of California, San Francisco and Dr. Pascal Meier of University College London, UK.   In their editorial, the three experts cite a 2015 review of past research that found no link between a diet full of saturated fats and an increased risk of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke due to clogged arteries, death from coronary heart disease, or death from any cause.   Furthermore, Malhotra told Reuters Health, the traditional advice to reduce levels of “bad” low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol through diet and exercise “is flawed.”   He and his colleagues point to studies in which people who replaced saturated fat with vegetable oils containing omega-6 fatty acids did lower their LDL and total cholesterol levels but still ended up with a higher rate of death.   They also cite the well-known PREDIMED trial, in which people eating a Mediterranean diet with fats from olive oil or nuts were at lower risk of heart problems than people following a low-fat diet.    Another trial found better outcomes in people following a Mediterranean diet than in people eating a typical French diet, despite similar LDL levels in both groups.       The best way to predict heart disease risk, they write, is to look at patients’ ratio of total cholesterol to “good” high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. A high ratio is linked with insulin resistance, which leads to high blood sugar and higher risks for heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity.   Malhotra said insulin resistance is worsened when low-fat dieting leads people to eat more refined carbohydrates like white bread and white rice, which are not found in Mediterranean diets.   He and his colleagues say Mediterranean diets, exercise and reducing stress all help combat inflammation.   “I think the best way to reduce risk of heart disease and stay healthy is to concentrate on a heart-healthy Mediterranean style diet, regular physical activity and not smoking,” Redberg told Reuters Health by email.   Dr. Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, agrees with the experts’ inflammation theory but isn’t ready to remove the emphasis on LDL cholesterol.    Kopecky told Reuters Health that LDL levels are still an important measure to watch and treat with medications.   Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston, also says LDL levels are still important.   “I think the message is correct that we need more focus on diet and reducing inflammation,” Mozaffarian told Reuters Health. “It doesn’t mean we should throw out an additional tool focusing on LDL cholesterol and treatment.”    Prevention doesn’t involve a choice between lifestyle changes or lowering cholesterol, Mozaffarian added.    “It’s both,” he said.  "
2pq43YX,2017-04-28,Is active surveillance safe for men with family history of prostate cancer?," (Reuters Health) - Having a family history of prostate cancer doesn’t make it more risky for men with a new diagnosis of the disease to initially hold off on active treatment in favor of monitoring with periodic lab tests, a research review suggests.    It’s becoming more common for doctors to skip aggressive treatments like surgery or radiation for men with low-risk prostate tumors in favor of doing periodic tests to see if tumors grow, a practice known as active surveillance. But research to date has offered a mixed verdict on whether this approach is safe for certain men with a higher risk, including black patients and people with a family history of prostate tumors.    For the current study, researchers analyzed data from six previously published studies and found that active surveillance wasn’t linked with an increased risk of prostate cancer progressing for men with a family history. One study did, however, find that family history increased the risk of cancer progression in black men.   “The current findings can help doctors reassure patients that having a family history of prostate cancer should not automatically exclude them from being considered for active surveillance, although more research needs to be done for African American men,” said senior study author Dr. James Dupree, a urology researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.    Most men with prostate cancer are diagnosed with low-risk tumors that haven’t spread to other parts of the body. Often, doctors and patients struggle to choose the best course of action because it’s hard to tell which tumors will grow fast enough to be life-threatening and which ones might never get big enough to cause problems.   “Just because a cancer is found, it does not automatically mean it needs to get treated right away,” Dupree said by email. “In some cases, cancer should be treated, but in other cases it may not need immediate treatment and can be managed with active surveillance.”   For example, Dupree and colleagues reviewed one study of 200 patients that didn’t detect a meaningful difference in high-risk tumors based on whether or not men had a family history. In men who did have a family history, this study also didn’t find a difference in risk based on the number of relatives with prostate cancer.    Two other studies in the review looked at biomarkers for prostate tumors, including results from prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests that are commonly used to look for these malignancies. Neither study found family history to be a meaningful predictor of aggressive prostate cancer.    In another study, family history wasn’t a good predictor of aggressive tumors for most men, but it did signal an increased risk for black men.    One limitation of the research review is that it included only six studies, the authors note in BJU International.    Still, the findings should reassure men with a family history of prostate cancer that active surveillance may be a reasonable option in some cases, said Dr. Behfar Ehdaie, a urologic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Screening for prostate cancer saves lives,” Ehdaie said by email. “However, the decisions after prostate cancer is detected may lead to overtreatment.”   To strike the right balance, doctors can screen men at a young age with a PSA blood test to help determine a patient’s future risk, then recommend an appropriate treatment after a man is diagnosed with prostate cancer, Ehdaie added.    “Incorporating active surveillance to treat men with low risk prostate cancer reduces the harms of overtreatment associated with both surgery and radiation therapy,” Ehdaie said.

2pqBoEQ,2017-04-27,Can puppies protect babies from allergies and obesity?," Reuters Health) - Exposing babies to puppies and other furry pets might help them accumulate two types of bacteria in their gut that are associated with a lower risk of allergies and obesity, a Canadian study suggests.    When researchers analyzed fecal samples from 746 babies, they found having dogs and cats in the home during pregnancy and early infancy was associated with higher levels of two gut microbes: Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been linked with lower odds of allergies and obesity, respectively.   “The concept of a `dog intervention’ during pregnancy as a preventive measure for allergies and obesity is not too far-fetched but definitive studies are required to provide evidence for this health benefit,” said senior study author Anita Kozyrskyj, a pediatrics researcher at the University of Alberta.    While the study doesn’t prove pets directly prevent allergies or obesity or demonstrate how cats and dogs cause changes in gut bacteria, it’s possible that pet exposure during pregnancy may influence the composition of gut microbes in the infant by affecting the mother’s vaginal or skin microbes, Kozyrskyj said by email.    Changes in the mother’s microbes might be passed on during birth, even with a surgical delivery, Kozyrskyj added. After that, pets might directly transfer beneficial microbes when they touch babies, and infants may also pick up pet microbes that are left on household surfaces or in dust.    About 45 percent of the households in the study didn’t have any pets, and another 8 percent only had animals during pregnancy, researchers report in the journal Microbiome.    Among the homes with pets both during pregnancy and afterwards, 44 percent had only dogs, 34 percent had just cats and 20 percent had at least one of each.    Regardless of the way babies were delivered, they were more than twice as likely to have high levels of Ruminococcus and Oscillospira when they were exposed to furry creatures while in the womb or during infancy.    Among vaginally delivered babies whose mothers got antibiotics to prevent group B Streptococcus transmission during birth, infants exposed to pets in utero or after delivery had lower levels of Streptococcaceae bacteria in their feces. This family of bacteria can cause pneumonia in infants.    Pet exposure was also linked to lower fecal levels of Enterobacteria even among babies born by emergency cesarean who normally have high levels of these microbes at three months of age. These bacteria are associated with Salmonella and other infections.    The study isn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that pets prevent diseases, the authors note.    Still, the findings add to growing evidence linking exposure to household pets and farm animals with a lower risk of health problems like asthma and allergies, said Tove Fall, a researcher at Uppsala University in Sweden who wasn’t involved in the study.    “This study shows that some bacteria are more common in the gut flora of children born in homes with pets - these findings need to be replicated in other studies,” Fall said by email. “It is not known how these bacteria affect the child health, but in general a higher diversity and richness of the gut flora is thought to help to protect the child from diseases linked to the immune system.”  "
2ox3zmk,2017-04-27,Going to college may increase risk of marijuana use," (Reuters Health) - College is increasingly a gateway for young adults in the U.S. to begin using marijuana and the risk keeps growing the more “normalized” pot use becomes, researchers say.   “We have been expecting marijuana use to increase among young adults,” lead author Richard Miech told Reuters Health in an email.   Young adults today as compared to those of the past are less likely to hold the belief that occasional marijuana use will negatively affect their health, said Miech, a researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.   “We’ve seen again and again that when this belief trends down then marijuana use increases (e.g. in the early 1990s), and, conversely, that when this belief trends up then marijuana use declines (e.g. in the mid-1980s),” he told Reuters Health by email.   Miech and his colleagues think the recent string of U.S. states having legalized recreational use of marijuana accounts in part for the declining proportion of young adults who believe that occasional marijuana use is harmful to health.     “It is likely that at least some young adults interpret this wave of legalization as a signal that marijuana use is safe and state-sanctioned,” he said.   To see how that is affecting recreational use among young people, the study team analyzed data from annual surveys of more than 50,000 adults and adolescents. The surveys have been ongoing since 1975, and are funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Miech said.   They focused on participants who were 19 to 22 years old between 1977 and 2015 and had never used marijuana before their senior year in high school. That was around 64 percent of participants.   About 9 percent of 19-year-olds and 15 percent of 22-year-olds not in college started using marijuana after high school and those percentages remained stable through the entire study period, the researchers report in American Journal of Public Health.   Among college students, the proportion that started using marijuana ranged from 13 percent to 17 percent between 1977 and 2012, then those numbers crept up to between 18 percent and 21 percent from 2013 to 2015.    “We found that marijuana initiation did increase among young adults age 19-22 since 2013, but only among those in college. There was no change in levels of marijuana initiation among 19-22 year-olds who were not in college,” Miech said.   The college environment appears to promote substance use, perhaps in part because of the lack of parental supervision, lots of free time and a party culture, Miech said.   “For what it’s worth, higher levels of substance use in college is also seen with binge drinking (5+ drinks in one sitting): youth age 19-22 are much more likely to binge drink if they are in college as compared to their age peers who are not in college,” Miech said.    Parents should know the majority of young adults who attend college do not initiate marijuana use, Miech added, but the number is increasing.     “There are many reasons why college students might try or use marijuana,” said Christine Lee, director of the Center for the Study of Health and Risk Behaviors at the University of Washington in Seattle, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “We surveyed incoming first-year college students on why they tried or use marijuana . . . . For some, experimentation was a motivator. Young adults might just want to try it and see what it is about. For others, they might use marijuana for reasons such as for social bonding, relaxation, boredom, to fit in, or to enjoy the feeling,” Lee said by email.   It would be helpful to begin to identify whether there are high-risk periods for marijuana initiation such as the first six weeks of college, as the study authors suggest, or specific events such as 21st birthdays, particularly for students living in states where recreational marijuana use is legal for those 21 and over.     “If we can identify certain risk periods, it would be easier for colleges to target resources and prevention activities to those times,” she said.  "
2q9rRPG,2017-04-27,Many exercise options are tied to better brain function," (Reuters Health) - Older adults who want to get moving to help boost their brain function have a wide variety of workouts to choose from, a research review suggests.    Among the many options for working out over 50, tai chi may have the biggest effect on cognitive function, but aerobic and resistance exercises may also have some benefit, the review found.    “Age is a risk factor no one can avoid when it comes to cognitive decline and other neurological disorders such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease,” said lead study author Joe Northey of the University of Canberra Research Institute for Sport and Exercise in Australia.    “As our study shows, undertaking just a few days of moderate intensity aerobic and resistance training during the week is a simple and effective way to improve the way your brain functions while also reducing the impact of other risk factors for cognitive decline such as obesity and diabetes,” Northey said by email.    Some previous research suggests that heart-healthy lifestyle choices like avoiding cigarettes, eating a balanced diet and getting plenty of exercise may help stall the cognitive decline that happens with age, but these studies offer a mixed picture of what type of activity is best.    For the current review, Northey and colleagues analyzed data from 36 previously published studies looking at how much the intensity and frequency of different types of exercise was associated with improvements in cognitive function in people 50 and older.    Studies in the analysis were controlled experiments that randomly assigned some participants to specific exercise interventions to assess how activity influenced cognition.    While researchers included people with varying levels of cognitive ability, they excluded patients with a history of stroke, depression or other mental illnesses.    Across all the studies, they compared the average amount of improvement for different types of exercises and found the largest gains associated with tai chi, a Chinese meditation practice that combines deep breathing and slow, fluid movements.   Aerobic exercise, resistance training and workouts that blended different types of physical activity were also associated with gains in cognitive function, but didn’t have as much of an effect as tai chi, researchers report in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.    In particular, working memory improved with tai chi and resistance training, which was also associated with gains in executive function.    Yoga had a slight impact on brain function, but it was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    Workouts of 45 to 60 minutes were associated with significant improvements in cognitive function, which weren’t seen with shorter or longer exercise sessions.    As for the intensity of workouts, light exercise didn’t have an effect on cognitive function but both moderate and vigorous exercise was associated with similar and meaningful gains, the study found.    Exercising more often was associated with bigger gains in cognitive ability, but there was still an improvement with no more than two workouts a week, the study found.    One limitation of the study is that the analysis focused on supervised exercise interventions, which might not reflect what people would do in the real world, the authors note.    Still, the study offers fresh evidence that the biggest benefits of exercise on brain health are expected with higher amounts, like 45 minutes or more multiple times a week, said Dr. Jeffrey Burns, co-director of the University of Kansas Alzheimer’s Disease Center in Kansas City.   “More exercise is likely better for driving brain benefits than modest amounts but we also know that some is better than none, especially for other physical benefits,” Burns, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “So the key message from this study is don’t just exercise for heart health, exercise also to promote your brain health.”  "
2q7krgL,2017-04-26,Yoga tied to better quality of life with ulcerative colitis," (Reuters Health) - Weekly yoga sessions may be associated with a better quality of life for patients with ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can be exacerbated by stress, a small study suggests.                     People practice yoga in Times Square as part of a Summer Solstice and International Day of Yoga celebration in New York June 21, 2015. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz       People with ulcerative colitis have inflammation in the lining of the large intestine that can lead to symptoms like diarrhea and abdominal pain. When symptoms are severe, patients may have sudden loose or bloody stools so often that it impairs their ability to navigate normal daily activities like going to school or work.    Researchers studied 77 ulcerative colitis patients who reported a reduced quality of life due to the disease even though their symptoms were clinically in remission. They randomly assigned participants to receive either 12 weekly yoga sessions or written self-care advice and found the yoga group had greater improvements in quality of life.    “It seems to be safe and effective, so it is surely worth trying yoga as an add-on to other evidence-based interventions at least for maintenance of remission,” said lead study author Dr. Holger Cramer, a researcher at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany.    “It definitely should not be used as a replacement but rather as an ancillary intervention,” Cramer said by email. “That’s how it was used in our study.”   Previous research has linked higher perceived stress levels to more severe ulcerative colitis symptoms, and other studies have also tied yoga to reduced stress in both healthy and sick people, researchers note in the journal Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics.    While there isn’t a standard treatment regimen that’s the same for all patients with ulcerative colitis, they may take a variety of different drugs to curb inflammation and achieve symptom remission. In more severe cases, they may need surgery to remove the colon and rectum.    At the start of the current study, patients had been in remission for at least four weeks and no longer than one year.    People were excluded if they weren’t in remission and had active symptoms, if they had surgery to remove their colon, or if they had medical problems that would make it hard for them to do even light yoga exercises.    Patients assigned to yoga during the study took 90-minute classes in what’s known as hatha yoga, with postures and breathing exercises designed to calm the body and mind. People in the yoga group were also given manuals to try poses at home and encouraged to keep a daily log of their practice time.    Everyone in the control group of self-care patients received two books with general information on ulcerative colitis and strategies for improving symptoms with lifestyle modifications, medication and other approaches. They were asked not to start a yoga practice or any other exercise regimen during the study.    With yoga, people reported a better quality of life after 12 weeks of classes, and again three months later.     Five patients in the yoga group had side effects like musculoskeletal pain that may have been related to the yoga, while none of the mild side effects in the self-care group appeared related to this intervention.    One limitation of the study is that many patients dropped out of the yoga class, mainly because it proved too time consuming, the authors note. It’s also possible that personal attention from yoga instructors contributed to outcomes for that group rather than the yoga itself, the researchers point out.    Still, some previous studies suggest that stress reduction may have direct anti-inflammatory effects, which may explain why yoga reduced disease activity and flares in patients with ulcerative colitis in the current study, said Dr. Gilaad Kaplan, a gastroenterologist, at the University of Calgary in Canada.    “Yoga should not replace the medications that help patients with ulcerative colitis go into remission,” Kaplan, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “But yoga may serve as complementary intervention, particularly in patients experiencing stress or whose quality of life is poor.”  "
2qeExEZ,2017-04-26,Pregnancy complications await childhood cancer survivors," (Reuters Health) - Women who manage to conceive after surviving childhood cancer may encounter treatment-related pregnancy and labor complications if they got radiation for their malignancies, a recent study suggests.                     A pregnant woman, in the last trimester of her pregnancy, poses in this illustration photo in Sete, South France, March 26, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau      Female cancer survivors who got abdominal radiation are more than three times more likely to develop diabetes during pregnancy as their peers who received different tumor treatments, the study found. After radiation, these cancer survivors are also more than twice as likely to develop anemia during pregnancy.    Survivors of Wilms tumors, a rare type of childhood kidney cancer, had more than three times the risk of high blood pressure during pregnancy when their treatment included abdominal or pelvic radiation.    When they didn’t get radiation, however, female cancer survivors didn’t appear to have any greater risk of labor complications than women who never had cancer, the study also found.   “It is reassuring that the majority of women who survived childhood cancer and who became pregnant are not at increased risk of developing specific adverse labor complications compared to the general population,” said lead study author Raoul Reulen of the Center for Childhood Cancer Studies at the University of Birmingham in the UK.    Survival from childhood cancer has improved dramatically in recent decades, and roughly four in five kids diagnosed with tumors survive at least five years, researchers note.    “It is important that women who have been treated for childhood cancer and who want to become pregnant or are pregnant are aware of the specific treatments (e.g. radiotherapy, chemotherapy) they received as a child and discuss the potential implications of the treatment on the pregnancy with their obstetrician,” Reulen said by email.    For the study, researchers examined data on a total of 2,783 singleton pregnancies among 1,712 childhood cancer survivors. All of the women were diagnosed with tumors by age 14.    Women were typically around 29 years old when they delivered their babies. The majority of them had survived leukemia, central nervous system tumors or Wilms.    A total of 1,183 women received any radiation as part of their cancer treatment, and 205 of them had abdominal radiation.    Women who got abdominal radiation were 46 percent more likely to have elective cesarean deliveries compared to the general population of pregnant women who didn’t have childhood cancer. Cancer survivors who didn’t have abdominal radiation were 39 percent more likely to have elective cesareans.    Emergency cesarean rates were similar regardless of cancer history.   While the study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how radiation leads to pregnancy complications, it’s possible radiation causes kidney damage that contributes to anemia and elevated blood pressure, or increases the risk of diabetes by harming the pancreas, the authors note.     One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked records on the doses of radiation or chemotherapy patients received, and they also didn’t know the site of radiation for some survivors.     Still, the study offers fresh insight into pregnancy complications that may follow childhood cancer, said Dr. Daniel Green of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.     “We already knew about pregnancy related hypertension after abdominal irradiation, and about diabetes (but not pregnancy related diabetes) after abdominal irradiation,” Green, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “We did not know there was an increased risk for anemia during pregnancy.”   Ideally, cancer survivors should consider these risks before trying to conceive, said Dr. Kutluk Oktay, director of the Innovation Institute for Fertility Preservation in New York.    “Cancer survivors should seek preconception evaluation from maternal fetal specialists before attempting pregnancy,” Oktay, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

2pf6lKf,2017-04-25,Gender viewpoints similar in trans preschoolers and other kids," (Reuters Health) - Transgender preschoolers are no less confident than their peers about their gender, a new study found.   They were just as likely as non-transgender children to say their gender as grownups would be the same as their gender in preschool.    “These new findings show that, for example, transgender girls believe they will grow up to be women just as much as other girls believe they will grow up to be women,” said senior author Kristina Olson, of the University of Washington in Seattle. “Same thing for transgender boys. Our groups were equally confident about their future gender being stable.”   People who are transgender do not identify with the sex assigned to them at birth. A person born with the anatomy of a female may identify as male, or vice versa. Sometimes, people don’t identify with either gender. People whose gender identity and anatomy do match are known as cisgender.   Writing in the journal Child Development, Olson and her co-author Anne Fast quote a previous study from New Zealand that estimates about 1.2 percent of people are transgender.   Olson’s previous research found that transgender and cisgender elementary school students reach gender-related milestones at a similar pace.   The new study focused on preschoolers. Researchers interviewed children between the ages of 3 and 5 years, including 36 who were transgender, 24 who were cisgender with a transgender sibling and 36 cisgender children without transgender siblings.   Along with observing how the children dressed, the researchers also asked how they saw themselves as adults, what they thought of the adult or childhood genders of people in pictures, what toys they’d like to play with and who among people in pictures would be their friends.   Overall, transgender children answered similarly to their cisgender peers of the same gender.   For example, children who identified as male were likely to gravitate toward objects that are stereotypically masculine, like an orange tool set or red barbecue set. Meanwhile, children who identified as girls gravitated toward stereotypically feminine objects, like a pink and sparkly dress.   Transgender children did differ from their cisgender peers when asked about their gender as babies. For example, a transgender child identifying as female would say she was a boy as a baby, while a cisgender preschooler identifying as female would say she was a girl as an infant.   Olson’s team isn’t sure why transgender children view their gender in infancy as different from their gender in preschool. The children may be parroting what they’ve heard from adults about their birth, Olson said in an email.   “They might also hear this question as being about how people used to treat them versus how they treat them now,” Olson added. “More research is necessary to figure out exactly what is happening here.”   The new study shows transgender children demonstrate the same developmental gender hallmarks as children who are not transgender, she said.   “So this paper, like our past study, shows that from the perspective of the child’s identified gender, these socially-transitioned transgender children look just like most other kids,” said Olson.  "
2oIRDdv,2017-04-25,Can playground design help reduce bullying?," (Reuters Health) - Playgrounds designed with risk-taking in mind may mean more pushing and shoving during recess, but they also might make kids less likely to feel bullied, a small experiment in New Zealand suggests.    For the study, researchers randomly selected eight elementary schools to get modified playgrounds with lots of loose and moving parts, chances to socialize and build things, and opportunities to play with bikes and skateboards. A control group of eight schools kept their traditional playgrounds.    After two years, children at the schools with modified playgrounds were about 33 percent more likely to report pushing and shoving during recess than kids at schools with traditional playgrounds, researchers report in Pediatrics. With modified playgrounds, however, kids were 31 percent less likely to report bullying to teachers.    “To us, the findings that intervention children reported more pushing and shoving yet were less likely to tell a teacher were fascinating,” said senior study author Rachael Taylor of the University of Otago in New Zealand.   The study doesn’t shed light on why this happened, so it’s hard to say whether kids got better at resolving disputes on their own or perhaps became more resilient to behavior that might have felt like bullying before, Taylor said by email.   Researchers assessed all of the existing playgrounds at the 16 primary schools included in the study, then made changes to half of the spaces to encourage more risk-taking and challenges.    Along with modified physical spaces to play, the study also encouraged schools with altered playgrounds to change rules for recess to allow things like tree climbing, rough-and-tumble play and going outside even on rainy days.    A total of 840 kids started the study, and 630 of them remained after two years. Children ranged in age from 6 to 9 years old.    With modified playgrounds, kids were 66 percent more likely to report playing with a lot of children after one year, and after two years they were also 64 percent more likely to report being happy at school.    After one year, parents of kids who had modified playgrounds were almost twice as likely to say kids had happy relationships with other students. But after two years, the reverse was true.    Teachers didn’t report differences in name-calling or cruel teasing based on whether playgrounds were altered for the study. But teachers did report more physical bullying and deliberate exclusion with modified playgrounds.    The main limitation of the study is that bullying is difficult to assess, the authors note. In addition, the study was too small to detect meaningful differences between girls and boys and had too few teachers to draw many conclusions from what educators observed.    Even so, the results suggest it may make sense to move from play areas that are more structured to spaces that offer an element of risk and fewer rules, said Sarah Clark, co-director of the C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital National Poll on Children’s Health at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.    “Too often, parents’ inclination is to remove anything that could be potentially risky and they push schools to do the same - but that inclination works against kids’ developmental need to use play as a way to challenge themselves,” Clark, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “So parents, back off and allow kids a little more freedom in their play space and style.”   Kids need chances to play with fewer rules, said Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a researcher at Seattle Children’s Hospital and the University of Washington who wasn’t involved in the study.    So what should parents tell their children about playtime?   “Take risks; Band-Aids are there for a reason,” Breuner said by email. “I will be there when you need me but not when you don’t.”  "
2q83PES,2017-04-24,Canada recommends against testing everyone for hepatitis C," (Reuters Health) - Adults who don’t have an increased risk of hepatitis C infection should not be tested for it, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommended today.   The Task Force found no evidence that screening low-risk adults would be beneficial. Also, it said, screening all adults would require a lot of resources.   “For the average Canadian at average risk, don’t screen,” said Task Force member Dr. Roland Grad, who chaired the group that crafted the new recommendation.   Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people with chronic hepatitis C are often symptom-free for many years, but they can end up with severe liver disease.   Based on its review of the evidence, published in the journal CMAJ,  the Task Force estimates a one-time screening of 100,000 Canadians would find 199 chronic hepatitis C infections and save about 40 lives, but at a substantial cost.    The Task Force says just focusing on screening people with symptoms and signs of hepatitis C would find 91 cases among every 100,000 Canadians.   The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) - the Canadian Task Force’s counterpart in the United States - also reserves hepatitis C screenings for people at an increased risk of infection, including current or former injection drug users, people who were incarcerated, and those who’ve spent time in places where the infection is common.   The USPSTF also recommends one-time hepatitis C screening for anyone born between 1945 and 1965. It says these individuals are at higher risk for hepatitis C, possibly due to blood transfusions and other exposures long ago.   “At the moment, we can’t make a recommendation for all Canadians regardless of what year you were born in to be screened for hepatitis C,” said Grad, who is also affiliated with McGill University in Montreal.   He said the prevalence of hepatitis C in Canada is different than that of the U.S. population.   The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care writes that between 220,000 and 245,000 people in the country have a chronic hepatitis C infection. In the U.S., the CDC puts that number at 3.1 million.   Grad added that unlike the USPSTF, the Canadian Task Force takes finances and resources into account when creating its recommendations.   The Canadian Task Force says recommending against universal screening allows the country to focus its resources on testing those at highest risk for the infection.   Dr. Ellie Carmody, who was not involved with the new recommendation, says the recommendation against screening may be relevant to Canada, but the USPSTF’s recommendation is right for the U.S.   “Screening in the U.S., particularly among the baby boomers, is and continues to be a priority,” said Carmody, who is an assistant professor of infectious diseases at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York.   “Canada is in a different circumstance and at greater resource constraints and a lower prevalence of hepatitis C (and) that changes the risk-benefit profile of screening,” she told Reuters Health.

2pM6AMS,2017-04-21,Most Americans support restrictions on where firearms can be carried," (Reuters Health) - More than two-thirds of Americans surveyed support some restrictions on carrying firearms in public places.   “One of the findings that surprised us was that, even among gun owners, there was strong support for placing at least some restrictions on the public places where legal gun owners can carry firearms,” Julia A. Wolfson from University of Michigan School of Public Health in Ann Arbor told Reuters Health by email.    Even among politically conservative gun owners, nearly 80 percent supported placing some restrictions on where guns should be carried, she said.   According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, only three states (California, Florida, and Illinois) and the District of Columbia prohibit openly carrying firearms in all public places.    Wolfson’s team surveyed nearly 4,000 Americans about their views about specific public places where guns should be allowed to be legally carried. They oversampled veterans and adults living in homes with guns so they could explore questions related to gun ownership patterns and practices among veterans.    Restaurants (33 percent), service settings (31 percent), and retail stores (31 percent) were the only locations in which more than 30 percent of Americans thought people should be allowed to carry guns, the researchers reported in the American Journal of Public Health.    There was much less support for carrying guns on college campuses (23 percent), places of worship (21 percent), schools (19 percent), bars (18 percent), and sports stadiums (17 percent).   More gun owners supported allowing guns to be carried in restaurants (59 percent), college campuses (38 percent), bars (26 percent), and sports stadiums (27 percent).    Very few Americans supported allowing people to carry guns in all public places: 16 percent of gun owners, 9 percent of non-gun owners in households with guns, and 7 percent of non-gun owners in non-gun households.    About half of people in households without guns felt that guns should not be allowed to be carried in any public place, compared with 42 percent of non-gun owners in households with guns and 25 percent of gun owners.    Male gun owners were more likely than female gun owners to support allowing guns to be carried in all locations, and, regardless of gun ownership status, those calling themselves political liberals were less likely than those calling themselves political conservatives to support allowing guns to be carried in some or all public places.   Still, four out of five conservative gun owners also supported placing some restrictions on the public places where guns can be carried.    “In this study, we find that the majority of Americans, including most gun owners, support restricting the public places where legal gun owners can carry firearms,” Wolfson concluded. “This indicates that the recent legislative actions of state legislatures to expand the places where people can carry guns contrasts sharply with American public opinion.”    “Public opinion about the public places where guns should be allowed to be carried is at odds with proposed federal legislation that would require ‘reciprocity’ for gun carrying,” she said. “This proposed legislation, if passed, would mean that a gun owner whose state allows him or her to carry a gun in most places may be able to legally carry the gun in such places while in a state with more restrictive laws. Given the low public support for allowing guns to be carried in public places, this would seem to go against the will of the majority of Americans.”     Dr. Emmy Betz from University of Colorado School of Medicine and Colorado School of Public Health, Denver, has also examined these issues. She told Reuters Health by email, “This is the most in-depth examination I’ve seen of what the public thinks about carrying firearms in public. The variation in views - and the fact that overall views weren’t as supportive of public carrying as basic polls suggest - highlights how important research in this area is.”   “I am not a political scholar,” Dr. Betz said, “but as a believer in democracy, I have to hope that civic engagement (voting, expressing opinions to elected officials, engaging in informed debate, etc.) can overcome special interests or lobbying on any topic. And, as an advocate for evidence-based policy, I emphasize the need for funded, non-partisan science to provide the evidence for such policies.”    She added, “We are a diverse nation, and we need to talk with (and listen to) each other as we find ways to enhance the health and safety of our country.”  "
2oREFN1,2017-04-21,Hot flashes at younger ages may signal higher heart risk later," Women who start having hot flashes in their 40s and early 50s had signs of poorer blood vessel health in a recent study and may be at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease later on, researchers say.    “Hot flashes were considered solely quality of life issues. Few investigators have considered their links with women’s heart health,” lead author Rebecca Thurston of the Women’s Biobehavioral Health Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh told Reuters Health by email.   In their study of 272 postmenopausal women, ages 40 to 60,  Thurston and her team found a connection between hot flashes at younger ages and impaired function of the lining of the women’s blood vessels.    The health of the lining, known as the endothelium, is commonly assessed by measuring how well the endothelial cells respond to signals that would ordinarily cause the blood vessel to expand.   In women who were having hot flashes at ages 40 to 53, the endothelial cells lining the artery showed poorer responsiveness to those signals, which is typically an indication of increased risk for cardiovascular disease later in life.    This was not true for women of the same age who were not having hot flashes. Nor was the link between hot flashes and endothelial dysfunction seen among older women, ages 54 to 60 years.   None of the women were smokers, and none of them had been diagnosed with any cardiovascular diseases.   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of women’s death, and hot flashes affect 70 percent of women, Thurston said.   Each hot flash can last about a minute or so, and they occur over the course of a decade for many women. The participants in the study showed an average of six recorded hot flashes per 24-hour period.   For reasons as yet unknown, waking hot flashes may indicate a higher risk than hot flashes during sleep, the researchers found.   Whereas previous studies regarding hot flashes and cardiovascular risk were observational and based on reports by the women themselves, this new study involved real-time hot flash monitoring, blood tests, and ultrasound measurement of blood flow in the arm. For this reason, the investigators say, their results are superior to previous studies.    The researchers also took into account women’s other cardiovascular risk factors and the lower levels of estrogen found in older women, which itself can cause poorer blood vessel function.   A weakness of the study was that the average participant was white and college educated, which might mean the results don’t apply to other types of women.    Dr. JoAnn Manson of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston was one of the lead investigators on a 2011 study of participants in the large-scale Women’s Health Initiative which found a similar connection between hot flashes and impaired blood vessel dilation – but in women ages 54 to 60.    “The relationship between menopausal hot flashes and cardiovascular risk remains controversial, and this paper does not provide a definitive answer,” Manson told Reuters Health by email.   “In the present study, an association between hot flashes and impaired blood vessel dilation was found in the youngest women, but not in women aged 54-60 (who were in early-to-middle stages of menopause),” said Manson. “In the Women’s Health Initiative, the largest study to date, the opposite was found: hot flashes in late, but not early menopause, were linked to increased cardiovascular risk. Thus, the hot flashes-cardiovascular disease puzzle continues to be incomplete, with many missing pieces.”   In the meantime, the American Heart Association points out on its website that preventing cardiovascular diseases requires “smart choices.” The AHA adds, “Lack of exercise, a poor diet and other unhealthy habits can take their toll over the years. . . . No matter what your age, everyone can benefit from a healthy diet and adequate physical activity.”  "
2oPuHf0,2017-04-21,"Wearable sensor collects, tests sweat for cystic fibrosis, glucose levels"," (Reuters Health) - A next step in wearable health sensors might be a device that causes a patch of skin to sweat, then analyzes the perspiration to monitor or even diagnose disease.   Researchers used a prototype to extract sweat from volunteers with the lung disease cystic fibrosis, measure specific compounds that are signatures of the disease, then transmit the data wirelessly for further analysis.    They did a similar experiment to see if sugar levels in sweat rose in tandem with blood sugar.   “With the technology that we’ve made use of we could really move faster into personalized care by using devices that can allow for real-time monitoring,” study coauthor Dr. Carlos Milla of Stanford University in California told Reuters Health. “There’s a large number of things that you can measure in sweat that can be very valuable.”   While sweat testing offers a “noninvasive and rich source of information,” Milla and his team write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the difficulty of collecting adequate amounts of sweat in sedentary individuals has limited its usefulness in cystic fibrosis (CF) diagnosis.    Presently, CF testing must be done in certified labs, in a two-step process that takes hours and typically requires two technicians. The prototype consists of an interface that stimulates sweating then draws the sweat, integrated with an analysis platform. It can do the job in a single step, without causing discomfort to the patient, the researchers write. Readings can be transmitted via smartphone for review by a specialized center, which transmits results back to the phone.   In their experiment, the researchers tested the device in six healthy individuals and three CF patients to measure levels of sodium and chloride in sweat. The healthy volunteers had normal sodium and chloride levels while levels in the individuals with CF were about four times higher.     The investigators also tested sweat glucose levels in seven healthy individuals who consumed 30 grams of oral glucose after fasting. In six of the study subjects, sweat glucose levels rose along with glucose levels in the blood.   Using the device to test sodium and chloride in sweat currently takes about half an hour, Milla noted, and the researchers are working to speed up the process. They are also planning large studies to investigate how sweat-sensor readings correlate with health.   “Our solution opens the possibility for a broad range of noninvasive diagnostic and general population health monitoring applications,” the researchers conclude.

2pjWyFD,2017-04-21,More teen knowledge about concussion may not increase reporting," (Reuters Health) - High school athletes with access to a certified athletic trainer are more knowledgeable about concussions and their consequences, but that doesn’t make them  more likely to report a concussion, a U.S. study finds.   “The underreporting of concussions is estimated to be high, and the No. 1 reason athletes do not report a concussion is because they do not want to lose playing time,” lead study author Jessica Wallace of Youngstown State University in Ohio said by email.   Although experts estimate that athletic trainers are present in 86 percent of U.S. high schools, only about 37 percent of high schools employ one full-time. In high schools with no athletic trainer, athletes are five times more likely to not report concussion symptoms because they didn’t know they had a concussion, Wallace told Reuters Health.   Sports-related concussions account for about 4 percent to 9 percent of high school injuries and have symptoms such as headaches, confusion, nausea, amnesia and trouble sleeping.   “This study sheds light on the multiple reasons why student-athletes may not report a concussion, including not thinking the injury was serious enough to require medical attention or not wanting to let the team down,” Wallace said.   She and her colleagues surveyed 715 student athletes ages 13 to 19, including 438 students who had access to an athletic trainer. Athletes answered 83 questions about their own concussion history, concussion knowledge, responses in specific scenarios, signs and symptoms of a concussion and reasons why an athlete would not report a concussion.    Overall, 55 percent of high school athletes underreported concussions. Eighty-seven percent of athletes from schools without athletic trainers understood the dangers of concussions, as compared to 94 percent from the schools with athletic trainers.    Similarly, 61 percent of athletes from schools without athletic trainers understood the signs and symptoms of a concussion, compared to 78 percent from the schools with athletic trainers.    Overall, in the schools without athletic trainers, 16 percent more athletes thought they could continue playing if they believed they had a concussion and 12 percent more athletes thought they could continue playing with concussion symptoms. This knowledge gap is prominent and should be addressed, the study authors write in a special concussion-themed issue of the Journal of Athletic Training.   “The athletic trainer serves a vital role in the health and safety of high-school athletes,” Wallace said. “One of the athletic trainer’s responsibilities is to help educate athletes, coaches and parents about concussions that appear to be happening within high schools.”   At the same time, access to an athletic trainer wasn’t linked to a higher proportion of concussions being reported, the study found.   In the survey, about 46 percent of the students said they had experienced a potential concussion during play and only 21 percent had reported it to an authority figure at the time. About 19 percent of these incidents were reported in schools without athletic trainers, compared to 25 percent in schools with athletic trainers, a difference too small to rule out the possibility it was due to chance.   “This multifaceted issue includes many reasons why students may choose not to disclose an injury, including knowledge, intention and attitude,” said Johna Register-Mihalik of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who developed the concussion survey used in the current study but was not part of the study team.   One limitation of the study is that the students came from 14 schools in two Michigan metro areas and participated in football, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, gymnastics, soccer or cheerleading, which may limit how broadly the results can be generalized, the authors note.   The Michigan students received state-mandated concussion education based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HEADS UP program. Wallace and colleagues recommend that this or a similar education program be used to target schools without an athletic trainer in order to talk about the signs, symptoms and dangers of concussion.   “Improving concussion protocol will extend into other issues with student athletes, such as lack of mental health disclosure and allowing play when athletes are injured or sick,” Register-Mihalik said. “Involving parents, coaches and students can create a safe playing environment.”  "
2oricDJ,2017-04-20,Rape victims in U.S. made to pay part of the medical bill," (Reuters Health) - Women who have been sexually assaulted in the U.S. often bear some costs for testing and other medical treatment when they report the rape to authorities, according to a new study.   Victims with private insurance pay on average $950, or 14 percent, of the cost of medical services, and the insurance providers pay about $5,789, researchers found.   “With other violent crimes, victims are not responsible for paying for the damage that results from the crime,” lead author Ashley Tennessee told Reuters Health. “Many people know sexual assault is an issue, but they’re often unaware that victims have to pay for associated medical charges,” said Tennessee, of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.   In 2013, insurance providers and victims paid more than $9 million for medical services related to sexual assault, the study authors write in the American Journal of Public Health. The average cost was $6,737 per case.   The Violence Against Women Act, passed in 1994 and reauthorized in 2013, requires states to pay for sexual assault forensic exams, known as “rape kits.” However, hospital billing procedures often include more services than those associated with the rape kit alone, and forensic costs also vary by state.    Tennessee and colleagues looked at hospital billing records for privately insured women in the U.S. who were victims of rape in 2013. They identified 1,355 assaults, with 98 percent of victims not admitted to the hospital. The 32 patients who were admitted to the hospital paid an average of $788 for their inpatient stay. The others paid an average of $316 for outpatient costs.    Of the group, about 7 percent filled a prescription for pain medication, antibiotics, HIV prevention drugs, emergency contraceptives or sleep or anxiety medication. These 214 victims spent an average of $48 to fill prescriptions.    Overall, about 88 percent of the 1,355 victims incurred charges on the day they visited the hospital, and 27 percent paid more than 25 percent of those costs. About 7 percent paid more than 50 percent of the cost. After visiting the hospital, about 63 percent of the patients incurred more charges up to a month after the incident, including prescriptions, further medical care and mental health services.   “This financial burden adds to the emotional burden of sexual assault,” Tennessee said. “This is an area that society has missed, and we have a moral right to help victims.”   A limitation of the study is that the data didn’t include men or LGBTQ victims of sexual assault. It also doesn’t account for publicly insured victims or homeless women who may face a greater risk for assault due to environmental and social factors related to poverty, the authors note.   “Follow-up studies must look at the prevalence in these groups,” Tennessee said. “We want victims to know they’re not alone in this journey and recovery process, and that includes studying and informing all groups about their access to funding resources.”   “We encourage all victims of sexual assault to get a medical exam following the incident. Anything that is a barrier to ensuring victims are physically OK is bad for them and the community,” said Scott Berkowitz, president and founder of the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network (RAINN) in Washington, D.C. told Reuters Health.   “Congressional attention has been focused on making sure victims aren’t charged for the rape kit and forensic evidence, and there hasn’t been as much attention paid to making sure they aren’t charged for the other medical costs that result,” he told Reuters Health by email.   Tennessee and Berkowitz suggest emergency room personnel and hospital workers inform victims about charity funds that hospitals and states offer to reimburse those out-of-pocket costs. The Violence Against Women Act will be reauthorized next year, and RAINN and other sexual assault groups are urging lawmakers to update the funding definitions and mechanisms to cover additional costs.   “There are still too many barriers for victims and too many ways we discourage them from coming forward and reporting to police,” Berkowitz said. “Receiving a rape kit exam at a hospital is an important first step in reporting incidents to police.”  "
2pjU0al,2017-04-20,Diabetes control tied to heart stent outcomes," (Reuters Health) - For people with type 2 diabetes, maintaining good blood sugar control in the years after receiving a coronary artery stent is associated with a lower risk of heart attack and stroke, according to a recent study.   “Although intensive glucose control had no benefit on the rate of major cardiovascular events in previous studies, our data suggest that strict glucose control after PCI (heart catheterization) can improve long-term clinical outcomes in diabetic patients,” Dr. Joo-Yong Hahn from Samsung Medical Center in Seoul told Reuters Health.    Heart disease is the major cause of death among people with type 2 diabetes, Hahn’s team writes in Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions. Although intensive blood sugar control is known to reduce damage to tiny blood vessels that are involved in many of the nerve and circulatory effects of diabetes, it’s not clear if the same is true for major arteries such as the ones that carry blood to the heart.   The researchers studied 980 patients with type 2 diabetes who had undergone percutaneous cardiac intervention (PCI) to clear a blocked coronary artery and place a supportive mesh tube known as a stent. Hahn’s team followed the patients’ health for up to seven years.    They looked at long-term blood sugar control using a measurement known as hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c or A1C), and used it to compare the patients’ risks of death, heart attack, repeat catheterizations and stroke over the study period.   The researchers defined good control as an A1C score below 7.0 and poor control as A1C of 7.0 or higher. Then they matched patients according to other risk factors and ended up with 322 pairs of patients for comparison.    In the overall group of 980 patients, the risk of all bad outcomes was 25 percent lower with good blood glucose control than with poor blood glucose control.   In the matched comparison, some 37 percent of patients with poor control had bad outcomes (heart attack, stroke, and so on) over the next seven years, versus less than 28 percent of patients with good control. Most of the difference in bad outcomes between the groups resulted from a higher rate of repeat stenting in the group with poor blood glucose control.    “PCI is not the end of treatment for coronary artery disease,” Hahn said by email. “Optimal medical treatment, including glycemic control, is a cornerstone therapy after PCI,” he said.   “The effects of glucose control in type 2 diabetes may differ according to patient characteristics, such as recent cardiovascular events, baseline glycemic control status and duration of diabetes,” Hahn added.    The researchers write that more study is needed before they can conclude strict glucose control after stenting will improve long-term clinical outcomes in people with diabetes.    It’s important to underscore the message of good glycemic control, said Dr. Azfar G. Zaman from Newcastle University in the UK. He was not involved in the study but has done similar research. “In patients with PCI there is evidence to support better outcomes and need for fewer interventions,” Zaman said by email.    “This is a single center study with limited numbers, but the findings support data from other studies,” he noted.

2pH37ll,2017-04-20,GREEN Tool offers evidence-based guidance for school garden success," (Reuters Health) – Planting a successful school garden requires a lot more than just soil, seeds and water, say researchers who have come up with a planning tool that can help ensure school gardens thrive and endure.    A teacher or parent may be the driving force behind getting a garden started, but once the teacher leaves the school, or the parent’s child graduates, gardens can wither away unless they have been well integrated into the school community, the study team writes in Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.   School gardens have a host of health and educational benefits, from getting kids to eat more fruits and vegetables to boosting academic achievement in science, math and reading, they write.   To better understand what it takes to help a garden thrive, Kate Gardner Burt of Lehman College in New York City and her colleagues looked at successful gardens at 21 local elementary and middle schools, and mapped out the characteristics of gardens that played an enduring role in the life of the school.    Based on these findings, Burt and colleagues defined a four-level process toward successful school garden integration. Dubbed the GREEN Tool, it’s the first evidence-based guide to planting and nurturing sustainable school gardens, the researchers say.   Among the common themes for success that emerged in the research, Burt noted in a telephone interview, was that schools that established a garden committee early on were able to cope with challenges more successfully.   “The other really important piece to integrating the garden that consistently came up in my discussions and interviews was the idea of professional development,” she added. “Many teachers who don’t have horticultural experience might be really intimidated to get into the garden.”    Professional development sessions that focused on the garden - even informal ones hosted by a garden coordinator at lunch or after school - can help motivate teachers and build their confidence, she added.   Having neighborhood partners and reliable funding for the garden were found to be important keys to sustainability. The planning of the physical garden space and planning for upkeep were also identified as critical components.   Connecting the garden to curriculum was another key step. Once teachers become more comfortable with the garden, they can begin to see the possibilities for teaching through planting and gardening, Burt said. “Using gardens as a mechanism to teach math, that opens teachers up to all kinds of grant possibilities and opportunities.”   In the surveys, for example, more than 95 percent of the schools used the garden for teaching science or nutrition classes. Another 76 percent used it to teach agriculture, 71 percent used the garden for English language arts, 67 percent used it for math, 62 percent for environmental science, history, health and home economics, and 57 percent of schools used the garden for art class.   Tying school gardens to academics can be another way to strengthen their roots, Burt said. “If students can learn any of the core academic subjects better by using the garden, then we can provide more compelling evidence for why gardening should be sustained in schools.”  "
2oUGABo,2017-04-20,Uninsured with traumatic injuries may be cured into destitution," (Reuters Health) - When a badly injured patient rolls into the emergency room, Dr. John Scott doesn’t ask to see proof of insurance. Instead, he immediately begins treatment.   Hospital care frequently saves patients from gunshots, stab wounds, crushing car accidents and other traumatic injuries. But Scott found in a new study that 7 out of 10 adult uninsured trauma patients suffer another debilitating injury: financial catastrophe.   “We’re getting better at trauma, and they’re going home financially ruined,” Scott said in a phone interview.   “Everyone in America’s at risk for an accidental injury, and not everyone’s protected from the financial consequences,” said Scott, lead author of the study and a surgery resident at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.   The study, reported in Annals of Surgery, is the first to couple data on U.S. trauma admissions with Census Bureau data on income to evaluate the risks of catastrophic health expenses.   Researchers analyzed 117,502 hospital admissions for uninsured 18- to 64-year-olds admitted for trauma care from 2007 to 2011, before implementation of the Affordable Care Act.   Overall, half the patients had an estimated annual income below $40,867, and half had hospital charges of at least $27,420, not counting charges from doctors, who bill separately.   In other words, one unforeseen major injury could potentially cost well over half of someone’s annual income.    Previous studies have examined the impact of hospitalizations on so-called medical bankruptcies. But most who file for bankruptcy in the aftermath of medical crises are middle-class Americans with health insurance, the authors write, while the poorest uninsured often never declare bankruptcy.    To capture poorer uninsured Americans, Scott used the “catastrophic health expenditure” metric, which the World Health Organization uses to compare out-of-pocket expenses to income.   Scott defined catastrophic health spending as out-of-pocket health costs that were more than 40 percent of a patient’s income after they paid for food.   By that definition, nearly 71 percent of uninsured 18- to 64-year-old trauma patients - or more than 82,000 men and women - risk financial calamity every year.   Patients with the lowest incomes were at highest risk - 78 percent - of destitution. But even those with the highest incomes had a 53 percent risk of a medically induced fiscal catastrophe, the study found.   Dr. David Himmelstein, a professor at the City University of New York’s Hunter College School of Public Health, described the study as “quite sophisticated.” It “paints an extraordinarily disturbing picture of America’s vulnerability,” he said in an email.   “This study shows that someone who is in a car accident, or is mugged, or experiences sudden trauma for some other reason, risks being driven to financial ruin,” he added.   “In essence, unless you’re Bill Gates, you could be at risk of financial catastrophe if you fall seriously ill,” said Himmelstein, who was not involved with the study.   The uninsured are not the only ones suffering the consequences of catastrophic health expenditures, Scott said. When hospitals fail to collect, they pass the costs onto paying customers and health-insurance companies, he said.   “More uncompensated care leads to higher costs for everybody else,” he said.   “For clinicians, it’s important to consider the financial strain as a complication of trauma care. Survival is not the only measure of good care,” he said.   But when a patient asks him how much a CT scan will cost, he has no idea.   Scott’s message to lawmakers considering changes to the Affordable Care Act: “Financial catastrophe is a reality for tens of thousands of Americans who haven’t planned for it. They’re being cured, but being cured into destitution.”   “There’s nobody we turn away for emergency trauma care. We don’t check people’s insurance status. We don’t check their wallet,” he said. “If everybody is deserving of world-class trauma care, everybody is deserving of protection from financial catastrophe from that care.”  "
2oRUwLS,2017-04-19,Fine particles in traffic pollution tied to lower ‘good’ cholesterol," (Reuters Health) - People who live near sources of heavy traffic exhaust may be at higher risk of heart disease because the fine particles in this type of pollution lower levels of “good” cholesterol needed for healthy blood flow, a U.S. study suggests.                     Gridlock traffic is pictured on highway 395 as people evacuate Washington after an earthquake August 23, 2011. REUTERS/Jason Reed        High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol helps curb the odds of heart disease by purging blood vessels of debris and lowering levels of triglycerides - dangerous fats that can make blood thicker, stickier and more prone to clots.    Researchers studied 6,654 adults and found people exposed to higher levels of fine and ultrafine particles in traffic pollution tended to have lower levels of HDL cholesterol in their blood.    “However, this was a fairly small effect - it wasn’t a dramatic lowering of HDL - so I don’t think this is a huge cause for alarm beyond what we already know about the dangers of air pollution,” said lead study author Griffith Bell of the University of Washington School of Public Health in Seattle.    Previous research has linked pollution from traffic exhaust to an increased risk of lung damage and respiratory diseases as well as cardiovascular disease and stroke.    For the current study, researchers focused on so-called PM 2.5, a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter that can include dust, dirt, soot and smoke. They also looked at what’s known as black carbon, a component of particulate pollution that’s formed by burning various kinds of fuels.     Study participants were 62 years old on average, and half of them were current or former smokers. About 16 percent of the participants took cholesterol-lowering drugs and roughly 45 percent had high blood pressure. None had cardiovascular disease at the start of the study period.   Researchers used participants’ home addresses to estimate average exposure to PM 2.5 and black carbon over 12-month, three-month and two-week periods in the year 2000.    They also looked at blood levels of HDL cholesterol and another measure known as HDL particle count, which some scientists believe may be a more accurate way to assess heart disease risk. Traditional cholesterol tests focus only on the quantity of cholesterol, but newer assessments look at the number of particles carrying cholesterol in the blood.    Over one year, people exposed to more black carbon had lower levels of HDL cholesterol than participants with little or no exposure to black carbon. The difference was small, but statistically meaningful.    Higher black carbon exposure over one year was also associated with lower HDL particle counts, but this difference was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance, researchers report in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology.    Over three months, however, the picture looked different.    In this shorter-term analysis, higher levels of fine particulate matter were associated with a lower HDL particle count. The slightly lower level of HDL cholesterol seen with high pollution exposure was too small a difference to rule out chance, but it was still comparable to the rise in HDL seen when smokers quit, the researchers note.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how traffic fumes directly influence cholesterol or the risk of heart disease.    One limitation of the study is the potential for pollutants other than black carbon or other fine particles to influence HDL, the authors note. In addition, they only measured HDL once, making it impossible to see how pollution exposures might impact cholesterol over time.    “We’re still not totally sure why air pollution might lower HDL, but it’s possible that inflammatory responses to air pollution might change some of the proteins in HDL, making it less effective at protecting the body from cardiovascular disease,” Bell said by email. “This is still an ongoing area of research, however.”   Previous research, however, has shown ambient air pollution such as fine particulate matter can cause hardening of the arteries as well as death from heart disease, said Dr. Frank Gilliland, a researcher at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.    Traffic pollutants have also been linked to death from heart disease in other studies, Gilliland, who wasn’t involved in the current study, said by email.    “People may want to plan their outdoor activities to avoid areas within 100 meters of major roads and freeways and-or other highly polluted areas,” Gilliland said.

2oOsMpf,2017-04-19,Sport-related concussions more common in high school girls," (Reuters Health) - In high school sports played by both girls and boys, girls are about 50 percent more likely to get a concussion, according to a recent U.S. study.   The reasons may have to do with physical or equipment differences and how often girls and boys report concussions they experience, but the result indicates a need for more research and better prevention strategies, researchers say.   “Parents and athletes alike should be active participants in concussion prevention,” said senior study author Dr. Zachary Y. Kerr from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in North Carolina.    “This needs to include more than just reviewing concussion fact sheets. This should include advocating to their high schools the importance of having concussion education and prevention programs that can help mitigate the incidence and severity of concussion,” he said by email.    Nearly 8 million U.S. high school students participate in sports every year, with more than 2 million competing in the sports where concussion is common: football, ice hockey, lacrosse and soccer, the study team writes in Journal of Athletic Training.   Kerr’s team used information from the National Athletic Treatment, Injury and Outcomes Network (NATION) surveillance program to determine concussion rates in 27 sports at 147 high schools in 26 states between 2011 and 2014.    Overall, there were nearly 4 sports-related concussions per 10,000 participations in practices or competitions, with the highest rates in football (9.21 concussions per 10,000 participations), boys’ lacrosse (6.65 per 10,000) and girls’ soccer (6.11 per 10,000).   Concussion rates were more than three times as common in competitions as during practice.    There were no reported concussions in boys’ crew, cross-country, golf, swimming and diving or in girls’ golf.    Player-to-player contact was the most common cause of concussion injury and accounted for about 60 percent of concussions in boys and about 40 percent in girls.    Among the many sports in which both sexes participated, including baseball, softball, basketball, crew, cross-country, lacrosse, soccer and others, sport-related concussion rates averaged 56 percent higher in girls than in boys.    In baseball and softball, girls’ concussion rate was four times that of boys.    Some recent research has shown that boys are less likely than girls to report concussion symptoms, which could be one explanation for the disparity, the authors note.   In addition, while player-to-player contact was the most common cause of concussions across the board, among just the girls, the biggest cause was player contact with equipment.    The authors point out that past research in girls’ soccer suggested the bigger ratio between the size of the ball and girls’ necks, compared to boys’ necks, might explain girls’ greater likelihood of concussion when heading a soccer ball. More research is needed to explore this question further, Kerr’s team writes.   In the current study, concussions were repeat injuries in just 3 percent of cases, and these recurrences were most common in girls’ field hockey, followed by football and girls’ lacrosse.    The most common symptoms to look for were headache, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and sensitivity to light or noise.    Most of these symptoms were gone within two weeks, but almost one in four athletes required more than 28 days to return to play.    “I think the most interesting finding is not related with the data itself, but rather the comparisons that can be made with other concussion surveillance research,” Kerr said.   “There is typically the assumption that higher level of competition yields a higher level of intensity, which may be associated with a greater risk of injury,” he said. “However, we found high school sports in which concussion rates were higher than those reported at the collegiate level . . . in certain sports and settings, such as football and boys’ soccer.    “We as the public need to use research findings to help push for concussion prevention strategies that will benefit our young athletes,” Kerr said.     “These can range from programs that push for better tackling and blocking strategies or policy that reduces or restricts potential contact among players,” he said. “The research should serve as a starting point to engage in a dialogue on how to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of our athletes.”   "
2pxNuMW,2017-04-19,Berkeley soda tax takes a big gulp out of sugary-drink sales," (Reuters Health) - The nation’s first soda tax is fulfilling health experts’ goals in Berkeley, California.   Sales of sugar-sweetened beverages dropped nearly 10 percent during the first year of the tax, which raised $1.4 million for child nutrition and community health programs, a new study showed.    “I’m calling it a home run,” lead author Dr. Lynn D. Silver, a senior advisor at the Public Health Institute in Oakland, said of the measure.   She ticked off the accomplishments of the penny-per-ounce tax in a phone interview. After it took effect in March 2015, residents drank less sugary drinks and more water, milk and other healthier beverages; average consumer grocery bills did not rise, despite soda company warnings; local store revenue did not, as tax opponents predicted, fall; and the tax raised money for health-education programs.   Berkeley voters levied the tax on soda and other sugary drinks to try to curb consumption and stem the epidemics of obesity and diabetes. Similar taxes have been levied around the globe - from Mexico to Colombia, France and South Africa.    Last year, other U.S. municipalities - including Philadelphia, San Francisco, Oakland and Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago - approved laws to tax sugary beverages.   The new study, reported in PLoS Medicine, evaluated changes in beverage sales in Berkeley during the tax’s first year. Sugar-sweetened drink sales fell 9.6 percent compared to predicted sales without the tax, while sales of untaxed beverages, like water and milk, rose 3.5 percent.   “The findings suggest that sugary-drink taxes make health and economic sense,” Silver said.   Proponents of soda taxes hailed the study as evidence of their effectiveness.   Michael F. Jacobson, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington, D.C., called the tax “a huge public-health victory.” He urged policymakers and voters in cities and counties without soda taxes to review the study and press for similar measures.    “This study won’t stop Big Soda from claiming that taxes don’t work,” said Jacobson, who was not involved with the research. “But if soda taxes didn’t make a significant dent in soda consumption, the industry wouldn’t be fighting taxes so hard.”   The American Beverage Association, which represents Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, said in a statement that the new “study acknowledges that taxes do not demonstrate a meaningful reduction in obesity rates.”   Silver called the trade group’s statement “simply false.” Her study did not attempt to judge the tax’s impact on obesity and diabetes rates.   “The soda tax did what it set out to do, which was to lower the sales of sugar-sweetened beverages and to increase consumption of healthier beverages,” she said.    “Our current obesity and diabetes rates are the result of decades of intensive marketing and growing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and other unhealthy foods,” she said. “It is far too soon to assess the impact of the tax on obesity and diabetes rates.”   Silver said that when she was training to become a pediatrician in the 1980s, she never saw a child with type 2 diabetes, which used to be called adult-onset diabetes. Today, she regularly sees children with type 2 diabetes.   She has watched mothers in clinic waiting rooms feeding their toddlers baby bottles filled with soda, she added.   Nancy Brown, CEO of the American Heart Association, said the study confirmed evidence from previous studies of the benefits of soda taxes, and she urged the beverage industry to embrace the taxes.   “Spending millions to fight local citizens working tirelessly to improve their community puts the beverage industry on the wrong side of health and history,” Brown, who was not involved with the study, said in a statement.   The American Beverage Association downplayed the significance of the new study, saying the unique demographic profile of the Northern California city of Berkeley makes it a “challenging place to determine the true impact of a beverage tax.”   Berkeley residents do tend to be higher income, better educated and drink less soda than residents of most other American cities. But Silver pointed out that her study’s findings mirrored those of another recent study of a soda tax in Mexico.   “In fact,” she said, “we saw an even greater decline in sugary-drink sales in Berkeley in the first year, in spite of Berkeley’s relative prosperity.”   Mexicans cut their purchases of soda and other sugar-sweetened beverages by 5.5 percent the first year that a tax was imposed and by nearly 10 percent in the second year, the previous study showed.   Reuters reported elsewhere today that sales of soda drinks in the U.S. fell in 2016 for the 12th year in a row, “as demand was hit by consumers choosing healthier options and a slew of sugar taxes aimed at stemming obesity and diabetes took effect.”  "
2pCJSGG,2017-04-19,Do patients and doctors understand breast cancer genetic testing results?," (Reuters Health) - If you have early-stage breast cancer and have undergone genetic testing, the odds are high that the results were not explained to you by a genetic counselor, and chances are, the results did not affect your surgeon’s recommendations for treatment, according to a recent U.S. study.   “Women should ask their clinicians to refer them to a genetic counselor to discuss their genetic testing results,” lead author Dr. Allison W. Kurian from Stanford University School of Medicine in California told Reuters Health. “Results of genetic testing are increasingly complex and difficult for those without genetics expertise to interpret correctly,” she said by email.   The added complexity is in part because more genes are being tested, which is good in that it increases the chance of finding a useful result, Kurian said. But it also increases the chance of finding an ambiguous “variant of uncertain significance (VUS),” she said.    Inherited mutations, sometimes called germline mutations, in the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 are probably the best known as influencing a woman’s risk of breast and ovarian cancer. But these and other less well-studied inherited mutations can also influence her risk of cancer recurring or of a new cancer in the future, so they may indicate a need for different approaches to treatment.    Expert guidelines increasingly call for genetic testing to identify the presence of inherited mutations, particularly for women already diagnosed with breast cancer, the study team writes in Journal of Clinical Oncology. But it’s not clear if patients or their doctors are using the results to make informed treatment choices.    The researchers used information from two large registries, along with surveys of patients with early-stage breast cancer who had genetic testing and surveys of their surgeons, to examine patterns of genetic testing and counseling and the impact of test results on surgical decisions.    Out of 666 women who reported genetic testing, two-thirds were tested before they had surgery. Nearly three quarters of tested women had no mutation in BRCA1/BRCA2, while 7 percent did have a mutation in BRCA1/BRCA2 or another gene associated with breast cancer risk. Another 9 percent had a variant of uncertain significance.       Even though genetic counseling is recommended before genetic testing, only about 1 in 5 of the tests was ordered by a genetic counselor. Surgeons ordered the tests nearly half of the time and medical cancer specialists (oncologists) ordered about a third of the tests.   The researchers also divided women into high and average risk groups based on family history and other breast cancer risk factors to understand other possible influences on testing and treatment choices.   About half of women tested (57 percent of those at high risk of mutation based on other factors and 42 percent of those at average risk) discussed their results with genetic counselors. About 1 in 5 discussed their results only with their surgeons, and 17 percent in the higher risk group as well as 31 percent of those at average risk discussed their results only with their oncologists.    Higher-risk women were more likely to have bilateral mastectomy if testing found a high-risk mutation (80 percent), but many women underwent bilateral mastectomy even if they had a VUS (43 percent) or no mutation at all (34 percent). Bilateral mastectomy choices were similar among average-risk women.    Up to a third of surgeons rarely referred patients for genetic counseling and many surgeons said they never delayed surgery while waiting for genetic testing results.    Fewer than half of the surgeons surveyed said that they offered breast-conserving therapy to any women with mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2.    Half of the surgeons who treated a lower volume of breast cancer patients and one quarter of the surgeons with a higher volume of cases reported managing patients with VUS in the BRCA1/BRCA2 genes the same way as they managed patients with the well-established harmful mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2.    “This is concerning because practice guidelines explicitly state that VUS should not be treated in the same way as harmful mutations,” Kurian said. “In particular, the finding raises concern that misunderstanding of VUS (believing that they cause high cancer risk when they do not) may be responsible for unnecessary bilateral mastectomies,” she noted.    “It’s increasingly important that genetic tests be ordered and interpreted by genetic counseling experts,” she said.   "
2oJgxvQ,2017-04-18,Program identifies risky diabetic drivers and helps them improve," (Reuters Health) - A short questionnaire can identify drivers with type 1 diabetes who are at high risk of future driving mishaps, and an online intervention can help them avoid these mishaps, according to a U.S. study.   “Like pilots who have to go through a pre-flight checklist to ensure all systems are a go, drivers with diabetes should go through a check list, asking themselves whether they have had more physical activity, taken more insulin, eaten fewer carbohydrates than usual, feel any unusual symptoms and judge whether they are low or likely to go low during the drive,” said lead author Dr. Daniel Cox from the University of Virginia Health System and Virginia Driving Safety Laboratory in Charlottesville.    “If the answer is yes, then they should take appropriate steps to avoid hypoglycemia while driving,” Cox said by email.    Drivers with type 1 diabetes have a greater risk of collisions than their spouses without diabetes, and those mishaps correspond to the use of insulin pumps, a history of collisions, severe low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and previous hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps, the study team writes in Diabetes Care.   The researchers developed an 11-item questionnaire to screen drivers with type 1 diabetes for a high risk of driving mishaps and developed an online intervention intended to help high-risk individuals avoid future mishaps.    Their Risk Assessment of Diabetic Drivers (RADD) scale included questions about past experiences while driving, like “have you had an automobile accident or received a moving vehicle violation in the last 2 years?” and diabetes-specific questions like, “have you had low blood glucose in the past 6 months?” and “was it a hassle trying to hide dizziness or other symptoms of low blood glucose?”    Based on answers to 11 questions, around 35 percent of individuals with type 1 diabetes could be classified as high-risk drivers whose mishap rate was nearly three times higher than that of people in the low-risk group.   High-risk drivers who went on to participate in the online intervention at DiabetesDriving.com had a driving mishap rate of about 2.5 per year in the following 12 months, compared with about 4.25 mishaps per year among high-risk drivers who did not participate in the intervention. Still, the mishap rate of high-risk drivers who did the intervention remained higher than that of low-risk drivers.   “Driving is a privilege, not a right,” Cox said. “Whether we have type 1 diabetes, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, slowed reaction times due to aging, or some other chronic or acute condition (e.g., excessive sleepiness or intoxication), we all have a responsibility to ourselves, our families, and others on the road to ensure we are a safe driver.”    People with diabetes should realize they should never drive when their blood glucose is below 70, because it is too easy to slip from mild hypoglycemia to moderate hypoglycemia that impairs judgment, information processing speed, and general reaction time, Cox added. “As soon as hypoglycemia is detected or suspected, the driver should immediately safely pull off the road, treat it, and not resume driving until the hypoglycemia resolves.”    “Diabetic patients have a tendency not to disclose their driving mishaps or near miss events due to fear of losing their driving licenses,” said Dr. Thinzar Min from Swansea University in the UK, who was not involved in the study.   In the UK, drivers are allowed only one severe hypoglycemic episode in 12 months to retain Group 1 license (cars and motorcycles) and no severe hypoglycemic episodes for Group 2 licenses (trucks and busses), Min noted.    “I think the RADD scale would be more accurate if the patients can use it to assess themselves if they are high-risk or not,” she said. “Online interventions should be aimed at all diabetic patients who are taking insulin.”    Dr. Eitaro Nakashima from Chubu Rosai Hospitalin Nagoya, Japan, wrote recently about the pitfalls of tightening driving regulations for diabetic patients in Japan and Europe. “In my opinion, each patient should understand the degree of risk of driving mishaps and prepare sugar in their car. For general public, education and individual customized treatment are important for good outcome instead of tightening of driving regulations,” he told Reuters Health by email.  "
2p9NWOr,2017-04-18,Should pregnant mothers hang up their cell phones?," (Reuters Health) - Children whose mothers were frequent cell phone users during pregnancy were more likely than those of less frequent users to be hyperactive, a new study finds.   But lead author Laura Birks is not advising expectant mothers to hang up their cell phones.   She cautioned that she could not say if electromagnetic radiation from cell phones or any number of other factors, such as parenting styles, might explain the link between maternal cell phone use during pregnancy and childhood behavioral problems.   “I would say interpret these results with caution, and everything in moderation,” she said in a Skype interview.    Birks and her colleagues analyzed data on more than 80,000 mother-child pairs in Denmark, Spain, Norway, the Netherlands and Korea. They found consistent evidence of increasing risk of behavioral problems - particularly, hyperactivity - in 5- to 7-year-old children the more their mothers talked on cell phones during pregnancy.    Given that there is no known biological mechanism that could lead prenatally emitted cell phone radiation to promote hyperactivity in offspring, the results were surprising, said Birks, who is a doctoral student in biomedicine at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain.    The association held firm across five countries and time periods.   Offspring of mothers who reported being on at least four cell phone calls a day, or in one cohort speaking on a cell phone for more than an hour a day, were 28 percent more likely to be hyperactive than offspring of mothers who reported being on one or fewer calls a day, researchers found after accounting for a variety of confounding variables, such as maternal age, marital status and education.    The data spanned a variety of time periods from 1996 through 2011. Only the earliest cohort, in Denmark starting in 1996, had enough women who never used a cell phone while pregnant to study women who did not use cell phones during pregnancy.   But the children of mothers who never used cell phones while pregnant had a lower risk of behavioral and emotional problems than any of the children whose mothers used cell phones, according to the report in Environment International.    Dr. Robin Hansen, a pediatrician and professor at the University of California, Davis in Sacramento found the report raised more questions than it answered.   “Is it something about the cellphone itself?” she asked in a phone interview. “Is it something that impacts your parenting behavior? Those are issues that can’t be answered by this study.”   As a pediatrician who works with children who have behavioral problems, Hansen is less inclined to consider cellphone radiation and more inclined to consider parenting styles, habits and personalities as a possible link between maternal cellphone use and childhood hyperactivity, she said. She was not involved in the study.   “Now we have to dig deeper and figure out why,” Hansen said. “Is it the electronic signals that go through your brain and your body, or how it changes your interactions with your child postnatally?”   American pediatricians advise parents to limit their children’s screen time. But parents also need to consider how their time spent tethered to their phones takes them away from their children, Hansen said.   When parents stare at their phones and fail to respond to their kids, their children quickly learn how to get the attention they crave, she said.    “It’s not until you cry or you throw something or make a lot of noise, that your parents shift their attention from the cellphone to you,” she said.

2oPCmdI,2017-04-17,Mentally ill accessing less U.S. health care," (Reuters Health) - More than 8 million American adults suffer from serious psychological distress, and they’re less likely to access healthcare services than other people, a U.S. study suggests.    People with serious psychological distress, which includes any mental illness severe enough to require treatment, are three times more likely to be too poor to afford care and 10 times more likely to be unable to pay for medications, the study found.    “Adults with serious psychological distress are more likely to experience delays in healthcare, insufficient money for needed healthcare, change their place of health care, and change their place of healthcare due to insurance,” said lead study author Judith Weissman of New York University Langone Medical Center.   “They are also more likely to have limitations in ability to work, and in activities of daily living compared to adults without serious psychological distress,” Weissman said by email.    For the study, researchers examined survey data on health care use from 2006 to 2014 for a nationwide sample of 207,853 U.S. adults ages 18 to 64. About two-thirds of participants were white and almost one-third had at least a college education.    To assess how many people had serious psychological distress, researchers focused on questions that examined how often participants experienced feelings like exhaustion, hopelessness, nervousness, restlessness, sadness and worthlessness.   Overall, about 3.4 percent of adults, representing more than 8.3 million people, reported serious psychological distress in 2014, up from roughly 3 percent at the start of the study, researchers report in the journal Psychiatric Services.    By the end of the study, 9.9 percent of adults with serious psychological distress couldn’t afford to see a mental health care provider, up from 8.7 percent in 2006, the study found.    The pattern was reversed for adults without these mental illnesses; 8 percent couldn’t afford to see a mental health care provider in 2014, down from 10.7 percent at the start of the study.    Over that same time, the proportion of mentally ill adults who couldn’t pay for drugs climbed from 8.7 percent to 9.9 percent. For people without serious psychological distress, the proportion of adults unable to afford medications dropped from 10.7 percent to 8 percent.    Access and affordability appear to have worsened for people with serious psychological distress despite two U.S. laws designed to do the opposite: the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare, the researchers note.    One limitation of the study is that researchers only had one year of data under the ACA, which might not fully account for changes in access or affordability in subsequent years, the authors note. Researchers lacked data to examine how different states’ approaches to expanding Medicaid coverage through the ACA might influence whether mentally ill adults could get needed care.    “There is overwhelming evidence that untreated mental illness impacts people’s jobs and performance in school, which in turn influence their ability to access health care,” said Dr. Joseph Puyat of the Center for Health Evaluation and Outcome Sciences at the University of British Columbia.   “Even when access is provided for by publicly-funded insurance coverage, people with untreated mental illness face challenges adhering to their treatment,” Puyat, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   At the same time, dealing with the complexities of the U.S. health care system can prove daunting for people with mental illness, said Benjamin Cook, director of the Health Equity Research Lab at Cambridge Health Alliance and a researcher at Harvard Medical School.     “Some with symptoms of depression have a very difficult time mustering up the energy to leave the house, so you can imagine how difficult it is to generate the motivation to understand and navigate the complicated healthcare system,” Cook, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “For others, seeking medical care raises anxiety and exacerbates symptoms.”  "
2oF6436,2017-04-17,Pregnant teens more likely to smoke pot than other girls," (Reuters Health) - Adolescent girls are more than twice as likely to smoke marijuana if they’re pregnant, a U.S. study suggests.    While previous research has tied teen drug and alcohol use to higher odds of multiple sex partners and pregnancy, the current study offers fresh insight into marijuana use among young women.    About 14 percent of pregnant girls ages 12 to 17 smoke marijuana, compared to roughly 6 percent of their non-pregnant peers, the study found. By contrast, older pregnant women were at least half as likely to smoke pot as their peers.   Among all pregnant women ages 12 to 44 in the study, about 6 percent reported marijuana use during the first trimester, while 3 percent said they smoked pot in the second trimester and about 2 percent use the drug in the third and final trimester.    “These findings should be considered in a broader context in which young people increasingly view marijuana not just as a benign, but even as a beneficial drug,” said lead study author Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Bethesda, Maryland.   “The higher prevalence of marijuana use observed in the first trimester as opposed to later in the pregnancy, suggests that some women are likely to resort to marijuana for managing their nausea,” Volkow added by email.    Doctors advise women to completely avoid marijuana during pregnancy because it may have negative effects on fetal neurodevelopment, especially during the first trimester.    For the study, researchers examined survey data on marijuana use reported by 410,000 women aged 12 to 44, including 14,400 who were pregnant. The national survey data was collected from 2002 to 2015.    Overall, about 4 percent of pregnant women and almost 8 percent of non-pregnant women reported using marijuana, researchers report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.    In both pregnant and non-pregnant groups, women who were at least 26 years old were less likely to use marijuana than younger women.    Among pregnant women, black women were more likely to report marijuana use than other racial and ethnic groups.    One limitation of the study is that it relied on women to accurately report their drug use, which may mean the results underestimate how much people use it, the authors note.    Even so, the findings are a reminder that despite declining teen pregnancy rates, parents and doctors should still keep in mind that these young women may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors than their peers, said Patricia Cavazos-Rehg of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.    “We have known for some time that certain groups of adolescents are prone to deviant behaviors, but we need to know more about the unique environmental and/or biological vulnerability factors that influence the tendency for risk behavior engagement at the outset,” Cavazos-Rehg, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    The trouble with pot smoking for pregnant teens is it may be even more dangerous for them than for older women, said Dr. Nathaniel DeNicola of George Washington University in Washington, D.C.   “Drug use, and marijuana use specifically, is underreported by all age groups, and there is reason to think this is higher among teens,” DeNicola, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.     “But the bigger issue: marijuana use is different among teens - it’s more dangerous,” DeNicola added. “There are more adverse and consequential impacts on the still-developing brain.”   For some teens, just telling about the risk of pot during pregnancy may be enough to get them to stop, noted Dr. Seth Ammerman of Stanford University and Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in California.   “Some of these adolescents who are using do not initially realize they are pregnant, but once they find out and are counseled to stop use, a significant number do, so rates decrease from the first trimester on,” Ammerman, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

2oHjzBn,2017-04-14,Pedometers tied to less fatigue for rheumatoid arthritis patients," (Reuters Health) - Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who receive pedometers may be more active and feel less fatigued even if they are not told to use the trackers to aim for a specific number of steps, a small study suggests.    All 96 study participants had rheumatoid arthritis, an immune system disorder that causes debilitating swelling and pain in the joints. Researchers randomly assigned patients to get a pedometer with or without a daily step goal, or to get only educational brochures with advice on becoming more active.    After 21 weeks, all of people with pedometers were walking more on average each day: 1,441 additional steps without a step goal and 1,656 extra steps with a goal. But the patients who didn’t get pedometers actually got 747 fewer steps a day on average by the end of the study.    Patients with pedometers reported statistically meaningful declines in fatigue during the study, but people who only got education did not.    “We found that increasing activity just through walking decreased fatigue,” said lead study author Dr. Patricia Katz of the University of California, San Francisco.    “Most of us probably don’t realize how inactive we are until we start measuring our daily activity,” Katz said by email. “Having a concrete goal, such as the number of daily steps, seems to help people become and stay active.”   Every patient received the same educational brochure at the start. In the two groups that received pedometers, all of the participants were asked to keep a daily diary to record how many steps they logged.    For one group with pedometers, researchers also assessed their activity levels at the start of the study and set goals for them to increase their average daily steps by 10 percent every two weeks.    At the start of the study, participants were 54 years old on average and were typically getting about 4,891 steps a day, which researchers classified as sedentary. Very few of them were getting at least 8,000 steps a day, which the researchers say is a healthy activity level.   Beyond its small size, another limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on how often participants wore the devices, which makes it difficult to get an accurate daily step count, the authors note in Arthritis Care and Research.    It’s also possible that the pedometer groups might not have improved as much if they hadn’t also been recording their steps in a daily diary, which increases their engagement with the effort to be more active, said Dr. Mitesh Patel, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Research indicates that for most people, pedometers and wearable devices are more likely to help change health behaviors if they are combined with an engagement strategy,” Patel said by email.    Generally, pedometers are most useful for people who are sedentary and unaware of their own level of inactivity, said Dr. Lucas Carr, a physiology researcher at the University of Iowa who wasn’t involved in the study.    “This relatively simple intervention helped a very sedentary group of rheumatoid arthritis patients increase their activity at a level that is considered clinically significant,” Carr said by email. “The largest health benefits are realized when an individual changes from doing nothing to doing something.”   While the study included only people with rheumatoid arthritis, it’s possible pedometers might be useful for people with other chronic medical problems, said Dr. David Geier, an orthopedic surgeon sports medicine specialist in Charleston, South Carolina who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It seems reasonable to think they could help stimulate activity,” Geier said by email. “Physical activity would be helpful for almost everyone.”  "
2oceBJu,2017-04-14,Black U.S. babies still more likely to die than white infants," (Reuters Health) - Even as infant mortality rates are declining nationwide, there are some U.S. states where black babies are much more likely to die than white infants, a recent study suggests.    Overall, infant mortality rates decreased 13 percent in the U.S. from 2000 to 2013, the study found. By the end of this period, however, the black infant mortality rate was 11.1 deaths for every 1,000 live births, compared with just 5.1 deaths for every 1,000 white newborns. The rate is calculated based on the number of babies who die before their first birthday.    Eliminating this gap would have saved almost 65,000 black babies during the study period, the researchers estimate in the American Journal of Public Health.    “I’d like to see racial equality in infant survival in my lifetime, and some states are on the right track,” lead study author Dr. Joedrecka Brown Speights of Florida State University College of Medicine in Tallahassee said by email.    For the study, researchers used government records to calculate infant mortality rates in 35 states; some states had too few deaths to analyze meaningful differences between the groups of babies.    By the end of the study, state-level black infant mortality rates ranged from 6.65 to 13.77 deaths for every 1,000 live births.    All states improved infant mortality rates for black babies during the study period, though none achieved equality. The three states with the biggest improvements were Arizona, Iowa and Massachusetts, which reduced infant mortality by at least 30 percent during the study period.   Based on the rate of improvement in each state, researchers calculated that 18 states would achieve equal infant mortality rates for black and white babies by 2050.    Researchers also looked at how black babies fared relative to white infants and found wide variation among states.    Massachusetts reduced the racial gap in infant mortality by 24 percent during the study period, followed by Tennessee with a 23 percent reduction and Arizona with a 22 percent decline.    The gap widened in three states, expanding by less than 1 percent in New Jersey and Illinois and increasing almost 12 percent in Kansas.    The leading causes of black infant mortality for newborns are low birth weight, preterm deliveries, birth defects and pregnancy complications, researchers note in the American Journal of Public Health. Over the first year of life, the leading causes of death for black babies are birth defects, sudden infant death syndrome or accidental injuries.    One limitation of the study is that it didn’t include all states nationwide or assess how certain state policies might influence differences in infant mortality rates. Researchers also didn’t examine mortality rates for Hispanic babies or other racial and ethnic groups that make up a substantial proportion of the population in certain states.    “This is good news that the black-white gap in infant mortality is generally declining, and I think one contribution of the paper is simply to draw attention to the fact that the pace of improvement in the gap varies between states,” said Sam Harper, a public health researcher at McGill University in Montreal who wasn’t involved in the study.    “We should be interested in that variation, and understand why some states are doing better than others,” Harper said by email.    Women can do many things to make infant deaths less likely, including eating well, avoiding smoking, and getting good prenatal care during pregnancy, Harper said.    “That being said, it certainly helps to live in a community that provides access to high quality prenatal and post-natal care, affordable insurance, good doctors and nurses, and high-quality community resources,” Harper added. “Black women are less likely than white women to have access to all of these resources, and that is clearly a place where state health and social policies could make a difference.”  "
2pbYL5i,2017-04-14,Leaning forward during phone use may cause &#039;text neck&#039;," (Reuters Health) - Spine surgeons are noticing an increase in patients with neck and upper back pain, likely related to poor posture during prolonged smartphone use, according to a recent report.   Some patients, particularly young patients who shouldn’t yet have back and neck issues, are reporting disk hernias and alignment problems, the study authors write in The Spine Journal.   “In an X-ray, the neck typically curves backward, and what we’re seeing is that the curve is being reversed as people look down at their phones for hours each day,” said study coauthor Dr. Todd Lanman, a spinal neurosurgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.    “By the time patients get to me, they’re already in bad pain and have disc issues,” he told Reuters Health. “The real concern is that we don’t know what this means down the road for kids today who use phones all day.”   Lanman and co-author Dr. Jason Cuellar, an orthopedic spine surgeon at Cedars-Sinai, write that people often look down when using their smartphones, particularly when texting as compared to browsing online or watching videos. Previous studies have also found that people hold their necks at around 45 degrees, and it becomes even worse as they sit, versus standing, the study team writes.    The impact on the spine increases at higher flexed postures, they add. While in a neutral position looking forward, the head weighs about 10 to 12 pounds. At a 15-degree flex, it feels like 27 pounds. The stress on the spine increases by degree, and at 60 degrees, it’s 60 pounds.   “For today’s users, will an 8-year-old need surgery at age 28?” Lanman said. “In kids who have spines that are still growing and not developed, we’re not sure what to expect or if this could change normal anatomies,” he told Reuters Health.   Lanman and Cuellar suggest simple lifestyle changes to relieve the stress from the “text neck” posture. They recommend holding cell phones in front of the face, or near eye level, while texting. They also suggest using two hands and two thumbs to create a more symmetrical and comfortable position for the spine.    Beyond smartphone use, the spinal surgeons recommend that people who work at computers or on tablets use an elevated monitor stand so it sits at a natural horizontal eye level. With laptops, they recommend a similar adaptation by using a separate keyboard and mouse so the laptop can be at eye level and still create a good ergonomic position while typing.   “It is difficult to recommend a proper posture for smartphone users. If we raise the phone at eye level to avoid the look-down posture, it will add new concerns for the shoulder due to the elevated arm posture,” said Gwanseob Shin of the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology Ergonomics Lab in South Korea, who wasn’t involved with the study.    “A more practical recommendation would be frequent rest breaks or some physical exercise that can strengthen the neck and shoulder muscles,” Shin told Reuters Health by email. “Some apps can give alarming signals to users to avoid prolonged looking-down posture.”   Lanman recommends stretches and basic exercises that focus on posture as well. He tells patients to lie on their beds and hang their heads over the edge, extending the neck backward to restore the normal arc in the neck. While sitting, he recommends aligning the neck and spine by checking that the ears are over the shoulders and the shoulders are over the hips.    “Ask your friend to take a photo of your upper body when you’re texting, then use the picture as the background image on your phone,” Shin said. “That will remind you to take breaks frequently. Even a short break of a few seconds  - called a micro-break - can help our tissues recover.”  "
2oEsOlz,2017-04-13,Millions of Americans risk hearing loss from jobs and guns," (Reuters Health) - Many people are exposed to dangerously loud sounds at work and at play, and most of them don’t wear ear plugs or take other steps to prevent hearing loss, a recent U.S. study suggests.   Almost 49 million adults work in very noisy conditions, and more than one-third of them never use hearing protection, the study found. Among leisure pursuits, firearms pose a particular risk and just 59 percent of the 35 million U.S. gun users represented in the study wear hearing protection all the time.    “The problem here is both the number of people using firearms and the potential noise-inducing hearing loss from the repeated gunfire,” said senior study author Dr. Neil Bhattacharyya of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.   “A rifle has an extremely loud single burst of sound and if you are firing hundreds of rounds, that can be very damaging, particularly without hearing protection,” Bhattacharyya said by email.    To assess how often U.S. adults are exposed to loud noise and how regularly they take steps to protect against hearing loss, researchers examined 2014 survey data representing 240 million people.    Overall, 22 percent were exposed to “very loud” sounds at work requiring them to shout to be heard at arm’s length. The exposures were for at least four hours a day, several days a week.   Roughly one in five people were exposed to loud sounds outside of work, and 62 percent of them didn’t use hearing protection, researchers report in The Laryngoscope.   With firearms, researchers found that one in five people who shot more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition in the past year never used hearing protection. Most of the firearm-related noise exposure came during recreational shooting.    Lawn mowers were the most common source of non-occupational noise exposure.    Almost two-thirds of people around loud noises during recreational activities never used any hearing protection.    One limitation of the study is that it only included one year of survey data, the authors note. It also didn’t have medical records to document specific hearing or health problems associated with noise.   “Untreated hearing loss is associated with increased stress, depression and social withdrawal, and may exacerbate problems for those with cognitive changes such as dementia,” said Dr. Jennifer Derebery of the House Ear Clinic and Institute and the University of California Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine.   If people aren’t sure whether the noise around them is loud enough to damage their ears, they can get a sound meter app for their phone and use ear plugs or other protection whenever the app shows the sound is too loud, Derebery, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    And there are good options for people to wear when they still need to hear the sounds around them, a concern for many hunters and concert goers.    “There are outstanding electronic ear muff and ear plug options that solve many of the complaints that recreational shooters and hunters have related to conventional hearing protection,” said Colleen Le Prell, an audiology researcher at the University of Texas at Dallas who wasn’t involved in the study.    “They allow quiet sounds, such as speech and sounds the hunter might be making as they walk, to be not only delivered but amplified, which can be very useful with someone who already has some hearing loss,” Le Prell said by email. “Hearing loss can be prevented, with the consistent and correct use of hearing protection devices.”  "
2ovflMy,2017-04-13,"As people age, the factors that drive depression may shift"," (Reuters Health) – Different types of problems are most likely to afflict people at different times of life, so common risk factors for depression change over the years, too, Dutch researchers say.                    A young carer holds the hands of an elderly woman in a residential home for the elderly in Planegg near Munich in this June 19, 2007 file photo.Michaela Rehle/Files       But when a risk factor is uncommon among peers – like widowhood or poor health in youth – it can have an outsized effect on depression risk, the study team reports in The American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry.   “A wide range of risk factors for depression is relevant across the entire life span,” said lead author Roxanne Schaakxs of VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam.   “However, some risk factors expected to be strongly related to depression in certain ages, may actually affect other age groups to a larger extent,” Schaakxs added by email.   Depression is a complex condition and many experts believe that in addition to innate genetic and personality factors, risks like stressful life events, health issues and money problems can contribute to its development, the study team notes.   To see which depression risk factors affect people at various stages of life, and how much of an effect each factor has, the study team analyzed data on more than 2,000 adults participating in two long-term studies of depression and anxiety. Subjects in one study were aged 18 to 65 when they began participating, while participants in the other study were aged 60 to 93 when it started.   At baseline, a total of 1,431 people had major depressive disorder and 784 people had no symptoms or history of the condition.   The research team assessed 19 different risk factors for depression in different age groups, comparing people who had never been depressed with people who were currently depressed.   Most of the risk factors did increase people’s likelihood of being depressed at any age, including low education, recent negative life events, personality traits, reduced social functioning, an unhealthy lifestyle and poor health.    However, five of the risk factors were more strongly related to depression in certain age groups.    For people aged 18 to 39, health factors like overweight or obesity, pain, childhood abuse and chronic disease were strongly associated with depression. For those over 60, low income was a greater risk for depression than in other age groups.    People with risk factors that were “unexpected” based on their age also had a higher depression risk than those in other age groups where the same risk factor was more common, researchers found.    For example, chronic illness was more strongly linked to depression in younger people than older people while low income carried higher depression risk in older people though it was more common among younger people.   When young people are struggling with circumstances like illness or loneliness, it may come as a surprise and they may not have the skills to cope, said Patricia Arean, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.   She stressed the importance of screening young people with chronic illnesses for depression. “Fortunately, prevention interventions for depression are also good for health care: get good sleep, rest, exercise regularly, reach out to friends and family,” said Arean, who was not involved in the current study.    “When an unexpected life event happens, pay close attention to your reaction to it,” Arean said by email. “If you find that you are struggling with your mood, energy, interest in things, concentration for more than two weeks, Do Not Ignore those symptoms. Go see your doctor and get help.”   “General practitioners and therapists should not overlook risk factors for depression by assuming the risk factor is less relevant at a certain age,” Schaakxs advised.  "
2p8XNEo,2017-04-13,Weight loss surgery raises odds of abdominal surgery during pregnancy," (Reuters Health) - Women who have had bariatric surgery are six times more likely to need abdominal surgery during pregnancy compared to obese pregnant women who haven’t had a prior weight loss surgery, a recent study in Sweden suggests.    The most common reason for the abdominal surgeries was intestinal obstruction, a complication that affects 2 percent of all Swedish bariatric surgery patients, the authors note in Obstetrics and Gynecology.    Past research has found that bariatric surgery, such as gastric bypass, gastric banding and gastroplasty, is associated with increased risks during pregnancy of premature labor, cesarean delivery and delivering a baby that is small for gestational age.    Women may want to weigh the added risk of needing abdominal surgery during pregnancy when considering whether to wait until they have finished childbearing before having bariatric surgery, the study team writes.   Lead author Dr. Andrea Stuart, who specializes in obstetrics and gynecology at Central Hospital in Helsingborg, Sweden, told Reuters Health that she noticed some pregnant patients with previous gastric bypass surgery had clinical problems.   “They often presented with abdominal pain, and as intestinal obstruction could not be ruled out, they underwent abdominal surgery with a premature cesarean section,” Stuart said by email.   Stuart and a colleague decided to study how bariatric surgery affected the risk of abdominal surgery during pregnancy by analyzing data from the Swedish National Patient Registry and the Swedish Medical Birth Registry for 1987 through 2011.    The researchers identified about 2,500 women who had undergone weight loss surgeries, usually gastric bypass, before giving birth, including about 1,200 first-time pregnancies, and compared them to more than 21,000 women who had a body mass index (BMI) in the obese range at the beginning of their pregnancies but no history of bariatric surgery.    The study team found that about 1.5 percent of pregnant women with a history of bariatric surgery also had abdominal surgery during their pregnancy due to intestinal obstruction, compared to 0.02 percent of women who did not have bariatric surgery.    Intestinal obstruction during pregnancy is potentially life-threatening for the mother and about 17 percent of fetuses die as a result, the study team writes. Pregnancy may increase the risk because of the extra pressure and organ displacement caused by the enlarged uterus.    An additional 1.5 percent of the pregnant women with prior bariatric surgery underwent surgical diagnostic procedures without finding any diagnosis, compared to 0.1 percent of pregnant women without prior bariatric surgery.    Many factors influence whether or not obese women should have bariatric surgery first or after childbearing, so there is no black or white answer, Stuart said. “The factors include, the age of the women, duration of infertility, previous pregnancies, previous abdominal surgery, etc.”    However, it’s important to note that obesity also raises risk factors for various problems during pregnancy. “The maternal complications include gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and a higher risk of cesarean section,” Stuart said.   The fetal complications are, fetal miscarriage, malformations, high birth weight, cerebral palsy, asphyxia and death, she added.  "
2nIL4Lg,2017-04-13,Kids more likely to stop bullies when parents tell them to," (Reuters Health) - Kids are more likely to step in when they see bullying at school if their parents have told them to get involved than if they’ve been taught it’s better to stay out of it, a recent U.S. study suggests.    About one in 10 children are victims of bullying, and many anti-bullying programs are focused on getting bystanders to intervene, researchers note in the Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. While previous research has linked certain parenting practices to higher odds that kids will be victims or perpetrators of bullying, less is known about how parents impact what children do as bystanders.   For the current study, researchers surveyed 1,440 fourth and fifth grade students about how their classmates behaved in bullying situations and also did home interviews to see how parents told kids to respond to hypothetical incidents.   In school, kids whose classmates said they might intervene to stop bullies and to comfort victims were more likely to have parents at home who told them getting involved was the right thing to do, the study found. At the same time, kids whose parents told them to stay out of it were both less likely to help victims and more likely to become perpetrators.    “We were surprised to find that when parents told children not to get involved, children were actually more likely to join in the bullying,” said lead study author Stevie Grassetti, a psychology researcher at the University of Delaware.    The study didn’t explore why parents’ advice to steer clear of bullying translated into encouraging or participating in this behavior.   “It could be that when parents told children to stay out of it, children perceived this advice to indicate a lack of empathy for victims and, in turn joined in bullying because they believed doing so really was not very bad,” Grassetti said by email.    “Alternately, it could be that children believed that they were following their parents advice to stay out of bullying because they did not realize that watching, laughing or cheering a bully on during a bullying situation is actually reinforcing the bully and making bullying worse,” Grassetti added.    Kids in the study were around 11 years old on average.    During home visits in the study, pairs of caregivers and children were presented with five hypothetical bullying examples, and then parents were asked to explain to their children how they should respond if they witnessed the situation take place.   Based on the study results, it makes sense for school anti-bullying efforts to involve parents and endeavor to give children consistent messages about prevention in both settings, the authors conclude.    One limitation of the study is that during school visits, researchers didn’t define what constitutes bullying the authors note. With home visits, researchers assumed parents gave kids the same advice about the hypothetical incidents that they would offer in real life, which might not always be the case, the researchers also point out.    “Parents can talk with their kids about what experiences they may face in each of these roles of bystander, target and perpetrator, and help the child understand how the role may feel,” said Dr. Megan Moreno of Seattle Children’s Research Institute.    “Parents can ask their kids to consider possible actions if they are a bystander, or a target, or if they are provided with the opportunity to be a perpetrator,” Moreno, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “This gives the child a way to think through their options ahead of time, and practice things to say or do with a parent when they are not in the heat of the moment of the actual situation at school,” she said.

2nXUdPW,2017-04-12,More evidence ties insulin resistance to cognitive decline," (Reuters Health) – - Having reduced sensitivity to insulin may lead to more rapid decline in memory and other mental skills in old age even among people who don’t have diabetes, a recent study suggests.    So-called insulin resistance, the body’s failure to respond normally to the hormone insulin, is a hallmark of diabetes. Diabetes itself – a disease in which the body can’t properly use insulin to convert blood sugar into energy - has been linked to cognitive decline and dementia, but the exact nature of the connection isn’t as clear.   In the current study, researchers followed 489 older adults for more than two decades. They found people with the highest levels of insulin resistance had the worst cognitive performance and the lowest scores on tests of memory and a mental skill known as executive function.    “There is growing evidence that insulin carries out multiple functions in the brain and thus poor regulation of insulin may contribute to accelerated cognitive decline and potentially to Alzheimer’s disease,” said senior study author David Tanne of Tel Aviv University in Israel.   “It is not just people with Type 2 diabetes,” Tanne said by email. “Even people with mild or moderate insulin resistance who don’t have Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk over time.”   At the start of the study, patients were 58 years old on average and all of them had cardiovascular disease. People were left out of the analysis if they had diabetes at the beginning of the study or if they developed the condition during the follow-up period.    Researchers did cognitive assessments once when participants were around 72 years old and again when they were about 77.    Cognitive functions were assessed with a computerized battery of tests that examined memory, executive function, visual spatial processing and attention.    When researchers accounted for cardiovascular risk factors, they still found higher levels of insulin resistance were associated with greater cognitive decline. The association held up even when researchers excluded people with a history of stroke, dementia or diabetes.    One limitation of the study is that most participants were men, and the results might be different in women, researchers note in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease. A substantial proportion of participants didn’t remain in the study through the second cognitive assessment, potentially leaving only healthier individuals for the final analysis.    The study also wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that insulin resistance directly causes cognitive decline.   One leading theory about insulin resistance is that the high levels of blood sugar that it can cause have a negative impact on blood vessels in the brain, which increases the risk for dementia, said Barbara Bendlin, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. Some studies suggest that high levels of blood insulin also have a negative effect on the brain, even independently of high blood sugar, she added.    “Insulin is involved in helping brain cells form connections, so it plays a direct role in helping us form memories,” Bendlin, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Some studies suggest that abnormally high levels of blood insulin may actually cause there to be less insulin in the brain, due to changes in how insulin is transported into the brain.”   Because the exact reasons for the connection between insulin resistance and cognitive decline are unclear, it’s difficult to give patients specific medical advice based on the study results, said Fernanda De Felice, a neurobiology researcher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil who wasn’t involved in the study.    “However, there are some studies indicating that exercise and healthy diet may prevent insulin resistance in the brain,” De Felice said by email. “Having proper sleep and avoiding stress also helps.”  "
2oNbKKx,2017-04-12,Heart attack deaths rise when a large marathon is in town," (Reuters Health) - - Being in a town where a major marathon is being run can pose a life-and-death hazard, researchers say.                    Runners participate in the annual Chicago Marathon October 10, 2010. REUTERS/John Gress      A new study of cities hosting the largest U.S. marathons has found that the odds of dying if you have a heart attack or cardiac arrest jump 13 percent the day the race is run.   The authors think that’s because blocked streets and traffic congestion add precious minutes to the time it takes for rescue units to get to the hospital.   On marathon days, it added more than four minutes in the 11 cities they studied. For people who drive themselves or have someone drive them, the delay is potentially much longer.   “The data are believable and the results important,” said Dr. Selim Suner of Brown University’s Alpert Medical School in Providence, Rhode Island, who was not involved in the research. “This will probably open the eyes of some of the planners for the events,” he told Reuters Health.   “Most people have not thought of this as unintended consequence of marathons and other public events,” said study coauthor Dr. Anupam Jena, an associate professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Discussions with officials in the cities revealed “a lot of variability in terms of their awareness of this being a potential issue,” he noted.   Jena and his colleagues looked at Medicare data from cities where marathons were run from 2002 through 2012, comparing death rates on the day of the race to rates in the five weeks before and the five weeks after. He and his team also compared rates in the host cities to those in surrounding zip codes that were unaffected by the race.   They found that the presence of the race in a city didn’t alter the number of cases of heart attack or cardiac arrest among people over age 64, but it did increase their rate of death within 30 days of the cardiac event from 24.9 percent when a marathon wasn’t being run to 28.2 percent when it was.   In addition, the rates of heart attack combined with cardiac arrest were twice as high among beneficiaries hospitalized on marathon dates as among similar beneficiaries hospitalized on non-marathon dates, “a finding that is consistent with delayed care,” the researchers write in the New England Journal of Medicine.   When they focused on ambulance transport times in the morning - when the races are usually run - they found that while it typically took 13.7 minutes to get to a hospital, the time increased to 18.1 minutes on marathon days. The number of miles driven was unaffected by a race.   “Several things could be done to address the problem,” Suner said. “Special routes could be preassigned for emergency medical services for different locations or planning could include rerouting to other hospitals.”   “The second issue here, which is more challenging to solve, is we found about 25 percent of people admitted with cardiac arrest or heart attack actually came in by themselves,” Jena told Reuters Health. “They were not brought in by ambulance, and those individuals probably experienced very large delays in transport time.”   One solution could be to advise the public that if you have chest pains or shortness of breath, or symptoms that are alarming, the best thing to do anytime or particularly on a marathon day is to call the EMS and not drive to the hospital yourself, he added.   In all, the researchers evaluated 1,145 hospitalizations on marathon dates and 11,074 on non-marathon dates in Boston, Chicago, Honolulu, Houston, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Orlando, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington, D.C. There were not enough data to see if the death rates were lower in some marathon cities than others.   The study team also tried to exclude marathon participants from their tally.   But Suner, who is director of the disaster medicine and emergency preparedness department at Brown, cautioned that the study doesn’t directly show cause and effect, and the researchers may have failed to account for other things that could make it look like the marathons produced extra deaths.    “For example: the authors did not look at daily temperature or ozone levels which may have been higher on marathon days accounting for increased death in this population,” he said in an email. “Also, there may have been increased volume in the emergency departments during marathon days, making the care for people with myocardial infarction less than ideal.”  "
2oz3HAC,2017-04-12,Older adults may lose ability to manage money and medications," (Reuters Health) - - A large proportion of older Americans will need assistance managing their medicines and finances as they age, and they need to plan for these changes along with their families, researchers say.   Among people in their late 60s who had no trouble managing their medications, for example, one in 10 developed difficulties over the next 10 years, the study team found. Among 85 year-olds without difficulty managing finances, seven in 10 developed a problem in the next decade.   “Most older adults want to live independently for as long as possible. The problem is, it’s hard to live independently if you have difficulty managing your medications or finances,” said study coauthor Dr. Alex Smith of the University of California at San Francisco.    “Most older adults who are managing their finances and medications independently now don’t know their risk of losing their ability to manage these tasks,” he told Reuters Health by email.   The ability to manage money and medications is different from many other aspects of daily functioning because it’s complex and depends entirely on cognitive skills, the researchers write in Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.    To estimate the 10-year risk for older people without difficulties of developing problems in these areas, Smith and colleagues analyzed data from the long-term U.S. Health and Retirement Study. They focused on 9,434 men and women who answered questionnaires every two years between 2002 and 2012. Questions included “Do you have any difficulty managing medications?” and “Do you have any difficulty managing your money, such as paying your bills and keeping track of expenses?”    Over 10 years, they found that 1,427 people, or 15 percent, developed difficulty with managing medications and 2,824, or 30 percent, developed difficulty with managing finances. About one third of the original study group died before developing difficulty with either task.   Both gender and age were strong predictors of who would develop problems. About 21 percent of women and 16 percent of men developed a difficulty managing medications. With finances, 34 percent of men and 36 percent of women developed a problem.    Among people aged 65 to 69 at the start of the study, 23 percent developed problems managing money over the next decade. Among 85-year-olds, 40 percent developed difficulty managing medications.   “We don’t help people anticipate the fact that they may lose these abilities,” said Dr. Holly Holmes of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, who wasn’t involved with the study.    “We assess them when the abilities are already gone, and people often don’t have a plan in place,” she told Reuters Health by email. “We rarely counsel 65-year-olds about their risk and how to plan for it.”   Other risk factors associated with developing a difficulty were stroke, low self-reported memory, low cognitive functioning and difficulty with other activities of daily living such as getting out of bed, eating, bathing, dressing or walking across a room.    “Day-to-day functioning is incredibly important. If you don’t have these abilities and don’t have someone to help you, it can threaten your life,” said Dr. Mark Lachs, director of Cornell University’s Center for Aging Research in New York City, who wasn’t involved with the study.    “The elephant in the room is that this study covers self-reported losses of function, so the rates are actually much higher for those who don’t realize they’ve lost their abilities,” he told Reuters Health.   Healthcare providers and policymakers should consider screenings for medication management and financial issues as patients age, Lachs added.   “Everybody who has an older parent has a story about scams or some type of abuse,” he said. “The cost of this is extraordinary, both medically and fiscally, and we need to develop a way to provide protections but not violate individual rights as people age.”  "
2omYFFf,2017-04-11,Physical inactivity linked to loss of independence," (Reuters Health) - - Being physically inactive raises the risk of losing the ability to perform activities of daily living - both before and after a stroke - according to results from a long-term U.S. study.    “Physical activity reduced the risk of dependence in both basic activities of daily living (for example, dressing and getting across a room) as well as instrumental activities of daily living (for example, managing money or grocery shopping), which are considered to be more cognitively demanding,” said lead author Dr. Pamela M. Rist from Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.   “These instrumental activities of daily living can be important determinants of quality of life among stroke patients, so it is important to find factors which reduce the risk of dependence in these activities as well as in basic activities of daily living,” she told Reuters Health by email.    Rist’s team studied 18,117 individuals participating in the national Health and Retirement Study in an effort to find out whether physical activity and body mass index (BMI), a common measure of overweight and obesity, could predict disability.   During 12 years of follow-up, the amount of physical activity people did was not associated with the risk of stroke, but it was associated with the likelihood of being independent three years after a stroke.    Those who were physically inactive at baseline were significantly less likely to be independent at that point, compared with those who were physically active at baseline.    Somewhat surprisingly, this difference between inactive and active stroke survivors was also evident three years before their strokes, researchers report in the journal Neurology.    Obesity, in contrast, was associated with an increased risk of stroke, but it was not associated with loss of independence during the follow-up period, regardless of whether an individual suffered a stroke.    “Individuals can reduce their risk of dependence before and after stroke events by being physically active, which in our study was defined as participating in vigorous physical activity at least three times per week,” Rist said.   The researchers recommend further study to clarify whether increases in physical activity might also improve outcomes after a stroke.  "
2okfAID,2017-04-10,Online forum reveals users may stop taking stroke-prevention pills," (Reuters Health) - - Stroke survivors may grow frustrated with doctors’ advice and ultimately stop taking medicines that could prevent a second stroke, suggests a new analysis from the UK.   Researchers who tracked internet discussion-board conversations about stroke found that most survivors followed their doctors’ advice but some stopped taking medications due to side effects.   “Family practitioners should make patients aware of multiple treatment options and the potential need for several changes in medication, and actively follow-up with their patients when providing advice or changing treatment due to side effects, such as aches and tiredness,” said senior author Anna De Simoni, of Queen Mary University of London.   De Simoni and colleagues write in Family Practice that three in 10 stroke survivors will go on to have a second stroke. Medications that lower blood pressure and cholesterol and thin the blood can reduce that risk by up to 75 percent.   Past research suggests patients who are prescribed these so-called secondary prevention medications may have trouble sticking to their regimens, the authors write.   For the new study, De Simoni’s team focused on posts made by 50 participants on the online TalkStroke forum, including 33 stroke survivors and 17 caregivers of stroke survivors.   Most people reported sticking to doctors’ orders, but that wasn’t always the case when people experienced side effects they felt were due to cholesterol-lowering medications known as statins, for example. Common side effects of those drugs include fatigue, headaches and muscle aches and pains.   “When suffering from statin side effects, patients did make contact with their doctors in the attempt to manage them, but I was surprised to see that they seemingly lost hope after only one or two contacts with their family physicians, unaware that a better regimen may have been available or that their doctor would have been able to carry out another change in medication,” De Simoni told Reuters Health in an email.   Side effects led to “anxiety and resentment” among patients, who felt their needs weren’t always being addressed by their doctors, the researchers found.   “The online dialogue between stroke survivors and carers offers a deeper understanding of the barriers to persistence with secondary prevention medications,” said De Simoni.   The research team found that people responding to the posts were generally supportive of doctors’ advice, and none of the posts was incorrect or misleading. “The forum’s ‘super-users’, who had a high number of connections with other participants, played an important role” in the quality of the content, said De Simoni.   The researchers warn that secondary stroke prevention has changed since the last posts analyzed in this study were written in 2011, so these patients’ issues may not reflect what happens in today’s doctors’ office. Additionally, the discussion board users were young; their behavior may not reflect the actions of older stroke patients.   “These findings indicate the need to raise patients’ awareness of the existence of several cholesterol lowering treatments and approaches to manage side effects,” said De Simoni.

2oYY4JQ,2017-04-10,Obese teens&#039; odds of high blood pressure vary by race," (Reuters Health) - Obesity is a strong predictor of high blood pressure early in life, but a U.S study suggests the connection may be stronger for Hispanic and white teens than for adolescents in other racial and ethnic groups.    Researchers examined weight, blood pressure and racial and ethnic data from more than 21,000 youth attending 27 secondary schools in the Houston area. About one-third were overweight or obese, and 2.7 percent had hypertension, or high blood pressure.    Overall, 6.6 percent of obese teens had high blood pressure, as did 2.6 percent of overweight youth and 1.6 percent of normal weight adolescents, the study found. Obesity was much more likely to increase the risk of high blood pressure in Hispanic and white participants.     “While increasing body mass index, a measure of obesity, was associated with increased risk for high blood pressure in all four ethnic groups, the prevalence of high blood pressure was almost six times higher among obese Hispanic adolescents compared to normal weight Hispanics,” said senior study author Dr. Joshua Samuels of the McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston.   “White adolescents also saw dramatic increases in blood pressure with obesity - four times higher - but there were fewer obese white children affected,” Samuels said by email.   Participants in the study were 14 years old on average and ranged in age from 10 to 19. Data were collected from 2000 to 2015.   About 23 percent of Hispanic youth were obese, as were 21 percent of black students, 13 percent of white adolescents and 10 percent of Asian participants.    Black students had the highest prevalence of high blood pressure among normal-weight and overweight study participants. But among obese participants, black youth had the lowest rates of hypertension.   At the same time, researchers found a disproportionate increase in the prevalence of high blood pressure for obese Hispanic and white teens.    Compared to normal weight Hispanic youth, their obese peers were 5.8 times more likely to have hypertension and their overweight counterparts were 2.2 times more likely, the study found.   Obese white teens were 4.1 times more likely to have high blood pressure than their normal weight peers, while obese black youth had 2.3 times the risk encountered by their normal weight counterparts.   The study isn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that obesity causes hypertension, and it excluded youth who were taking medication to control their blood pressure. Another limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on the timing of puberty for study participants, making it impossible to determine how this process might influence weight or blood pressure.   Even so, the results should serve as a reminder to screen obese teens for high blood pressure, regardless of ethnicity, said Dr. Mark DeBoer, a researcher at the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville who wasn’t involved in the study.    “While hypertension is most common among African American adults and has been seen less often among Hispanic adults, this study serves as notice that obese white and Hispanic children are at least as much at risk for hypertension as African-American children,” DeBoer said by email.   “Thinking about hypertension and performing regular screening should lead to earlier identification and treatment - and prevention of downstream consequences,” DeBoer added.  "
2p0mN0u,2017-04-10,Activity trackers not always great for monitoring exercise heart rate," (Reuters Health) - - Some people who rely on fitness trackers to see how hard they work out may want to rethink this approach, according to a small study that suggests the increasingly popular devices may get more accurate heart rate readings when users are at rest than during exercise.    The study tested four popular wristbands, each of which has a light-emitting diode (LED) that measures heart rate from tiny changes in skin blood volumes by using light reflected from the skin.    Participants in the study - 40 healthy adults - wore two trackers on each wrist and compared resting and exercise heart rate readings on the devices to the gold standard used by doctors: an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) test.    At rest, the Fitbit Surge got heart rate measurements that most closely matched the ECG results, and the Basis Peak was furthest off. In tests that also included the Fitbit Charge and Mio Fuse, none of the trackers got exercise heart rate readings that came close to the ECG.    These results suggest that while the trackers may help monitor daily activity, it’s not clear the heart rate readouts would be accurate enough to help patients with certain health problems make medical decisions, the authors note in Annals of Internal Medicine.   “At any moment, the tracker could be off by a fair bit, but at most moments, it won’t be,” said lead study author Lisa Cadmus-Bertram of the University of Wisconsin in Madison.    “This is why our paper doesn’t suggest that the commercial trackers we tested would be sufficient for medical applications where high precision is needed during exercise,” Cadmus-Bertram said by email. “Yet for the typical recreational user, they may still provide feedback that’s useful and motivational.”    To assess the accuracy of the trackers, researchers examined heart rate data for participants who were 49 years old on average and slightly overweight.    First, they looked at the amount of agreement between the readings from the trackers and the ECG tests.    When participants were seated, researchers took readings for the trackers and the ECG tests at one-minute intervals for 10 minutes.    The narrowest range of differences between the trackers and the ECG, indicating the most accuracy, was for the Fitbit Surge. The range for this tracker ranged from an underestimation of 5.1 beats per minute to an overestimation of 4.5 beats per minute.    The widest range of difference at rest was for the Basis Peak, which ranged from an underestimation of 17.1 beats per minute to an overestimation of 22.6 beats per minute.    When participants exercised on a treadmill, the ranges were even wider. The Mio Fuse ranged from an underestimation of 22.5 beats per minute to an overestimation of 26 beats per minute, for example, while the Fitbit Charge range from an underestimation of 41 beats per minute to an overestimation of 36 beats per minute.    The study is small, and researchers found only limited repeatability with results for the same participant under the same conditions.   Still, the findings are an important first step in understanding the clinical validity of wrist trackers many patients already use, said Dr. Daniel Cantillon, a researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio who wasn’t involved in the study.    “We need data testing these devices among patients with specific disease states, such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation and other chronic medical problems, where it is possible that additional variation will occur with physical activity,” Cantillon said by email.   In particular, patients with the most common heart rhythm disorder, atrial fibrillation, shouldn’t rely on the trackers to detect abnormal rhythms, said Dr. Sumeet Chugh, a researcher at Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles who wasn’t involved in the study.    “There is a lot at stake here,” Chugh said by email. “When it comes to the use of wrist-worn trackers, we need to be confident of accuracy comparable to treadmill testing if we are going to use the information for patient care.”   A spokesperson for Fitbit told Reuters Health that Fitbit trackers “are not intended to be medical devices” but instead “to give a more informed picture” of overall health. “Extensive internal studies . . . show that Fitbit’s PurePulse technology performs to industry standard expectations for optical heart rate on the wrist,” the spokesperson said.   Mark Gorelick, Chief Science Officer at Mio Global, said in a statement that the company’s technology “helps consumers understand the intensity of their exercise, based on their personal profile and heart rate data, and empowers them to proactively manage their health and reduce risk of lifestyle-related diseases.”  "
2p5jkNt,2017-04-07,California women have banned flame retardants in their bloodstreams," (Reuters Health) - Two toxic chemicals banned in the U.S. in 2005 are still finding their way into the bloodstreams of California women, suggesting that sources of exposure persist in homes and in the environment, researchers say.   The flame retardant chemicals called Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers, or PBDEs, were used to treat polyurethane foam, hard plastics, textiles, glues and wire insulation, among other products, until 2006 in the U.S. They were banned a few years earlier in Europe.   “We don’t fully understand the health consequences of exposures to these chemicals in humans. Laboratory studies in animals, however, have shown that PBDEs can interfere with normal development of the neurologic system, disrupt the proper functioning of the immune and hormonal systems, and may promote cancer” lead author Susan Hurley told Reuters Health in an email.   “Concerns that similar effects might occur in people led to the voluntary phase-out and banning of these chemicals,” said Hurley, a researcher with the Cancer Prevention Institute of California, in Berkeley.   Small studies in the past, almost entirely focused on young women, suggested that PBDE levels in people dropped immediately after the chemicals were banned, Hurley said.    To check more recent levels in a larger and different population, the researchers analyzed blood samples from 1,253 women participating in an ongoing study of California teachers. The participants, mostly between the ages of 60 and 79, provided blood samples regularly between May 2011 and August 2015.   Exposure to PBDEs was common, Hurley said, “(they) were found in at least three-quarters of the women we tested.” And there was a small, but statistically meaningful increase in the blood levels of both chemicals over the four-year study period, the study team reports in Environmental Science and Technology.    “Our results . . . which focus on a more recent time period, suggest that there may be a recent shift in exposure pathways such that the diet may be becoming more important,” Hurley said.   Before the ban, people were primarily exposed to the chemicals by ingesting and inhaling dust from furniture and other PBDE-laden products, Hurley said.   “As the ban took effect and these products have been replaced with newer PBDE-free products, exposures from indoor dust probably have declined.  However, as the old products are now being disposed of in landfills and incinerators, it is likely that the outdoor environment is becoming increasingly contaminated,” she said.   PBDEs aren’t easily broken down in the environment, Hurley noted, so they eventually find their way into the food chain.     “This is exactly what we witnessed with PCBs, a class of toxic pollutants that were banned nearly 40 years ago. While initially PCB body burden levels declined, they eventually leveled off and remained steady for decades as people have been continually exposed through the food they eat. It appears that exposures to PBDEs may be following a similar trajectory,” she said.   “If our findings of sustained and possibly increasing PBDE body burden levels are replicated in other contemporary populations, it will underscore the urgency to take additional regulatory actions to manage the safe disposal of PBDE-laden furniture and other PBDE-laced products to reduce environmental contamination and minimize dietary exposures,” she said.   “Although there are some limitations in the study, the findings have significant public health implications, suggesting that human exposure to PBDEs are still existing,” said Dr. Yawei Zhang, a researcher at the Yale School of Public Health in New Haven, Connecticut, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Although the PBDEs have been phased out, people may be exposed to these chemicals continuously due to their persistence, ubiquity, and bioaccumulation,” said Zhang, who is currently investigating serum concentrations of PBDEs and risk of thyroid cancer in military personnel.   “While the commercial formulations containing these particular chemicals have been banned, they have been replaced with similar compounds whose health effects are not yet fully understood,” Hurley noted.     Avoiding the use of substitutions that will pose similar problems in the future is a goal of California’s Safer Consumer Products Program ( bit.ly/O1SYsM ), Hurley said.  "
2oKMoxx,2017-04-07,Kidney transplant vouchers could address timing issues," (Reuters Health) - - Creating kidney transplant vouchers for future transplants could reduce the long waiting list for organs in the United States, a new study suggests.   In particular, a voucher program could help with “chronological incompatibility,” when the donor wants to provide a kidney but the patient doesn’t need it yet.   “Innovative solutions to increasing living donation are always needed because of the high level of need for living donor kidneys,” said study author Amy Waterman, director of the Transplant Research and Education Center at the University of California at Los Angeles.   More than 100,000 patients are on the waiting list in the United States, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing.    “Living donors are rare and very valuable for improving the health of recipients,” Waterman told Reuters Health by email. “Strategies to allow more living donors to overcome practical challenges to help another should be supported.”   In a report in the journal Transplantation, Waterman and colleagues described three voucher cases that allowed donors to overcome chronological incompatibility for recipients who didn’t yet need a kidney but might need one in the future. The three cases also triggered a donation chain that allowed 25 transplants to occur across the U.S.   In the first case, a four-year-old with chronic kidney disease was projected to need a renal transplant in 10 to 15 years. His 64-year-old grandfather wanted to donate a kidney when his grandson needed it but didn’t want his candidacy as a donor to disappear as he aged.    The National Kidney Registry Medical Board allowed the grandfather to donate his kidney now for his grandson to receive priority for another kidney in the future when he needed it. The board stipulated that the voucher had no monetary value, could only be used for his grandson, couldn’t be transferred to another patient, and couldn’t guarantee that a kidney would be available.    In December 2014, the grandfather donated his kidney, which triggered a transplant chain with three recipients who were able to discontinue dialysis. The grandson hasn’t needed the voucher yet.   “This began developing based on requests from patients,” said Stuart Flechner of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, who wasn’t involved with this study. Flechner studies kidney-paired donations.    “This is a way to capture donors who might otherwise not have donated if it went through the usual sequencing,” he told Reuters Health. “It’s based on an individual’s desire to donate now so a loved one can receive another kidney later.”   In the second case, a 10-year-old girl underwent a kidney transplant in 2007. Although it went well, her 52-year-old father wanted to donate a kidney several years later as a “back-up” in case she needed it. He wanted to use a voucher to donate the kidney before he got too old. In 2015, he donated a kidney, which triggered a chain of eight transplants.    The third case involved the same patient from the second case. Her doctors believed she might require a third transplant in the future to avoid dialysis, so the girl’s 60-year-old aunt also donated a kidney in 2016. The donation initiated a chain of 14 kidney transplants and provided a second voucher for her niece.   When adopting use of vouchers, transplant centers must consider the effects of redemptions and guard against the potential for gaming the system, the study authors say. For example, if recipients don’t need the transplant or die first from other causes, the voucher can’t be sold or traded.    At the same time, a voucher system could motivate family members to donate out of altruism now rather than hold back in case their loved ones need a kidney in the future.    “The more transplants we can arrange, the more people we can help,” said Blake Ellison of Harvard Law School in Boston, who wasn’t involved with this study. Ellison has researched kidney-paired donations and the U.S. model.   “Vouchers remove some of the barriers to donation . . . as a result, donated kidneys will not only be more plentiful, but healthier, too,” he told Reuters Health. “Matching systems are such that increasing the number of kidneys to be matched results in more matches and better matches.”  "
2o6G1Tz,2017-04-06,How consent requirements may shape teen mental health research," (Reuters Health) - - Requiring teens to get permission from their parents to participate in studies about behavioral health may make it harder to understand adolescent psychology - especially when drugs and alcohol are involved - a U.S. study suggests.    That’s because teens are less likely to complete surveys if they have to seek permission to answer questions about risky or illegal behaviors, the study found. Plus, these studies may not include enough older adolescents, boys or black youth to accurately reflect what’s happening in these populations.    “Requiring parental consent may introduce a systematic bias that excludes certain segments of our population,” said lead study author Chao Liu of Oklahoma State University in Stillwater.    “If this is the case, then the treatments and prevention interventions developed may not adequately address the needs of these populations,” Liu said by email.    In the U.S., minors under age 18 generally need permission from their parents to get medical treatment or participate in research, researchers note in the Journal of Adolescent Health.   When it comes to research, consent may be “active,” requiring parents to explicitly give their permission for kids to join studies or it may be “passive,” allowing youth to participate unless parents opt out. As a rule, studies involving patient care use active consent, but some survey research uses passive consent.    Liu and colleagues examined data from 15 previously published studies with a total of 104,074 children to see how the consent policies influenced which kids participated and how they responded to questions about risky or illegal behaviors.    With active consent, females and younger youth were more likely to participate than males or older teens, the study found. White children were also more likely to join these studies than Hispanic youth, but this difference was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    Black teens were more likely to join studies with passive consent than active consent, the study also found.    With passive consent, teens were much more likely to report using drugs or alcohol than with active consent.    “Teens may not want their parent to know about behaviors, specifically risky behaviors, for fear of getting in trouble,” said Dr. Jill Beck, a researcher at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Requiring parental consent may influence some teens to either not participate in a study at all or give false information,” Beck said by email.    One limitation of the analysis is that it included too few studies to make broad conclusions about how about how the type of consent influences who participates or what participants say, the authors note. It’s also possible the findings would be different outside the U.S. where laws on parental consent for research might differ.   “The question is whether adolescents must be viewed as a vulnerable subgroup for whom parental consent is necessary to ensure appropriate protection, or whether requiring this additional layer of consent actually robs adolescents of opportunities to contribute to research as participants in certain circumstances,” Dr. Reshma Jagsi, an ethics researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    The answer is complicated, and age alone isn’t a very good way of determining whether teens have the capacity to make informed decisions about participating in research, said Dr. Yoram Unguru of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics in Baltimore.    “Healthy, older children who lack experience with medical decision-making or whose parents have insulated them from making certain life decisions may have decreased capacity,” Unguru, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “Younger children with chronic illness or poor health with all its experiences and choices or whose parents have allowed them to make life decisions may have been challenged to develop increased capacity and may be better equipped to appreciate that their choices carry certain consequences and may, therefore have greater understanding of participating in medical and research decisions than an older healthy child,” Unguru added.

2oEh1Eo,2017-04-06,Kids with autism struggle to read facial expressions," (Reuters Health) - Children with autism may have a harder time reading emotions on people’s faces than other kids, but they also misunderstand the feelings they see in a way that’s pretty similar to youth without autism, a small study suggests.   “We found that on average, young people with autism are a bit less accurate at recognizing all expressions, not just the subtle ones,” said lead study author Sarah Griffiths of the University of Cambridge’s Autism Research Center in the UK.   “The types of mistakes that children with autism make like confusing scared and surprised are the same types of mistakes made by typically developing children,” Griffiths, who did the research at the University of Bristol, said by email. “So it’s not just that children with autism interpret emotions completely differently, but they are more likely to make common misinterpretations.”   About one in 68 children have autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which includes autism as well as Asperger syndrome and other pervasive developmental disorders, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is more often diagnosed in boys than in girls.   People with autism often have problems with social, emotional and communication skills. They might repeat certain behaviors and might not want change in their daily activities. Many people with autism also have different ways of learning, paying attention or reacting to things.   Some previous research has linked autism to difficulties reading facial expressions, but results have been mixed and certain studies haven’t found this evidence of this connection, researchers note in the Journal of Autism Developmental Disorders.    For the study, researchers gave an online test of emotion recognition to 63 children and teens with autism and to 64 youth without this diagnosis. Participants saw “happy,” “sad,” “surprised,” “disgusted,” “scared” and “angry” facial expressions; some faces had exaggerated “high-intensity” emotions designed to be easy to read and others had subtle “low-intensity” feelings designed to be more challenging to interpret.    Participants were around 11 years old on average. Most of the kids in the autism group were male, compared to about half of the children in the group without autism.    The research team had expected to find a smaller difference between the groups in recognizing high-intensity emotions.    Instead, they found a bigger difference with more intense emotions, likely because children in both groups made similar errors in recognizing subtle feelings. This made it hard for researchers to detect clear differences between the kids with and without autism.    One limitation of the study is that many participants who started the online facial recognition test didn’t finish it; this happened with 30 percent of participants with autism, the authors note. This might be because people are less likely to complete a repetitive test online at home than they might be under supervision in a lab, the researchers speculate. Another drawback of online testing is that researchers lacked a confirmed clinical diagnosis of autism.    Still, previous brain imaging studies have found areas of the brain involved in decoding emotions and facial expressions are less active in people with autism, said Geraldine Dawson, director of the Duke Center for Autism in Durham, North Carolina.    “The good news is that we can help people with autism learn to interpret facial expressions,” Dawson, who wasn’t involved in the current study, said by email.    “Early behavioral intervention focuses on helping the young child with autism pay attention and respond appropriately to facial expressions,” Dawson added. “There are also training programs in which people with autism can be taught explicitly what each facial expression means and then practice these skills in real life settings.”  "
2ngHrw9,2017-04-06,Parental smoking linked to genetic changes in kids with cancer," (Reuters Health) - - Parents who smoke may contribute to genetic changes in their kids that are associated with the most common type of childhood cancer, a recent study suggests.                     A tourist smokes a cigarette in Valletta, Malta, November 13, 2016. REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi      Some previous research has linked parental smoking to an increased risk of childhood leukemia, but with less consistent results for mothers than for fathers. The current study is the first to link smoking by both parents to specific genetic changes in tumor cells of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), said lead study author Adam de Smith, a researcher at the University of California San Francisco’s Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.   “Another way of looking at this is that we are seeing evidence of the toxic effects of tobacco smoke in the genes of the leukemia cell, a molecular type of forensic pathology,” de Smith said by email.    “These deletions are not inherited from parents but are acquired in the child’s immune cells, so we think the more important windows of tobacco exposure are during pregnancy and after birth,” he added.    Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a cancer that starts from the early version of white blood cells called lymphocytes in the bone marrow, the soft inner part of the bones where new blood cells are made. With this type of cancer, the bone marrow makes irregular lymphocytes with errors known as deletions in their DNA, causing unchecked growth that crowds out healthy cells.    Each year about 5,970 new cases of ALL are diagnosed in the U.S. and about 1,440 people die from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society. The risk of developing ALL is highest in children under age 5, though the majority of the deaths occur with adult cases.    For the current study, researchers examined data on pre-treatment tumor samples from 559 ALL patients in a study of childhood leukemia cases in California. They wanted to see if any of the eight genes that are often deleted in ALL patients were missing in the tumor samples, and whether any of these deletions were associated with parental smoking habits.    Roughly two thirds of the tumor samples contained at least one of these deletions, the study in Cancer Research found.   Deletions were considerably more common in children whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy and after birth. For each five cigarettes smoked daily during pregnancy, there was a 22 percent increase in the number of deletions; and for each five cigarettes smoked daily during breastfeeding, there was a 74 percent increase in the number of deletions.    Smoking of five cigarettes daily by the mother or father before conception also was associated with a 7 percent to 8 percent increase in the number of deletions.    Boys were found to be more sensitive to the effects of maternal smoking, including smoking that occurred pre-conception. This could be explained by the fact that male fetuses grow more rapidly, leading to increased vulnerability of developing lymphocytes to toxins that cause genetic damage, the authors note.   One limitation of the study is that researchers don’t know when genetic deletions occurred relative to the development of leukemia. Researchers also relied on parents to accurately recall and report their smoking habits in questionnaires, making it possible the timing or amount of tobacco exposure might be incorrect in some cases.    Still, the findings should reinforce how important it is for parents to quit or cut back tobacco use, said Dr. Marte Reigstad, a researcher at Oslo University Hospital in Norway who wasn’t involved in the study.    “The best thing to do to reduce risk to a minimum is to cut out smoking altogether,” Reigstad, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    For people who grew up with parents that smoked, it’s important to understand that tobacco isn’t the only thing that causes cancer, Reigstad added.    “Living healthy lives can also reduce cancer risk, especially concerning exercise and keeping a healthy body weight,” Reigstad said.

2nognpI,2017-04-05,"Yo-yo dieting hikes death, heart risks in overweight heart disease patients"," (Reuters Health) - - For overweight people with heart disease, trying and failing to lose weight may be more dangerous than not losing weight at all.    A new retrospective study has concluded that patients whose weight fluctuates the most die twice as quickly or have twice the risk of heart attack or stroke compared to people who maintain a stable body weight.   And their risk of developing diabetes grows by 78 percent.   The findings, which need to be confirmed by further research, suggest a life-and-death conundrum. Being overweight is already known to pose serious health risks. The new research says dropping the pounds and putting them back on again poses additional dangers.   If you are an overweight person with heart disease who lost 20 pounds “you are worse off if you drop your weight and gain it back” than if you didn’t lose it in the first place, chief author Dr. Sripal Bangalore, an interventional cardiologist and associate professor of medicine at New York University’s Langone Medical Center told Reuters Health by phone.   The study is saying, “If you’re going to lose weight, do it right and you need to take it seriously,” said Dr. Ira Ockene, a professor of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, who was not connected with the research.   If people use the results as an excuse not to drop unhealthy pounds, “that would be unfortunate,” Ockene told Reuters Health. “There’s a lot of data that says if you lose weight and keep it off, you do better.”   “Hopefully this will be used as a motivation to lose weight and maintain weight,” Bangalore said.   Such yo-yo dieting, where a person’s weight fluctuates repeatedly, is already known to be unhealthy in people without heart disease.    The new study in the New England Journal of Medicine explored whether that was specifically true for people with coronary artery disease, where fatty deposits have built up in the blood vessels feeding the heart muscle. The researchers recycled data from 9,509 volunteers who were part of a Lipitor study published in 2005 and sponsored by Pfizer.    Another important limitation of the study: It did not examine whether patients lost weight because they tried to, or if their weight fluctuated because they were battling illness.   After adjusting for various factors such as high blood pressure, smoking, race, gender, diabetes, cholesterol levels and treatment with Lipitor, the Bangalore team found that people whose weights fluctuated the most were 2.24 times more likely to die from any cause within about five years, 2.17 times more likely to have a heart attack and 2.36 times more likely to be hit with a stroke than people whose weights were the most stable.   For every 3- or 4-pound change in body weight, their risk of heart attack, cardiac arrest, chest pain, death from heart disease or the need for surgery to open a clogged artery rose by 4 percent.   The dangers posed by shifting weight were least pronounced in people who had a normal weight to begin with.   Ockene said people need to put weight loss in perspective.   “Studies show people set unattainable goals. Heavy people say, ‘I need to lose 40 pounds’ and they set a goal that is largely unattainable. And when they lose 10 pounds they’re disappointed. And they say, ‘What the hell’ and they just gain it back,” he said.   “But if you lose 10 pounds and keep it off, your diabetes will be better, your blood pressure will be better, your lipids will be better, a lot of things will be better. You don’t need to lose 30 or 40 pounds,” he said. “That’s an important issue for people to understand.”   As a typical example of patients in the study whose weights fluctuated significantly, the researchers cited the case of a 53-year-old man whose weight went from 231 pounds to 244 pounds three months later, then dropped to 211 pounds eighteen months later before going up to 253 pounds after another 18 months had passed.  "
2nPkmxE,2017-04-05,Follow-up finds clot-grabbing devices offer better stroke outcomes," (Reuters Health) - - Long-term follow-up of patients in a 2014 study confirms that stroke patients recover better if doctors physically remove a clot from a blocked artery instead of just letting the clot-busting drug tPA try to do the job.   The conclusion is based on 500 Dutch patients treated in a landmark study known as MR CLEAN. The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, may encourage more hospitals to adopt the technique.    In earlier results from the study, one third of patients whose treatment included using a device to extract a clot from a brain artery achieved functional independence by the 90-day mark after their strokes compared to 19 percent given usual care.   Now, two years of data show functional independence for 37 percent of patients with clot removal versus 24 percent with clot-busting drugs alone.   “We are delighted. It is icing on the cake,” said Dr. Reza Jahan of the University of California at Los Angeles Stroke Center, who was not connected with the study. “It confirms the long-term durability” of the technique and it will encourage more centers to use it, he said.   The MR CLEAN study, combined with subsequent positive results released soon afterward, “has made a huge difference” in how doctors treat strokes said study coauthor Yvo Roos, a neurologist at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. “This is now standard care,” he told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.   Figuring out which hospitals offer the therapy can be difficult for consumers, however. There is no easy to find list of U.S. facilities, known as comprehensive stroke centers, that are certified to offer the treatment whenever needed.    Jahan said the new study results reinforce efforts to evaluate stroke patients before they even reach a hospital and then immediately get them to one of these comprehensive stroke centers if they are candidates for clot removal.   “It will get these patients to the treatment they need faster, rather than the current model, where they may go to a primary stroke center to get clot-busting drugs and valuable time is lost trying to transport them to a comprehensive stroke center,” he said by phone.   The findings apply to patients whose strokes were the result of a blockage in the large forward arteries of the brain, which is the most common type of stroke and affects up to 125,000 patients in the U.S. and 90,000 in Europe each year.   Typically, the clot-busting drugs only open the blocked artery in about a third of the cases, which is why doctors have hoped that removing the clot directly would produce better recovery.   Clot removal is expensive - $57,031 for the extraction and for the first 90 days of other stroke treatment, according an analysis published in December in the journal Stroke. Treatment without clot extraction cost $44,752.   With the results showing a long-term benefit with extraction, “this up-front expense is going to be justified because, in the long term, we’ll see a reduction in medical care, nursing care, home care and rehabilitation care,” Jahan predicted. “We’re saving money in the long run. Patients who would have been stuck in a skilled nursing facility for two years, hopefully, are now being sent home.”   Quality of life scores at two years were higher in the clot-removal treatment group, with the big differences reported in the categories of mobility, self-care and the ability to do usual activities.   The cumulative rates of death from any cause were comparable in the two groups during the two years after a stroke, at 26 percent among clot removal patients and 31 percent among those who didn’t get that treatment.    But Roos and his colleagues note that the difference in mortality rates has grown as time passed  "
2nI6wP9,2017-04-05,"With same training, insulin pumps no better than injections"," (Reuters Health) - - Adults with type 1 diabetes may be able to manage their blood sugar levels just as well with multiple daily insulin injections as they can with continuous insulin pumps, a recent study suggests.                     A diabetic applies an Insulin pen injection in Vienna November 13, 2012.  REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader      In type 1 diabetes, a lifelong condition, the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone needed to allow blood sugar to enter cells and produce energy. People with the condition usually have to test their own blood sugar level throughout the day and inject insulin to manage it; otherwise they risk complications like heart disease and kidney damage.   Some previous research has suggested pumps may help patients get better blood sugar control than they can achieve by giving themselves multiple daily insulin injections. But patients tend to get more intensive training on managing their blood sugar with pumps than they do with injections, so some doctors have questioned whether better patient education might be the reason pumps get better results.    For the current study, researchers set out to answer this question. They offered 260 adults with type 1 diabetes the same education on how to manage their blood sugar, also known as blood glucose, and then randomly assigned participants to use pumps or daily injections.    “What the trial shows fairly unequivocally is that education/training can produce considerable benefit, although it leaves many patients still a long way from current glucose targets,” said lead study investigator Dr. Simon Heller, a diabetes researcher at the University of Sheffield in the UK.    To compare pumps to injections, researchers examined average blood sugar levels over the course of several months by measuring changes to the hemoglobin molecule in red blood cells. The hemoglobin A1c test measures the percentage of hemoglobin that is coated with sugar, with readings of 6.5 percent or above signaling diabetes.   At the start of the study, participants had average A1c readings of 9.1 percent, indicating poorly controlled blood sugar with an increased risk of serious complications.    After two years of follow-up, most patients still had poorly controlled blood sugar. People using the pumps achieved average A1c reductions of 0.85 percentage points, compared with 0.42 percentage points with multiple daily injections, researchers report in the BMJ.    Once researchers accounted for other factors that can influence blood sugar such as age, sex and treatment center, the difference in A1c for pump versus injection patients was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    There are many different types of pumps and injection devices on the market, and one limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t examine how specific design features might influence how well patients succeeded in managing their blood sugar, the authors note.    It’s also possible that the effort to give pump and injection patients the same level of education may have skewed the results because in real life, patients might get more education when they start using pumps than they would for injections, said Dr. Roman Hovorka, director of research at the University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories in the UK.   Pumps also have a technological advantage that wasn’t addressed in the study, Hovorka, who wasn’t involved in the research, said by email. These devices can collect data on insulin delivery and blood sugar levels and transmit that information to clinicians, enabling doctors to adjust treatment based on the results.    But because pumps are much more expensive than injections, it doesn’t make sense to use them unless they have a proven advantage for blood sugar control, said Dr. Edwin Gale, emeritus professor of diabetes at the University of Bristol in the UK.   In the UK, pumps cost about 2,500 pounds ($3,116.25) a year plus an additional 1,500  pounds ($1,869.75) for batteries and other supplies, researchers note.    “I think the take-home message for patients is that pumps won’t do the job for you,” Gale said by email. “They are not for everyone, and many people can do just as well on multiple injections.”  "
2oug4Pj,2017-04-04,San Francisco makes the healthy choice the easy choice," (Reuters Health) - - Patients are regularly urged by their doctors to quit drinking soda - only to leave the doctor’s office and come face to face with a Big Gulp. Not at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.   In 2015, the university removed all sugar-sweetened beverages from every store, cafeteria, food truck and restaurant on its sprawling campuses. And the city of San Francisco is poised to become the first in the U.S. to rid all its hospitals of the drinks that researchers believe feed national epidemics of obesity and diabetes.   Both efforts are part of a unique collaboration between public health officials and advocates, academic researchers and community coalitions described in a new report in Preventing Chronic Disease, a publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    Dubbed the San Francisco Health Improvement Partnership, the collaboration has improved public health in the city of 850,000 in three ways: it reduced consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages; it restricted retail alcohol sales; and it provided dental care to previously undeserved children.    The partnership stole a page from the anti-smoking playbook in its attack on soda, said lead author Dr. Kevin Grumbach, who chairs the department of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).   “We need to apply the lessons of tobacco control to other health conditions,” he said in a phone interview. “The biggest impact was through taxes and environmental restrictions on smoking.”   In addition to getting hospitals and hospital food vendors to stop serving soda, the partnership helped enact a voter-approved tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in San Francisco last year.    It also helped stop Starbucks and Taco Bell from receiving liquor licenses in San Francisco, helped prevent state authorization of powdered alcohol and worked to increase the number of medical clinics painting cavity-preventing fluoride varnish onto children’s teeth during routine well-child visits.   “When you get people to get out of their silos and work together, you can really make a difference in the conditions that create healthy communities,” Grumbach said.   Listening to residents of low-income communities proved vital for selling them on the benefits of taxing sugary beverages, Grumbach said. He experienced an “aha” moment when a member of a community group suggested that free water-filling stations she’d seen near yoga studios should be brought into her neighborhood, where lower-income residents tended to quench their thirst with soda.    “It’s making the healthy choice the easy choice,” Grumbach said.   Nutrition epidemiologist Barry Popkin, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, applauded the effort of the San Francisco partnership.   “This is the kind of change we need at the national, state and local level if we’re going to remove some of the major health disparities,” he said in a phone interview.   “It’s the direction of the future if we’re going to truly impact the diets of the poor in any meaningful way,” said Popkin, who was not involved in the new study.   Grumbach’s coauthor Laura Schmidt said that after research from UCSF repeatedly exposed public health harms associated with soda, their colleagues felt compelled to act.   “We just felt as an institution that the right thing to do was to get out of the business of selling sugary beverages or profiting from them,” Schmidt, a sociology and public health professor at the School of Medicine, said in a phone interview.   “We ought to model a healthy food environment,” she said. “If we don’t do it, who will?”   Low-income hospital workers appear to be the biggest beneficiaries of the hospital soda ban, Schmidt said.    In a separate, as-yet unpublished study, researchers followed 2,500 of the medical center’s 24,000 employees. The lowest-paid workers - janitors, cafeteria workers and shuttle drivers - drank on average 30 ounces a day of sugary beverages before the ban, while professors drank on average about 4 ounces a day, Schmidt said.   Six months after the ban took effect, she said, the lowest-wage workers were drinking 25 percent less soda.   “It’s a real success story,” Schmidt said.   All University of California campuses now are considering banning soda, and the San Francisco campus is considering health interventions seen at other campuses, like signs at elevators on the Los Angeles campus pointing to stairwells - a cardio-healthy, calorie-reducing way of ascending and descending.   “We learned something from the tobacco debates. Physicians used to smoke at the bedside in hospitals. The candy striper would sell you cigarettes,” Schmidt said. “Some day our children will look back and say, ‘You were giving people soda in bed when they were sick in the hospital?’”  "
2nGrkUy,2017-04-04,Stem cells plus scaffold may spur repair of torn tendons," (Reuters Health) – - A combination of advanced scaffold material and so-called adult stem cells improves the healing of rotator cuff tendon tears over surgery alone, a study in rats suggests.   “As an orthopedic shoulder and knee surgeon and chemical engineer, I think the combination of advanced materials and adult stem cells holds great promise,” Dr. Cato T. Laurencin from University of Connecticut in Farmington told Reuters Health. “For the shoulder, we are looking next to bring this type of technology to clinical use for the treatment of partial thickness and full thickness rotator cuff tendon tears,” he said by email.    Rotator cuff tendon tears are common and often require surgical repair, but most severe tears recur and require additional surgery. Because tendons are made mainly of collagen fibers, with few cells, they have little capacity for regeneration on their own, Laurencin’s team writes in the online journal PLoS ONE.    To see if mimicking the environment in which tendons normally grow would help repaired tendons to heal better than surgery alone, the researchers tested an artificial scaffold embedded with stem cells in a rats with a surgically repaired tendon tear. They compared how well it healed to the same kind of repair in rats that had only the surgery.   The tears repaired with stitches alone continued to show disorganized tissue 12 weeks after surgery, while tendons appeared much more normal after repair using the approach that combines advanced scaffold material with cells to engineer ideal conditions for tissue regeneration.   The addition of stem cells in the matrix, or scaffold, also led to increased mechanical strength and more normal characteristics of the replacement tendon tissue, compared with suturing alone, the study authors note.   The stem cells themselves disappeared over time, suggesting that the therapeutic effect resulted from their release of growth factors or other signaling molecules, rather than from the stem cells turning into tendon.    “We believe they can change the local environment and make it more compatible for regeneration,” Laurencin said. “The stem cells don’t have to become new tissue; they can work by influencing the environment to make better, regenerated tissue. The use of a nanotechnology based matrix is important in making it happen. That’s what this study suggests.”    “We are also developing this type of technology for use in treating problems of the knee,” he noted.   “We believe that the future for tissue regeneration lies in the combination of a number of areas of science and technology: advanced materials science, stem cell science, understanding how physical forces work in regeneration, developmental biology, and clinical translation,” Laurencin said.   “The work presented here combines many elements of regenerative engineering. The real successes will see not just using stem cells alone, but the convergence of different technologies. This new direction in thinking will provide exciting new possibilities for patients in the years to come,” he said.   "
2mW6P5S,2017-04-05,"More people using seat belts in the U.S., but still not enough"," (Reuters Health) - Even though a growing number of Americans are wearing seat belts, there are very few places in the U.S. where more than nine in 10 people buckle up in the front seat, a recent study suggests.    Overall, about 86 percent of Americans said they always used a seat belt in 2012, an increase of 8.4 percent from 2002, the study found.    Despite this progress, only 2.2 percent of U.S. counties have managed to achieve a government safety goal for reducing crash deaths: getting at least 92 percent of drivers and front-seat passengers to buckle up for every ride.    “Seat belts save lives,” said lead study author Dr. Jacob Sunshine of the University of Washington in Seattle.    “The challenge is how to encourage the drivers and riders who don’t use a safety belt every time they ride in a car to change their behavior,” Sunshine said by email. “This could be achieved through enhanced law enforcement and/or educational programs that clearly show the harms of riding without a seat belt.”   In 2015, deaths from motor vehicle crashes had the largest proportionate one-year increase since 1966, and 2016 appears to have logged even more fatalities, researchers note in the journal Health Affairs.    Seat belts can reduce crash fatalities by as much as 40 to 60 percent, the study authors note.    That message appears to resonate more in states that give drivers more legal reasons to listen to it, the study suggests.    Counties with less seat belt use tended to be in North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Nebraska and Alaska. All of these states have so-called “secondary enforcement” laws prohibiting traffic stops just for failure to wear a seat belt; instead drivers in these states can only be ticketed for seat belt violations if they got pulled over for another reason.    Conversely, counties that had higher seat belt use were in North Carolina, California, Maryland and metropolitan areas of Texas, all states that had so-called “primary enforcement” laws on the books allowing traffic stops just for failure to wear a seat belt.    Seat belt compliance rates were more than 10 percentage points higher in counties with laws permitting tickets just for not buckling up, the study found. Currently, 34 states and the District of Columbia have these laws on the books.    Women tended to wear seat belts more often than men: 90 percent of the time versus 82 percent of the time, the study also found.    But men improved more during the study period, with compliance going up by 11 percent from 2002 to 2012 compared to a 6 percent gain for women.    The study isn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that seat belts save lives or that specific law enforcement policies directly influence seat belt use. Researchers also didn’t examine crash or fatality data.    Even so, the findings add to growing evidence suggesting that seat belt laws can be effective at getting more drivers and passengers to buckle up, said Dr. Lois Lee, an emergency medicine physician and researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital who wasn’t involved in the study.    The scant number of counties meeting that 92 percent U.S. target for seat belt use might be explained in part by a lack of awareness of the state laws, Lee said by email.     “Often people don’t know the enforcement level - primary or secondary - in their state, and the law is variably enforced,” Lee said. “Thus people don’t always have a strong incentive, except the interest of their own health and the health of their passengers, to buckle up every time.”  "
2nU0w64,2017-04-03,Anorexia nervosa diagnosis more common in women with celiac disease," (Reuters Health) - - Women with celiac disease may be more likely to also be diagnosed with the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, researchers suggest.    In a nationwide study, a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa was more likely both before a celiac disease diagnosis, and afterward.   “Before this study, there have been published a few small `case reports’ of patients with celiac disease developing eating disturbances after their celiac disease diagnosis,” said lead study author Dr. Karl Marild, a researcher at the University of Colorado in Aurora.    “This, however, is the first large study to show an association between celiac disease and anorexia nervosa,” Marild said by email.    Anorexia nervosa is an emotional disorder that involves an obsessive desire to lose weight by refusing to eat. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which consumption of the gluten protein in wheat, barley or rye leads to damage of the small intestine and problems with absorption of nutrients from food.    The two disorders sometimes share similar symptoms, like fatigue, abdominal problems, discomfort after eating, excessive weight loss and an inability to absorb certain nutrients.   For the study, researchers examined data collected from 1987 through 2009 on almost 18,000 Swedish women diagnosed with celiac disease and roughly 89,000 women around the same age who didn’t have the autoimmune disorder.    After a celiac disease diagnosis, women were 46 percent more likely to be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, researchers report in Pediatrics. After an anorexia diagnosis, women had twice the odds of a later diagnosis of celiac disease.   More specifically, each year during the study period, a new diagnosis of anorexia nervosa was made in about 0.03 percent in women with a diagnosis of celiac disease, compared to about 0.02 percent in women without celiac disease.    Also, the researchers report, nearly 0.2 percent of women with celiac disease had been previously diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, compared to only about 0.1 percent of women in the study who didn’t have celiac disease.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that celiac disease causes anorexia, or that the reverse is true, the authors note.    It’s possible that at least some patients were initially misdiagnosed with one disease when they had the other disorder, the researchers point out. At least some of the overlap in diagnoses of both conditions might be explained by what’s known as “surveillance bias,” or the fact that women being closely monitored due to one issue with eating might be more likely to be evaluated for another food-related health problem.    In addition, dietary restrictions prescribed for celiac disease might trigger an obsessive eating pattern that leads to anorexia, Marild said.    The potential for misdiagnosis may be particularly important in treating teens, Dr. Neville Golden, an adolescent medicine researcher at Stanford Children’s Health in California writes in an accompanying editorial.    “Both celiac disease and anorexia nervosa may have similar symptoms: abdominal discomfort after eating, a feeling of fullness, changes in bowel habits and weight loss,” Golden said by email. “So the correct diagnosis may not always be clear.”   With either diagnosis, it’s important that patients see a specialist, said Alice Bast, chief executive officer of Beyond Celiac, a patient advocacy organization.   “The higher level of scrutiny by informed healthcare providers may unearth problems that might fly under the radar otherwise,” Bast, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

2nT1TBX,2017-04-03,Vaccinating pregnant moms protects newborns from whooping cough," (Reuters Health) - Infants are much less likely to get whooping cough if their mothers are vaccinated against the potentially fatal respiratory infection during pregnancy, a large U.S. study finds.    The bacteria Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough, which gets its nickname from the sounds patients make as they gasp for air during intense coughing fits. Pertussis is highly contagious and easily spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. About half of babies under age one who catch pertussis require hospitalization for serious complications like pneumonia or brain disorders.    For the study, researchers examined data on almost 149,000 infants born in California from 2010 to 2015. They found babies whose mothers got the Tdap booster vaccine for tetnanus, diphtheria and pertussis were 91 percent less likely to get whooping cough during the first two months of life, a critical period before U.S. infants typically get their first dose of the pertussis vaccine.    “It’s very important for pregnant women to get vaccinated,” said lead study author Dr. Nicola Klein of the Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Center in Oakland, California.    “It’s an extremely effective vaccine to protect babies before they are able to get vaccinated on their own,” Klein said in a phone interview.    Health officials in many countries recommend vaccination during pregnancy, as well as a series of three shots for infants starting sometime between 6 weeks and 3 months of age. Some countries also recommend that women get vaccinated during each pregnancy because effectiveness of the shot wanes over time.   Kaiser Permanente, where all the babies in the study were born, started encouraging Tdap vaccinations for pregnant women in 2010 after a whooping cough outbreak in California. In early 2013, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that all pregnant women get the Tdap shot, regardless of whether they previously had received this vaccine.    From 2006 to 2008, before these recommendations came out, less than 1 percent of babies at Kaiser hospitals had mothers who got vaccinated during pregnancy, the study found.    At the start of the study in 2010, about 12 percent of babies had vaccinated mothers. By 2015, 87 percent of infants had vaccinated mothers.    Babies whose mothers got the vaccine during pregnancy had a 69 percent lower risk of whooping cough in their first year of life, even after accounting for the effects of whooping cough vaccines the infants got starting at two months of age, researchers report in Pediatrics.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that the vaccinating pregnant mothers protects babies from whooping cough, the authors note. Because most women who did get shots during pregnancy received them around the same time, the study also can’t help determine the optimal point in pregnancy to vaccinate mothers.    Still, this is the first study to provide very strong evidence that vaccinating pregnant women protects their babies, especially during that critical first two months of life when infants haven’t received their own dose of the vaccine, said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatric infectious disease researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine in California, who wasn’t involved in the study.    In addition, the findings should ease concerns that vaccinating women during pregnancy might make the infants’ vaccinations at two, four and six months less effective, Maldonado said by email.    “This study demonstrated that this was not the case, and in fact there appears to be a benefit from maternal Tdap even after infant immunization,” Maldonado said.    Not all women are getting this vaccine during pregnancy, and if their doctor doesn’t offer it they should ask, said Julie Leask, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney in Australia who wasn’t involved in the study.   “The data further strengthen the case for pregnancy vaccination as the `first dose’ of vaccination in babies,” Leask said by email.

2namXku,2017-03-31,Pharmacy chain works to help curb opioid epidemic," (Reuters Health) - The drugstore chain Walgreens is taking a three-pronged approach to combat the public health crisis stemming from prescription opioids, according to a team of pharmacists and other clinicians from the company.    In the Journal of the American Pharmacists Association, they report that Walgreens pharmacies have expanded access to naloxone, a drug that can block the effects of opioid painkillers such as hydrocodone and oxycodone and thereby prevent overdose deaths from respiratory failure.    In addition, the chain installed medication-disposal kiosks in 500 of its 8,200 U.S. stores to make it easier for Americans to empty their medicine cabinets of unused pharmaceuticals that might otherwise fall into the hands of substance abusers.   Walgreens also has employed pharmacists and students to educate and counsel patients and caregivers about opioid overdoses and naloxone.    By August 2016, the chain had dispensed 10,478 naloxone prescriptions in 49 states, the pharmacists say.   Phil Caruso, a Walgreens spokesman who was not among the authors of the report, said most health insurance plans cover the cost of naloxone - $18.99 in a syringe version and $39.99 for a nasal version.   Emily Shafer, lead author of the report, compares naloxone to the emergency treatment for severe allergic reactions, EpiPen. “It’s important to have it on hand, like (you would have) an EpiPen if someone in your household has a peanut allergy,” she said in a phone interview.   Indeed, in 2014, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder urged federal law enforcement agencies to train first responders to treat overdose victims with naloxone.   Addiction expert Dr. Alexander Walley likened naloxone in the home of an opioid user to a fire extinguisher. “If you have a gas stove, you’re expected to have a fire extinguisher,” he said in a phone interview. “If you have opioids, you should have naloxone.”   Naloxone is safe with no potential for abuse, Walley said. In fact, he added, “It’s the last thing somebody who is opioid tolerant wants because it takes away their high.”   But a mishmash of state laws governing dispensing of naloxone complicates the task of getting the drug to members of the community. As of early this year, the authors write, Walgreens offers naloxone without requiring a prescription in 40 states.   But every state has a unique set of requirements. Consistent laws about naloxone dispensing across the U.S. would help, Shafer said.   Other national pharmacy chains also have instituted programs to combat the opioid epidemic. Walgreens, however, is the only drugstore chain to install drug-disposal kiosks in some of its stores, Caruso said.   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and local law enforcement agencies host regular prescription drug take-back events for safe disposal of prescriptions drugs. The DEA’s next National Take-Back Day will be on Saturday, April 29.   Pharmacies bear some responsibility for the overprescribing of opioids, Walley said.   “For some time now, opioid overdose has been recognized as a public health crisis. We didn’t get pharmacies involved soon enough, and we’re now playing catch-up,” said Walley, a professor at Boston Medical Center.    “Pharmacies are the most widely available health outlets in our communities. The fact that they are explicitly developing a strategy to implement public health measures to prevent overdose is a step,” he said.    Walley was not involved in the new report, but as a volunteer, he has written standing orders that allow Walgreens pharmacists in Massachusetts to dispense naloxone to opioid users who might need it.   U.S. pharmacists fill 650,000 opioid prescriptions every day, “a significant portion . . . due to inappropriate prescribing,” the authors write.    Since 1999, the number of U.S. opioid overdose deaths quadrupled, along with sales of the painkillers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).    Every day, more than 1,000 Americans are treated in emergency rooms for opioid misuse, and 91 die from opioid overdoses, according to the CDC.   The CDC last year released guidelines urging primary-care physicians to dramatically curtail prescribing opioids for chronic pain. The guidelines recommend other, non-addictive medications, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, for chronic pain unless patients have cancer or are receiving palliative or end-of-life care.   The guidelines further suggest that when doctors do prescribe opioid painkillers, they prescribe the lowest possible dose and also prescribe physical therapy, exercise and other non-drug approaches to pain control.

2nnVXxn,2017-03-31,Can grandma help spot autism earlier?," (Reuters Health) - Kids with autism who spend a lot of time with their grandmothers may get diagnosed with the disorder at a younger age, a small study suggests.    “This finding is incredibly important, as these individuals have the potential to lower the age of diagnosis,” senior study author Joseph Buxbaum of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York said by email. “Early diagnosis means early intervention, which is critical for improving treatment outcomes.”   Even though autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be identified starting when kids are around 2 years old, many children are not formally diagnosed until they are closer to 4, the researchers note in the journal Autism. The earlier autism is caught and treated, the better, because younger kids have more adaptable brains that may respond more to therapy than older children.    In the current study, an online survey of parents of children with autism as well as some friends and family members, parents reported about 25 percent of the time that another person close to the child noticed signs of autism first.    Kids in the study were diagnosed with autism when they were about 40 months old on average. When they regularly spent time with their grandmothers, however, they typically were diagnosed about 5 months sooner.    “Around 50 percent of friends and family noticed something was wrong with the child before they were aware that the parents themselves suspected something,” lead study author Nachum Sicherman of Columbia University in New York said by email.    About one in 68 children have autism spectrum disorder, which includes autism as well as Asperger syndrome and other pervasive developmental disorders, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    People with ASD often have problems with social, emotional and communication skills. They might repeat certain behaviors and might not want change in their daily activities. Many people with ASD also have different ways of learning, paying attention, or reacting to things. Symptoms can be less severe with early detection and treatment.    To see how family structure influences when the disorder is caught, researchers examined survey data from 477 parents of children with autism and from 106 close friends and family members.    Children without siblings were diagnosed with autism about six to eight months earlier on average than kids with brothers or sisters living in the household at the time of their diagnosis, the study found.    Birth order also matters. Kids with older siblings get diagnosed about nine to 10 months sooner than children who only have younger brothers and sisters.    When parents said another adult close to the child first identified the possibility of autism, that person was a maternal grandmother 27 percent of the time and a teacher in 24 percent of cases.    Taken together, grandparents on both sides of the family tree noticed the potential for autism before parents did about 59 percent of the time.    The study isn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how family structures and relationships with grandparents or teachers directly impact when autism gets diagnosed.    Another limitation is that the families in the study weren’t representative of the U.S. population; ack people in particular were underrepresented, the authors note.    But the findings suggest that close friends and family members may play a pivotal role in catching autism early, said Norah Johnson, a pediatric nurse practitioner at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Delayed diagnosis tends to be from a lack of ability on the part of parents to make clinicians aware of the child’s social signs of ASD,” Johnson said by email.    It’s not unusual for grandparents who spend a lot of time with kids or provide childcare to detect difficulties that might lead to an autism diagnosis, said Dr. Thomas Frazier, director of the Center for Autism at Cleveland Clinic Children’s in Ohio.    “Parents need to be open to concerns from their family members, including their parents, regarding their children,” Frazier, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “The more eyes the better, and this is especially true in situations where the child with possible difficulties is the older child with younger siblings.”  "
2oHDOvg,2017-03-31,Freestanding ERs may give patients sticker shock," (Reuters Health) - Care at freestanding emergency departments may cost about 10 times more than similar treatment at urgent care centers, according to a Texas study that highlights the potential for patients to be surprised by their bills.    The average cost of care at a freestanding emergency room in Texas was $2,199 in 2015, compared with $168 at urgent care, the study found. Either way, patients had to pay roughly one third of the tab out-of-pocket.    “We think patients may confuse freestanding emergency rooms with urgent care,” said lead study author Vivian Ho of Rice University in Houston.    “In Texas, they are both commonly found in suburban strip malls,” Ho said by email. “When people see a health care facility in that setting, they assume it won’t be as expensive as going to the hospital.”   For the study, Ho and colleagues analyzed insurance claims processed by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas from 2012 to 2015.    While hospital emergency rooms and urgent care clinics accounted for the bulk of these claims, freestanding emergency departments experienced much more growth in use during the study period, researchers report in the Annals of Emergency Medicine.    In 2015, there were 1,046,545 visits to hospital emergency rooms and 926,933 to urgent care clinics, compared with just 183,971 visits to freestanding emergency departments.    During the study period, the number of freestanding emergency departments visited by patients in the database surged from 52 to 207 and the total number of visits jumped by 236 percent, from 54,696.    Prices at urgent care centers only rose 2 percent over the study period, while prices at hospital-based emergency rooms climbed 23 percent and prices at freestanding emergency departments soared 54 percent.    By the end of the study, average prices at hospital emergency rooms were $2,259, or about $60 more than at freestanding emergency departments.    When researchers looked at prices in different settings for the most common conditions treated, they found average prices were much higher at freestanding emergency departments than at urgent care.    For example, treatment for upper respiratory infections cost $1,351 at freestanding emergency rooms and $165 at urgent care clinics. At hospital-based emergency rooms, the price was $1,074.    One limitation of the study is that the severity of diseases or injuries might have varied at the different facilities, the authors note. They also lacked data on the total amount of money patients ultimately paid out-of-pocket for their care.    Another shortcoming is that the study didn’t include patients with other types of insurance including government programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare.    Treating patients with these other types of insurance might bring down the average amounts paid out to hospital emergency rooms because those programs typically reimburse at a lower rate than private insurance, said Dr. Erin Simon, a researcher at Cleveland Clinic Akron General in Ohio who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Independent freestanding emergency departments are not able to bill those patients and must absorb those costs, and neither of those factors are addressed in this study,” Simon said by email.    Freestanding emergency departments may offer better access to care because they’re often located closer to where patients live and can cut travel time in emergencies, noted Dr. Nitish Patidar, a researcher at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut who wasn’t involved in the study.    In some emergencies, patients might need to be transferred to a hospital, but the quality of care should generally be similar between freestanding emergency departments and hospital-based emergency rooms, Patidar said.    Patients do need to know when to try urgent care and when to visit emergency rooms, said Dr. Benjamin Lawner, medical director of prehospital care services for LifeFlight and EMS at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.    “Urgent care centers are most suitable for convenience type of care,” Lawner said by email. “If a patient has a sore throat, cough, cold, or laceration, the urgent care center represents an accessible and efficient means of care,” he said.   “For possible life threatening situations such as chest pain, trouble breathing, weakness or significant injury, I’d recommend a freestanding emergency department or hospital emergency department,” Lawner added.

2nYYC0X,2017-03-31,"Overweight, obese young men at increased risk of liver disease"," (Reuters Health) - Young men who are overweight or obese have up to double the risk of normal-weight peers for developing liver disease later in life, a large study in Sweden suggests.   If the young men also had type 2 diabetes, their risk of having liver disease by the time they reached middle age was as much as 3.3 times higher, researchers report in the journal Gut.     Past studies have shown that diabetes raises risk for liver disease and liver cancer, but the current study indicates that having a high body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height, is a risk factor on its own.   “A high BMI early in life in men is associated with an increased risk of developing severe liver disease later in life, and this cannot be explained by a high alcohol consumption or viral hepatitis,” lead study author Dr. Hannes Hagstrom told Reuters Health by email.   “Also, this risk was highly increased in those men who contracted type 2 diabetes during the follow-up, independent of the baseline BMI,” said Hagstrom, a researcher with the Center for Digestive Diseases at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm.   The study team analyzed records for 1,220,261 men who had physicals when they were drafted into the Swedish army between 1969 and 1996 and were 17 to 19 years old at the time. Using national health registries, the researchers followed the men until 2012.    They grouped men according to BMI, which is measured as kilograms per square meter. Normally, a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered a healthy weight, while 25 to 29.9 is overweight, 30 or above is obese and 40 or higher is what’s known as morbidly obese. In the current study, researchers reduced the healthy range to BMIs between 18.5 and 22.5, and used men in that group as the basis for comparisons with all the others.     When the men were drafted, the average BMI was 21.5, and just 100,000 men were in the overweight range and 20,000 qualified as obese. But rates of obesity differed across the original enlistment period, the researchers note. In 1969, about 6 percent of men were overweight and less than 1 percent were obese, but by 1996, 12 percent of young men were overweight and almost 3 percent were obese.    Over the follow-up period, 5,281 men developed severe liver diseases, including cirrhosis and liver failure, and 251 were diagnosed with liver cancer.    When compared to men with BMIs less than 22.5 at baseline, the risk of severe liver disease increased as BMIs went up: men in the overweight category had about 50 percent increased risk of liver disease and obese men had a two-fold increased risk. Excluding men with a diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease from the analysis raised the risk associated with obesity slightly higher still.    “Although we cannot know for sure, we speculate that these men had or developed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and that this in some cases led to severe liver disease,” Hagstrom said.   When they looked at liver cancer, the researchers found that men who were overweight at baseline had about a 60 percent increase in risk, while the risk was more than tripled for men who were obese.   Hagstrom said physicians should know overweight and obese teenage boys are at an increased risk for future severe liver disease, and that intervention early in life likely is necessary to reduce this risk.    “Obesity is an important risk factor for a number of types of cancer. Liver cancer is one of those,” Karen Basen-Engquist told Reuters Health.   “This study shows that even obesity in early adulthood is associated with later risk. It’s important for us to try to maintain a healthy weight all through our lives,” said Basen-Engquist, director of the University of Texas MD Anderson’s Center for Energy Balance in Cancer Prevention and Survivorship in Houston.   Basen-Engquist, who was not involved in the study, said doctors and researchers need to keep getting that message out because a lot of people aren’t aware of the link between obesity and cancer. “A lot of people know about smoking and cancer, but they don’t think about obesity and cancer risk.”   "
2kX4fQk,2017-03-30,More evidence linking stress to obesity," (Reuters Health) - Using hair to measure long-term levels of the stress hormone cortisol, UK researchers confirm the link between chronic stress and packing on pounds, as well as difficulty shedding excess weight.    Previous research has tied high levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the blood, urine or saliva to obesity, but these measurements can vary based on factors like the time of day and don’t capture long-term stress levels, the study team notes in the journal Obesity.    “When people are facing a stressful situation, a chain reaction is set off in the body that results in the release of cortisol, leading to higher levels of this hormone in the body,” said lead study author Sarah Jackson of University College London.    “Cortisol is involved in a broad range of biological processes, including metabolism, body composition and the accumulation of body fat,” Jackson said by email. “When we’re stressed out we may also find it more difficult to find the motivation to go for a run or resist unhealthy foods.”   Stress sets off alarms in the brain that trigger the nervous system to release hormones to sharpen the senses, tense the muscles, speed up the pulse and deepen breathing. Commonly called a flight or flight response, this biological reaction helps us defend ourselves in threatening situations.   Isolated or temporary stressful situations may not be harmful, but routine exposure to stress can lead to immune system problems, heart disease, nervous system complications and mental health disorders in addition to obesity.   For the study researchers examined data collected from men and women aged 54 and older taking part in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Participants underwent tests every two years starting in 2002, and during the sixth wave of the study they provided a hair clipping.    The study team tested cortisol levels that accumulated in the hair over time in 2,527 men and women and found that participants with more cortisol in their hair were also more likely to be obese or have lots of excess fat around their midsection.    Researchers looked at cortisol levels in the two centimeters of hair closest to the scalp, which typically represents about two months’ growth. They also looked at weight, waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height.     Participants who were classified as obese based on their BMI or waist circumference had particularly high levels of hair cortisol, the study found. Analyzing weight and body fat data from assessments in the four years prior to when the hair clipping was taken, researchers also found that obesity tended to persist over time for the people with the highest cortisol levels.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how stress directly impacts cortisol levels or weight gain.    Other limitations include the primarily white, older adult study population, which means results may be different with younger people or other racial or ethnic groups, the authors note.    Even so, the findings add to growing evidence linking stress to obesity, said Dr. Susan Fried, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.   Cortisol is released in response to many stresses, Fried, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. Chronically high cortisol is thought to promote fat accumulation around the waist and increase the ability of fat cells to store fat.    The fix for stressed out people looking to shed excess pounds isn’t clear from the study results, however.    “I don’t think there is strong evidence or consistent studies showing stress reduction itself causes weight loss,” Fried said. “There is accumulating evidence that sleep is very important; people overeat when under-rested.”   The findings do suggest that people may need to take a holistic approach to weight loss that goes beyond diet and exercise to consider factors like stress, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center in New Haven, Connecticut.    “You might think you need to improve your diet, or exercise more, and that’s true,” Katz, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “But for you, the first priority might be to manage stress better so you are more capable of doing those things, and reduce a hormonal barrier to weight control into the bargain.”  "
2mCwpkn,2017-03-30,HPV vaccination during pregnancy shows no ill effects," (Reuters Health) - New evidence from a Danish nationwide study suggests that Merck and Co, Inc’s quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), marketed as Gardasil, is not dangerous in the unusual case when it is inadvertently given during early pregnancy.   Among 1,665 women exposed to the Gardasil vaccine while pregnant, there was no increased risk of having a child with a major birth defect compared to 6,660 women not exposed during pregnancy.   The analysis also showed no elevated risk for spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, low birthweight, stillbirth or having a child who is small for gestational age.    “Before our study, very little was known about the safety of HPV vaccination in pregnancy,” coauthor Dr. Anders Hviid told Reuters Health in an email. “The lesson is that for young women who are inadvertently vaccinated early in pregnancy there is no need to worry; our results do not support that this exposure has an adverse effect on the unborn baby.”   And for now, “HPV vaccines should still not be administered in pregnancy,” said Hviid, a senior investigator in the department of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institute in Copenhagen.   “The study doesn’t cover all bases, but what it generally says is very positive news,” Dr. Robert Burk of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “As far as they can measure in a large population, there seems not to be a major detectable detrimental effect of the HPV vaccine. It’s kind of what we anticipated, but the news is as good as you’re going to get about a vaccine.”   The study did not look at the safety of the bivalent version of the vaccine that covers fewer strains of HPV.   More than 72 million women and girls worldwide have received HPV vaccines, which are designed to protect against cervical and other cancers. The vaccine is recommended for women aged 9 to 26 but not during pregnancy.   However, women who are pregnant but don’t yet realize it are sometimes vaccinated.    “It’s not that uncommon,” said Burk, a professor of microbiology, immunology, epidemiology and population health who was not involved in the study. “You’re immunizing women in their reproductive window when a good chunk of women are getting pregnant.”   One previous analysis that pooled data from two studies reported an elevated spontaneous abortion rate among women who got pregnant within 90 days of vaccination with the bivalent HPV vaccine, but other research has called that finding into question.   The new study, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, looked at all pregnant women in Denmark using several national registries. The data included the years 2006 to 2013.   Instances of spontaneous abortion within the first six weeks of pregnancy were not included, the authors write, because many cases of spontaneous abortion during the first weeks of gestation may go unrecognized.   Although the raw data did suggest higher rates of low birth weight, preterm birth and major birth defects, vaccinated women were also more likely to be smokers, unmarried and have both lower incomes and lower levels of education, putting them at higher risk for those outcomes in the first place.   Once the research team adjusted for those factors, they found no significant difference in risk for women who got the vaccine while pregnant.  "
2lmoJQV,2017-03-30,Chemical disinfectants and sanitizers linked to thyroid cancer," (Reuters Health) - Workers exposed to chemicals like deodorizers, sanitizers, disinfectants and sterilizers on the job may be more likely than other people to develop thyroid cancer, a recent study suggests.    Occupational exposure to these chemicals, known as biocides, was associated with a 65 percent higher risk of thyroid cancer, the study found. For people whose jobs might have led to the most cumulative exposure to biocides over time, the odds of thyroid cancer was more than doubled.    The study also looked at pesticides, and didn’t find an increased risk of thyroid cancer linked to these agricultural chemicals.    “Limited studies have investigated occupational exposure to pesticides in relation to thyroid cancer and have reached inconsistent results,” said lead study author Dr. Yawei Zhang, an environmental health researcher at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.    “Our study did not support an association between occupational exposure to pesticides and risk of thyroid cancer, but suggested that occupational exposure to other biocides might be associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer,” Zhang said by email.    Scientists aren’t certain what causes thyroid cancer, though the odds of these malignancies are higher with certain genetic disorders and with exposure to high amounts of radiation, especially during childhood.    Women are much more likely to get thyroid tumors than men, and this type of cancer is more common in white people than in other racial or ethnic groups.    For the current study, researchers compared data on 462 adults with thyroid cancer in 2010 and 2011 to 498 people who didn’t get these tumors but who were otherwise similar and around the same age.    Researchers asked study participants to report all jobs held for at least one year during their lifetimes and to provide detailed information on their job title, duties, company name, type of industry and dates of employment.    Then, researchers calculated potential exposure to biocides and pesticides based on a state database of occupational contact with specific chemicals and pollutants.    Pesticides included primarily agricultural chemicals like insecticides, herbicides and rodenticides. The jobs most often linked to these chemicals were farmer, rancher and other agricultural managers; postal worker; and supervisor of landscaping, lawn services and grounds keeping workers.    Biocides in the study were typically used in medicine or cleaning. Jobs most often tied to these chemicals included healthcare providers involved in diagnosing or treating patients; psychiatric and home health aides; and building cleaning workers.    Women with any occupational exposure to biocides were 48 percent more likely to develop thyroid cancer, while men had more than tripled odds, the study found.    Although the underlying mechanisms linking biocides to thyroid cancer are unclear, it’s possible that these chemicals alter thyroid hormones, researchers note. Triclosan, for example, a chemical widely used in cleaning products, has been shown to decrease levels of two thyroid hormones involved in growth and metabolism.    Another chemical, the wood preservative pentachlorophenol, has been show to lower thyroid hormone levels in rats, the authors also point out.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove biocides or pesticides directly cause thyroid cancer.    Other limitations include the five-year age bands researchers used to compare people with thyroid tumors to similar healthy individuals. It’s also possible the state data on occupational chemical exposure might not always reflect the level of exposure to certain biocides or pesticides by individual people in the study.    But the findings suggest it makes sense for people to be cautious about biocide and pesticide exposure, researchers conclude.    “People should take caution when they apply pesticides or other biocides in work place or at home by wearing protective clothes or mask and washing hands afterwards,” Zhang said.   "
2octnE0,2017-03-30,Firearm-related hospitalizations cost U.S. billions," (Reuters Health) - Just the initial hospitalizations for firearm-related injuries in the United States cost an average $735 million per year, with the government picking up a large portion of the tab, researchers say.   Medicaid and Medicare pay 41 percent of the total, and private insurers another 20 percent, the study authors report in American Journal of Public Health.   “Firearm-related injuries are at the heart of one of the most heated political discussions in the United States, yet there is surprisingly little scientific research available on the subject,” said lead study author Sarabeth Spitzer of the Stanford University School of Medicine in California.   “It is important for all parties involved in these discussions to have a clear understanding of the monetary cost of these injuries and where the financial burden falls,” she told Reuters Health by email.   In 2014, firearms caused about 33,700 deaths and 81,000 nonfatal injuries in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. homicide rate is seven times higher than that of other developed countries, and the gun homicide rate is 25 times higher, Spitzer and her co-authors note.   To get a conservative estimate of the costs of firearm injuries, the researchers analyzed data from the largest U.S. database of inpatient hospital care. They focused on emergency treatment of firearm injuries that led to hospital admission, excluding readmissions for an older injury or patients who were treated but not admitted.    Between 2006 and 2014, about 267,000 patients were admitted for firearm-related injuries, and inflation-adjusted costs totaled $6.61 billion. Average costs per admission ranged from $19,600 for self-pay patients to $30,900 for Medicaid patients.    “This study underestimates the true cost of firearm-related injuries as it includes only the first inpatient admission cost,” Spitzer said. “It excludes many other important and costly steps in patient treatment such as emergency department care, readmission, rehabilitation, long-term health care and disability.”   The injury patients were overwhelmingly male across all payer groups. Patients insured by Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for the poor, stayed in the hospital for an average three days longer than others and had injuries that were more likely to have been caused by assault.    Patients covered by Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people over age 65, were more likely to have self-inflicted injuries and privately-insured patients had more unintentional injuries.    About 43 percent of all hospital admissions were in the South, which also had the highest proportion of self-pay patients. The Northeast had the lowest proportion of admissions with 16 percent.   Of the inflation-adjusted $6.6 billion costs during the study period, Medicaid paid $2.3 billion, or 34.8 percent; Medicare paid $0.4 billion, or 6 percent; private insurers paid $1.32 billion, or 34.8 percent; and self-pay individuals paid $1.56 billion or 23.6 percent.    “We’re an outlier nation in terms of gun problems, and this only looks at a small part of the expense,” said David Hemenway of Harvard University in Boston who wasn’t involved with the study.   The study doesn’t include costs related to long-term issues such as spinal cord injuries and traumatic brain injury, as well as social or job-related costs, such as unemployment, sick leave and psychological impact on loved ones, noted Hemenway, who directs the Harvard Injury Control Research Center.    “It doesn’t even begin to account for the real costs of losing a relative, spouse or community member,” he added. “Gun violence makes it impossible to live a good life in some of these places, especially when industry doesn’t want to move in and people are afraid to go out.”   As the first study to quantify firearm-related costs in about a decade, the data could have major implications for public policy changes and healthcare funding, said Konstantinos Economopoulos of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the research. In the past 30 years of funding from the National Institutes of Health, for example, six awards have supported firearm-injury studies, he said.    “The financial burden . . . falls mainly on the shoulders of the government (through Medicaid) and the uninsured,” he told Reuters Health by email. “There is an ethical - but also financial - imperative need for an increase in funding for future research to tackle the ongoing epidemic of firearm-related injuries.”  "
2mBgBKW,2017-03-29,Are any fad diets good for heart health?," (Reuters Health) - It may be tempting to latch on to the latest diet fad like juicing or going gluten-free to lose weight or achieve other health goals. But when it comes to heart health, doctors say sticking with old standbys like fruits, veggies and olive oil is still the best approach.    To see what kind of diet patterns might be the most heart healthy, a team of doctors and researchers examined results from more than a dozen previously published nutrition studies. Taken together, all of this evidence shows the best regimen for heart health includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and legumes, the study concludes.    “There is a great amount of misinformation about nutrition fads, including antioxidant pills, juicing and gluten-free diets,” said lead study author Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness in the division of cardiology at National Jewish Health in Denver.   “However, there are number of dietary patterns that have clearly been demonstrated to reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, including coronary heart disease,” Freeman said in a statement. “There is growing consensus that a predominantly plant-based diet that emphasizes green, leafy vegetables, whole grains, legumes and fruit is where the best improvements are seen in heart health.”   Based on the scientific data available, nuts in moderation, extra-virgin olive oil and lean meats can also be part of a heart healthy diet, Freeman and colleagues report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.    To help avoid high cholesterol, one risk factor for heart disease, the study authors also recommend skipping or limiting eggs and other oils like coconut and palm oil.    Even though U.S. dietary guidelines released last year removed previous recommendations to limit cholesterol, the current research review still advises against eating too many eggs because they are associated with higher cholesterol levels in the blood.    Coconut oil and palm oil may be trendy, but there isn’t much data to show they’re healthy for routine use, the study also concludes. Olive oil does have proven benefits, but should be consumed in moderation because it’s high in calories.    When it comes to antioxidants, another diet fad, there’s no evidence that supplements can help the heart and some evidence that they may have harmful health effects. But the science does support eating whole fruits and vegetables to get these nutrients.    Juicing, too, may not be as good for the heart as whole fruits and vegetables if people end up drinking too many calories, the researchers note. Juices without added sugar may, however, make sense for people who don’t eat enough fruits and vegetables.    “The problem with juicing is that many individuals who drink these tend to consume more calories from added sugars (fruit, yogurt, milk) than they realize,” Dr. Daniel Rader of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia said by email. He wasn’t involved in the study.    Gluten-free diets that avoid ingredients like wheat, barley and rye are necessary for people with celiac disease or gluten allergies, but don’t have proven benefits for anyone else, the study concludes.    It’s possible that fad diets avoiding gluten without a medical reason to do this might appear to be successful because people who try eating this way to improve their health also do other things that are healthy like getting plenty of exercise and sleep and avoiding smoking and junk food, said Alvaro Hernaez, a researcher at the Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute in Barcelona.    “They feel better because of the general improvement in their lifestyle habits,” Hernaez, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Fads diets, especially those that load up on meat or restrict too much food, should be avoided, said Samantha Heller, a nutritionist at New York University Langone Medical Center who wasn’t involved in the study.    “We would all benefit from eating fewer foods that come from animals such as ham, beef, cheese, butter and pork, and eating a lot more plant foods,” Heller said by email.   "
2oykoJb,2017-03-29,Estrogen for osteoporosis tied to lower risk of gum infections," (Reuters Health) - - After menopause, women who take estrogen therapy may be less likely to develop severe oral health problems than peers who don’t take hormones or other treatments for age-related bone damage, a recent study suggests.    During menopause and afterward, the body slows production of new bone tissue and women face an increased risk of osteoporosis. Falling levels of the hormone estrogen around menopause can contribute to fragile, brittle bones associated with both osteoporosis and periodontal disease, or infections around the teeth and gums.   For the current study, researchers examined data on 492 women in Bahia, Brazil, who had gone through menopause and had bone density scans between 2009 and 2011. The group included 113 women treating osteoporosis with calcium and vitamin D supplements, or with estrogen alone or in combination with the hormone progestin.    Overall, the rate of severe periodontitis - when the inner layer of gums pull away from the teeth - was 44 percent lower among the women taking estrogen for osteoporosis, the study found.    “I imagine that a patient who forgoes osteoporosis treatment with estrogen because of its risks is unlikely to change her mind after learning there is a potential connection to periodontal disease,” said Natalia Chalmers, director of analytics at the DentaQuest Institute in Westborough, Massachusetts.    “But if she is already predisposed to severe periodontitis, it is important for her to know how osteoporosis may make her condition worse,” Chalmers, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Risks of estrogen therapy can include increased odds of heart disease and breast cancer, Johelle de S. Passos-Soares of the Federal University of Bahia in Brazil and colleagues note in the Journal Menopause. Passos-Soares didn’t respond to requests for comment on the study.    Periodontitis is a leading cause of tooth loss in older adults. As gums pull away from the teeth, debris collects in the mouth that can become infected and plaque can spread below the gum line. In severe cases so much gum tissue and bone are destroyed that teeth become loose and fall out.    Women in the study were 61 years old on average, and ranged in age from 50 to 87. They typically when through menopause when they were around 47 years old.    Women treating osteoporosis averaged about 9 missing teeth, 8 decayed teeth and 2 teeth with fillings or restorations. They were also more likely than women not treating osteoporosis to have visited a dentist within the past two years.   With estrogen treatments, fewer women had periodontal disease, which researchers defined as gaps at least 5 millimeters deep between the gums and the jaw around at least 30 percent of teeth. But the difference from women not using estrogen was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    However, osteoporosis treatment was associated with fewer cases of severe periodontitis and significantly fewer teeth that had gaps at least 4 millimeters deep between the gums and the teeth.    The study isn’t a controlled experiment designed to show whether estrogen treatment after menopause directly prevents gum disease or severe periodontitis.   Limitations of the study include the fact that researchers looked at women at a single point in time, so they couldn’t determine when the women developed oral health problems relative to when they went through menopause or started estrogen treatments. Women in the study were also recruited from a health center, making it possible the findings might be different in a broader population of patients, researchers note.    It’s also possible that women who seek routine care for one aspect of their health may be more likely to get treatment for other health issues, Chalmers said. That means the connection between osteoporosis treatment and women seeking more preventive care in general might explain a lower risk of periodontal disease.    “The link between osteoporosis and periodontal disease is not clear, and more studies are needed to fully assess this connection,” Chalmers said. “However, we can say that patients affected by each condition share risk factors such as age, smoking, hormonal change and genetics, as well as calcium and vitamin D deficiency.”  "
2nsxk5z,2017-03-29,Campus environment tied to sexual assault risk for LGBT people," (Reuters Health) - College students in the U.S. who say their campus is welcoming to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are less likely to be victims of sexual assaults at school, a new study suggests.   The researchers found that students who perceived their campus as an inclusive environment for LGBT people were significantly less likely to be the victims of sexual assault.   “I believe this study provides proof of concept for how environment may influence sexual assault violence,” said lead author Robert Coulter, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health.   Coulter and colleagues write in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence that sexual assault affects 2 to 15 percent of U.S. undergraduates.   In earlier research, they found that certain groups are more at risk of sexual assault than others. For example, women and transgender people in general are at greater risk of sexual assault than non-transgender men.   To see whether campus environment is tied to the risk of sexual assault, the researchers analyzed survey data collected in 2010 from 1,925 undergraduates who were LGBT or questioning their sexual orientation.   Overall, 5.2 percent reported that they had been sexually assaulted on campus.   The odds of having experienced sexual assault were 27 percent lower for students who reported that LGBT people were welcomed at their campus than for those who felt their campus was less inclusive.   Similarly, people who had not witnessed LGBT-related harassment on campus were 32 percent less likely to report that they’d been sexually assaulted, compared to those who did see such harassment, but this finding could have been due to chance.   The researchers suggest several reasons why a campus environment that’s welcoming to LGBT people may be tied to reduced odds of sexual assault.   For one, people on those campuses may feel empowered to stop assaults and ultimately reduce their prevalence. Additionally, LGBT people on those campuses may feel empowered to be more defensive against assaults.   “There are great disparities of sexual assault victimization for LGBT people and we need to find ways to reduce their greater risk,” Coulter told Reuters Health.   So far, the researchers write, no programs that aim to prevent sexual assault have been tested among LGBT people.   “I think designing interventions to reduce sexual assault victimization for LGBT people is important,” Coulter said.   The researchers point out that this study can’t prove that inclusive campus environments cause fewer assaults on LGBT people. People who don’t experience sexual assaults may perceive the campus environment differently than those who do, they add.  "
2mNsT1W,2017-03-28,"Delirium in critically ill children common, may go undetected"," (Reuters Health) - About a quarter of children admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) will develop delirium, according to the first large international study to assess how common the condition is in critically ill children.   The prevalence of delirium nearly doubles after five days in a pediatric ICU, underscoring the need for routine monitoring of children for it, researchers say.      “(The condition) is more common and more widespread than previously recognized,” Dr. Chani Traube, a pediatric intensivist from Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian in New York City, said in a statement. “Monitoring children for the development of delirium should be a routine part of the care we provide, just as we monitor children for the development of fevers when they are sick.”    “We need increased awareness about delirium in children in the ICU in order to detect it early and treat it. It’s much easier to treat early delirium than it is to treat delirium that has been entrenched for several days,” Traube noted in an interview with Reuters Health.    There is a large body of research about delirium in adult ICU patients, but far less in pediatric critical care, she said.    Traube and her colleagues did their study at 25 pediatric ICUs in the United States, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Nurses at these sites screened 994 children for delirium with a test called the Cornell Assessment for Pediatric Delirium (CAPD).    Using this rapid bedside tool, delirium status could be established in 835 cases, or 84 percent, according to the results in Critical Care Medicine. Of the children whose status could be determined, 209 screened positive for delirium, 13 percent were classified as comatose and 62 percent were delirium-free and coma-free.    The duration of children’s stays in the pediatric ICU ranged from two to nine days, with an average of six.    Delirium rates increased markedly after day five in the ICU, the study found. For children in the ICU for less than six days, 20 percent experienced delirium. For those who were in the ICU for six or more days, delirium prevalence was 38 percent, “which was really eye-opening for me,” Traube said.   The prevalence of delirium varied significantly with reason for ICU stay, with the highest delirium rates (42 percent) found in children admitted with an infectious or inflammatory disorder.    Other factors independently associated with delirium included age younger than 2 years, mechanical ventilation, use of benzodiazepines or narcotics, use of physical restraints and exposure to blood pressure or antiepileptic drugs.    “There is significant opportunity for improvement in the ICU environment and in our prescribing practices within that initial five day period that might lead to a decrease in the emergence of delirium,” Traube said.   “There absolutely are children that are higher risk for developing delirium from the get-go; upon admission to the ICU they can be identified and there are ICU practices that further contribute to delirium,” she said.   This study supports the feasibility of using CAPD to screen for delirium in the pediatric ICU, the researchers conclude in their report.    “Most of the ICUs participating in our study don’t routinely screen for delirium, and they were able to do so without much difficulty in nearly all their patients,” Traube said in her statement. “You don’t need to buy expensive equipment or do extensive training.”  "
2nYdO2a,2017-03-27,Lesbian and bisexual girls more likely than other teens to smoke," (Reuters Health) - Lesbian, gay and bisexual adolescents report higher rates of tobacco use than heterosexual teens, according to a U.S. study that also highlights gender differences in smoking habits.    Overall, about 41 percent of lesbian and gay teens use tobacco products including both traditional and e-cigarettes, as do 39 percent of bisexual youth and 32 percent of adolescents who are uncertain about their sexual orientation, the study found. That compares to 30 percent of heterosexual teens.    Lesbians were more than twice as likely as straight girls to smoke, the study also found. Gay teens, however, had roughly the same odds of tobacco use as heterosexual boys.    “Gender does matter in tobacco use among sexual minority youth,” said lead study author Dr. Hongying Dai of Children’s Mercy Hospital and the University of Missouri in Kansas City.    While some previous research has found teens who aren’t heterosexual tend to be more drawn to smoking than their straight peers, the current study offers fresh insight into how both gender and sexual orientation may separately influence tobacco use, Dai said by email.    For the study, researcher examined nationally representative survey data collected from 14,703 adolescents in high school in 2015.    Most of the participants were heterosexual, while 6 percent were bisexual, 2 percent were gay or lesbian and about 3 percent said they weren’t sure about their sexual identity.    The survey looked at how often youth used four types of tobacco products over the previous month: cigars, snuff or chewing tobacco, traditional cigarettes, and e-cigarettes, which are battery-powered gadgets with a heating element that turns liquid nicotine and flavorings into a cloud of vapor that users inhale.    Gay and lesbian teens, as well as youth uncertain about their sexual orientation, or “questioning,” were more likely than their straight peers to use all four types of tobacco products, researchers report in Pediatrics.    Bisexual teens, a predominantly female group, were more likely than heterosexual youth to use cigarettes, cigars and e-cigarettes but less likely to use snuff.    The results highlight the need for tobacco control policies that specifically target youth who aren’t heterosexual, the authors conclude.    Limitations of the study include the lack of data on transgender teens and the exclusion of youth who dropped out of high school, the researchers point out. The study also counted any amount of tobacco use the same way, so it didn’t separate teens who reported trying one cigarette from youth with a daily smoking habit.    It also wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether sexual orientation directly influences tobacco use.    “Sexual orientation is not the cause of the smoking disparities; the stigma of being LGBTQ is the problem,” said Michele Eliason, a researcher at San Francisco State University who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Many youth fear rejection by family and peers and hide their sexuality,” Eliason said by email. “This is very stressful and smoking is used as a form of stress release.”   It’s also possible that some lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer/questioning (LGBTQ) teens may be open about their sexuality and engaged in LGBTQ communities, where they find more acceptance for smoking and drug use, Eliason added. When teens have a social support network with other smokers, they are more likely to start smoking themselves.    Providing a strong support system at home can make a difference, said Heather Corliss, a public health researcher at San Diego State University who wasn’t involved in the study.    “The most important thing parents can do is to support their teens unconditionally and without judgment. This recommendation applies to parents of all teens regardless of their sexual orientation,” Corliss said by email.   “Teens who have a strong attachment to a parent are less likely to use tobacco than those who are less connected to their family,” she added. “Parents should foster strong relationships with their teens, while at the same time maintaining consistent rules and limits.”  "
2mRVepg,2017-03-27,Would legalizing medical marijuana help curb the opioid epidemic?," (Reuters Health) - In states that legalized medical marijuana, U.S. hospitals failed to see a predicted influx of pot smokers, but in an unexpected twist, they treated far fewer opioid users, a new study shows.   Hospitalization rates for opioid painkiller dependence and abuse dropped on average 23 percent in states after marijuana was permitted for medicinal purposes, the analysis found. Hospitalization rates for opioid overdoses dropped 13 percent on average.    At the same time, fears that legalization of medical marijuana would lead to an uptick in cannabis-related hospitalizations proved unfounded, according to the report in Drug and Alcohol Dependence.   “Instead, medical marijuana laws may have reduced hospitalizations related to opioid pain relievers,” said study author Yuyan Shi, a public health professor at the University of California, San Diego.   “This study and a few others provided some evidence regarding the potential positive benefits of legalizing marijuana to reduce opioid use and abuse, but they are still preliminary,” she said in an email.   Dr. Esther Choo, a professor of emergency medicine at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, was intrigued by the study’s suggestion that access to cannabis might reduce opioid misuse.    “It is becoming increasingly clear that battling the opioid epidemic will require a multi-pronged approach and a good deal of creativity,” Choo, who was not involved in the study, said in an email. “Could increased liberalization of marijuana be part of the solution? It seems plausible.”   However, she said, “there is still much we need to understand about the mechanisms through which marijuana policy may affect opioid use and harms.”    An estimated 60 percent of Americans now live in the 28 states and Washington, D.C. where medical marijuana is legal under state law.   Meanwhile, the opioid epidemic - sparked by a quadrupling since 1999 in sales of prescription painkillers such as Oxycontin and Vicodin - kills 91 Americans a day.    Shi analyzed hospitalization records from 1997 through 2014 for 27 states, nine of which implemented medical marijuana policies. Her study was the fifth to show declines in opioid use or deaths in states that allow medical cannabis.   Previous studies reported associations between medical marijuana and reductions in opioid prescriptions, opioid-related vehicle accidents and opioid-overdose deaths.   In a 2014 study, Dr. Marcus Bachhuber found deaths from opioid overdoses fell by 25 percent in states that legalized medical marijuana.   Since last year, when New York rolled out its medical marijuana program, Bachhuber has included cannabis in a menu of options he offers his patients who suffer chronic or severe pain from neuropathy and HIV/AIDS, he said in a phone interview. Bachhuber, a professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, was not involved in the new study.    Many of Bachhuber’s patients ask for help quitting highly addictive opioids, and some have used marijuana to taper off the prescription painkillers, he said.   Nonetheless, a 1970 federal law puts cannabis in the same category as heroin, Schedule 1 of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, and finds it has no medicinal value. Consequently, doctors can only recommend, not prescribe, marijuana, and physicians who work for the federal government cannot even discuss the weed.    Federal prohibition also has led to severe limitations on marijuana research.   In January, a National Academies report found conclusive or substantial evidence that cannabis can effectively treat chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and spasticity. The report, written by an independent panel of medical experts, found no evidence of cannabis overdose deaths.    It did, however, find links between cannabis use and an increased risk of vehicle accidents as well as the development of schizophrenia or other psychoses, particularly among the most frequent users.    Bachhuber lamented the dearth of research on the best ways to use marijuana as medicine.    “We have information that it works based on the National Academies’ report,” he said. “But we don’t know who it works best for, at what dosage, for how long.”   Last week, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the nation’s top cop, reiterated his concerns about marijuana and heroin, an illegal opioid.   “I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana,” he told law enforcement officers in Virginia, “so people can trade one life-wrecking dependency for another.”   "
2mZwyK2,2017-03-24,Opioid abuse tied to higher suicide risk in veterans," While drug and alcohol problems are associated with a higher risk of suicide among veterans, the increased danger is particularly high with opioid abuse, a U.S. study suggests.    Overall, male veterans with drug or alcohol problems are more than twice as likely to die by suicide as other ex-service members, researchers report in the journal Addiction. For female veterans with substance use disorders, the odds of death from suicide are almost six times higher.    The suicide risk is particularly high when veterans misuse prescription sedatives, with more than quadrupled odds of suicide for men and more than 11 times the risk for women, the study also found. Among female veterans, opioids were also tied to a nearly eight-times-higher risk of suicide, while amphetamines and stimulants were tied to almost six times the risk.   “Previous studies have linked substance use disorders with an increased risk of suicide in both general population and Veteran samples; however, because suicide is a relatively rare outcome, prior studies have tended to group substance use disorders into broad categories,” said lead study author Kipling Bohnert of the VA Center for Clinical Management Research and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.   “Our investigation is one of the first to provide estimates of the suicide risk associated with cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine and sedative use disorders in the same large population, and compare risks associated with these specific substance use disorders between men and women,” Bohnert said by email.    For the study, researchers examined medical data and death records for more than 4.4 million veterans who received care through the Veterans Health Administration in 2004 and 2005. They followed veterans for six years.    At the start of the study, 8.3 percent of men and 3.4 percent of women had a substance use disorder.    During the study, 9,087 veterans died by suicide, for a suicide rate of 34.7 cases per 100,000 person-years.    For veterans with a substance use problem, the overall suicide rate was 75.6 cases per 100,000 person years. Men had a slightly higher rate of 76.1 cases, while women had a lower rate overall of 63.4 cases per 100,000 person-years.    Two-thirds of the suicides involved firearms, and another one-quarter were by intentional poisoning, the study found.    After researchers accounted for veterans’ age and the severity of any medical conditions, the increased risk of suicide associated with substance abuse diminished somewhat but remained meaningful in most cases.    Once researchers also factored in mental health diagnoses, however, the findings changed. Differences between men and women diminished, and only alcohol and opioid misuse remained associated with an elevated suicide risk for female veterans.    One limitation of the study is that it only included VA patients, who tend to have poorer physical and mental health than other veterans, the authors note. Because the cause of death for suicides is often classified as an accidental overdose, it’s also possible that the study might have underestimated the odds of suicide for certain substance use disorders, the researchers point out.    “We knew that a diagnosis of a substance use disorder increased risk for suicide, but this paper illustrates that not all substance use disorders are the same,” said Rajeev Ramchand, a researcher in military mental health and suicide prevention at Rand Corporation who wasn’t involved in the study.   “There is an opiate crisis in America, including among our veterans, and this paper provides evidence that opiate addiction and suicide are strongly linked,” Ramchand said by email.    For veterans in particular, the transition from military to civilian life and problems with finances, housing, or spouses can be stressful circumstances that may make substance use or suicide attempts more likely, said Yu-Chu Shen, a researcher at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “In addition, clinicians should be aware that deployments may increase suicide risk independently of underlying mental disorders, and so asking patients about deployment history is advisable,” Shen said by email. “Substance use disorder is not the only psychiatric condition associated with elevated risk of suicide - other psychiatric disorders and any previous attempts of suicide are major markers.”  "
2n1TTeX,2017-03-24,‘Low content’ claims on food labels may confuse consumers," Food labels that say ‘low salt’ or ‘no fat’ may be misleading, suggests a new study.   These ‘low-content’ claims are based on comparisons with other foods and are not standard definitions. Making such a claim doesn’t necessarily mean the food is more nutritious than other brands, the authors say.    Consumers should “turn the package around and look at the entire nutritional profile as well as the ingredients list in order to get a better sense of whether the product overall is healthier or less healthy,” Lindsey Smith Taillie of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill told Reuters Health in a phone call.   Smith Taillie and colleagues analyzed data on more than 80 million food and beverage purchases made in the United States by 40,000 families from 2008 to 2012.    “We found that higher-income households tended to be more likely to buy products with these types of claims, which is consistent with previous research that suggests that claims tend to be more utilized by people with higher levels of education,” Smith Taillie said.   As reported in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 13 percent of food and 35 percent of beverage purchases included products with some type of low-content claim. Low-fat purchases were the most common, followed by low-calorie, low-sugar, and low-sodium claims.   On average, packaged foods with low-nutrient claims had 32 percent fewer calories, 11 percent less sugar, and about half the fat and sodium compared to foods that didn’t carry any claims on the packaging.   However, some products with low-nutrient claims actually had more of that substance than foods without those claims.   Also, Smith Taillie said, when a product has a low-sugar claim, for example, it might have less sugar than a reference product or a similar product, “but it doesn’t mean that it has an overall better nutritional quality.”    Or, “it could be a high-sugar food but be low in fat, so it’s going to say low fat on the label. That doesn’t mean that it’s healthy,” she said.   “Essentially, it can be kind of misleading to make a decision about a product based on a front-of-package claim,” she added.   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates what products can claim, Smith Taillie said.   “It’s not that the products are technically wrong in making a low-content claim, it’s just that the rules that allow them to make this kind of claim vary by the claim and by food category,” she said.   Food labels can be confusing, agreed Melissa Rifkin, a dietitian with Montefiore Medical Center in New York City who was not involved in the study.   Understanding what a nutrition fact label means is more important than focusing on marketing claims,” Rifkin told Reuters Health by email.   Key items to focus on are serving size, quantity per container, calories, fat, sodium and sugar, she said.    A new and revamped nutrition fact label is under development, Rifkin said.   “Slowly we will begin to see all labeling take on the new information,” she said.  "
2nbYpIz,2017-03-23,‘Healthy’ obese still face higher heart disease risk," Even without high blood pressure or other signs of illness, obese adults have a much higher risk of developing heart disease than normal-weight peers, according to a study from Denmark.   The results contradict recent research suggesting a subgroup of obese individuals known as “metabolically healthy obese” may not face an increased risk for obesity-related complications such as heart or kidney disease, researchers write in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.   “People have a general understanding now that it is not unhealthy to be overweight or obese as long as your lifestyle is relatively healthy,” said senior study author Kristine Faerch of the Steno Diabetes Center in Copenhagen.   “But overweight and obesity is associated with a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease,” she told Reuters Health by email. “Maintaining a healthy weight through life is important to lower risk.”   Faerch and colleagues analyzed data for more than 6,200 men and women who participated in a large Danish study and were followed for at least 10 years.    They looked at participants’ starting body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height. BMI of less than 24.9 kilograms per square meter was considered normal weight, BMI of 25 to 29.9 was considered overweight and BMI of 30 or above was considered obese. Someone 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighing 210 pounds, for example, would have a BMI of 31.   The researchers also looked at four heart disease risk factors at the beginning of the study and at periodic follow-ups: low HDL (“good”)cholesterol, and elevated blood pressure, triglycerides and blood sugar. Metabolically healthy individuals were defined as having none of these risk factors, and metabolically unhealthy individuals had at least one.    During the follow-up period, 323 participants developed heart disease. Men who started out metabolically healthy and obese had three times the risk compared to metabolically healthy normal-weight men. Metabolically healthy obese women had double the risk of their normal-weight counterparts.    Men who were metabolically healthy and overweight, but not obese, at the outset had the same risk as healthy normal-weight men, and risk was only slightly increased for metabolically healthy overweight women.    Researchers also factored into their calculations any changes in metabolic health status over the course of the study. Just 58 men and 114 women, or 3 percent of the study population, qualified as “metabolically healthy obese” at the start. And 40 percent of these became metabolically unhealthy during a five-year period.    “What this study shows, before even looking at outcomes, is how rare a strictly healthy type of obesity is in the first place,” said Joshua Bell of the University of Bristol in the UK, who wasn’t involved with the Danish study. “(It’s) about 1 in 10 obese adults, and like we’ve found in previous studies, this status is often temporary.”    Bell and colleagues published research in the International Journal of Obesity in February that suggests obesity also hastens age-related functional decline and disability, even in metabolically healthy adults.   “As important as heart disease is, it’s not the only aspect that can go wrong,” he said. “We also need to consider musculoskeletal impairments and other outcomes that affect quality of life,” he told Reuters Health by email.   Bell’s team found that during two decades of aging, physical function declined two times more and body pain increased six times more in so-called healthy obese adults compared to normal-weight adults.    “This will become increasingly important as more people live with obesity for longer as we get better at controlling heart disease,” Bell said.   Future research may also focus on different definitions of metabolically healthy obesity, said Matthias Schulze at the German Institute of Human Nutrition in Potsdam-Rehbruecke who wasn’t involved with either study. Instead of body mass index, measurements could use waist circumference, waist-hip ratio or body fat distribution, he noted.    “We know now that the healthy state can change to the unhealthy state quickly over the course of a few years,” Schulze said by email. “The question now is - what can we do to reduce risk in both groups?”  "
2nhCnGf,2017-03-23,Foam soap may not measure up to liquid soap," Foam soaps are increasingly replacing traditional liquid soaps in hospitals, nursing homes, schools, the food industry and other public spaces, but the trend may carry a risk, a small study suggests.    Foam soaps may not be as effective as liquid soaps in eliminating bacteria that can lead to infection, the authors say.   “In this pilot study, when standard hand washing techniques were used - washing wet hands with one pump of foam soap for six seconds and drying with a paper towel for four seconds – the foam soap was not as effective as the liquid soap in eliminating the hand bacterial load,” Dr. Ozlem Equils at UCLA’s School of Medicine and the Miora Educational Foundation in Encino, California, told Reuters Health by email.   Equils and colleagues tested two common brands of foam and liquid detergent-based soaps that are available in neighborhood grocery stores.    When volunteers washed with foam soap, the average bacterial colony count on each hand went from 3.6 to 2.6, on a scale from 1 to 4 - a difference that could have been a coincidence. With liquid soap, the colony count went from 3.8 to 1.2 - a statistically significant drop, according to a report in the American Journal of Infection Control.    Each group had five healthy test subjects. Two more sets of experiments were conducted with additional volunteers and yielded similar results.    The research team suggests foam soap may be less effective than liquid soap because it comes out of the pump as a lather, whereas the liquid soap lather is built up in the process of hand washing. Also, the amount of soap in foam is markedly less in a single pump than is found in its liquid counterpart.    Dr. Guenter Kampf, a hand hygiene expert at the University of Ernst in Germany, told Reuters Health that because the study was small and the methods weren’t rigorous, more robust research is needed to confirm the findings.   In the meantime, he said, “For domestic use it may not make a difference whether a foam or liquid soap is used because cleaning of the hands is the main purpose of washing them.”    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration “has recently banned the marketing of over-the-counter consumer antiseptic wash products containing antibacterial chemicals due to the concern over emerging antimicrobial resistance,” Equils noted.   The FDA has said it’s not clear that anti-bacterial soaps available to consumers are any more effective at preventing sickness than regular soap and water. The two brands of soaps in this study did not claim to be antimicrobial.   As for alternatives to potentially ineffective foam soaps, Kampf said, “The most effective formulations are alcohol-based hand rubs or gels. That is why they are used in health care.”    The second most effective type of product will be antimicrobial soaps closely followed by plain soaps, he said. “But it should always be kept in mind that the efficacy depends on the antimicrobial substance, its concentration, the volume of the product used and the application time. That is why a general assessment has limitations.”   The genesis of the study was the collaboration between Nicolette Dixon, an undergraduate biochemistry major at Washington State University in Pullman and lead author on the paper, and The Miora Educational Foundation, which connects high school students with mentors in healthcare and STEM fields.

2mSr1GB,2017-03-22,Pregabalin found ineffective against sciatic pain," (Reuters Health) - - Pregabalin, the pain-fighting drug better known by the Pfizer brand name Lyrica, works no better than placebo at relieving the leg pain associated with sciatica, according to results from an Australian study of more than 200 patients.   Volunteers tested after eight weeks of therapy and again at the 52-week mark were just as likely to report improvement whether they received Lyrica or a dummy drug.   The average pain intensity on a zero to 10 scale, where higher numbers mean more pain, was 3.7 with pregabalin and 3.1 with placebo after eight weeks of therapy. The participants started out with pain levels of 6.3 and 6.1, respectively.   After one year, the average leg-pain intensity score was 3.4 with pregabalin and 3.0 with placebo, according to results in the New England Journal of Medicine.   However, pregabalin generated more side effects, with 227 adverse events in that group compared with 124 with placebo. Dizziness was the biggest problem.   “The lack of benefit and increased risk of harm provides a strong case to not use this medicine in patients for sciatica,” chief author Dr. Christine Lin of the University of Sydney told Reuters Health in an email.   Pfizer was hoping that if sciatica proved responsive to Lyrica, “this would be a real boon to increase its use,” said Dr. Bruce Senter, an assistant professor of orthopedics at Tulane University in New Orleans, who was not involved in the study. “Unfortunately, this study doesn’t bear out the usefulness for this.”   Although tests of Lyrica from 2003 to 2010 showed that it works for other types of pain, controlled trials conducted during the past five years have tended to show either negative results or minimal effects, write Drs. Nadine Attal of the University of Versailles-Saint Quentin and Michel Barrot of the University of Strasbourg in an accompanying editorial.   There is no definitive therapy for the radiating leg pain of sciatica, which can also spark back pain, reflex problems, weakness and sensory loss. The condition typically goes away in three quarters of patients within three months.   Originally developed as a therapy for epilepsy, most prescriptions for the $5 billion-a-year drug are now for pain relief.   Based on Australian data, perhaps 14 percent of pregabalin prescriptions were for sciatica, Lin estimated.   In the last year or two, Senter told Reuters Health by phone, “more people have been put on it as an as-needed analgesic. This study seems to support that that’s not a good use for it. It doesn’t seem to work that way.”   In the study, volunteers from 47 sites in New South Wales were treated for moderate-to-severe sciatica. Patients who reported severe depression or suicidal thoughts were excluded. Since 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has required all epilepsy drugs to carry a warning about the risk of suicidal behavior.   All volunteers were advised to remain active and were told their symptoms would probably diminish over time.    In addition to no difference in pain relief, pregabalin produced no significant improvement in disability, back pain intensity, the amount of time absent from work, the likelihood that a patient would use other pain medications or the quality of life on either a physical or mental scale.   “One reason we think that pregabalin does not work for sciatica is that it has different underlying pain mechanisms than other types of nerve pain,” Lin said. “Pain mechanisms can be very complex and influenced by a range of pathological and psycho-social factors.”   Dizziness was three times more common with pregabalin, seen in four out of 10 patients on the drug. Back pain was nearly twice as common in these patients. None of the drug-related adverse events were considered serious, though.   The researchers saw no increase in suicidal thinking, but the study wasn’t designed to detect that as a risk, they caution in the report. “It is important that doctors continue to be cautious with regard to prescribing pregabalin to patients who are susceptible to self-harm,” the study team writes.  "
2mU6u3T,2017-03-22,Many U.S. women start pregnancy with poor diets," (Reuters Health) - Most women have poor diets around the time of conception that may increase the risk of pregnancy complications like excessive weight gain, high blood pressure, impaired fetal growth and preterm deliveries, a U.S. study suggests.    During the three months around conception, the study found that women got roughly one-third of their energy from so-called empty calories like alcohol and foods loaded with sugars and fats. Their top sources of energy were soda, pasta, cookies, cake, bread, beer, wine and spirits.    “In particular, the fact that soda was the primary source of calories was concerning,” said lead study author Lisa Bodnar, a public health researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.   “Soda provides essentially no nutrition,” Bodnar said by email. “But it is something that can be replaced with water or other non-caloric beverages to eliminate those extra calories that may be contributing to obesity.”   For the study, researchers examined data from dietary questionnaires completed by 7,511 women when they were 6 to 14 weeks pregnant. Participants were asked to recall what they ate during the three months around conception, then researchers scored women’s diets with up to 100 points for following every aspect of healthy diet guidelines.   Overall, the average score was just 63 points, researchers report in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.   However, more white women got close to achieving an ideal diet than the Hispanic or black women in the study. About one quarter of white women scored in the top-fifth, with scores typically around 79, while only 14 percent of Hispanic women and 4.6 percent of black women were in this healthiest-diet category.    Among all the women, higher education levels tended to go along with higher-quality diets.   It’s possible the racial and ethnic differences in diet quality may help explain differences in pregnancy and birth outcomes for women of color, who have higher rates of complications like preterm birth and poor fetal growth than white women, Bodnar said.    One limitation of the study is that it relied on women to accurately recall and report on what they ate right before pregnancy, the authors note. The study also isn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that eating or avoiding certain things might influence the risk of specific pregnancy complications.    It’s also possible that the women were reporting eating habits during rather than before pregnancy or describing healthier diets than they really had because they were already pregnant when they completed the surveys, said Dr. Emily Oken, a public health and nutrition researcher at Harvard University in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.    Women planning a pregnancy should ensure they are consuming a healthy diet at least three months before they conceive and try to maintain this diet throughout pregnancy. This includes avoiding soda and sugary drinks as well as eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy, Bodnar said.   One place women can go for guidance is the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s MyPlate Daily Checklist, she added ( bit.ly/2b9ygoS ).    Nutrition is important, but it is just one aspect of health women should try to focus on before getting pregnant, Oken said by email.    “It is critically important that women enter pregnancy with healthy levels of characteristics that are related to diet and nutrition - adequate nutrient intake, healthy weight, normal blood pressure, and normal blood sugar,” Oken said. “These factors are important for long-term maternal health, as well as child health, and the very early pregnancy period is especially critical.”  "
2n6Uj60,2017-03-20,Health and behavior problems can linger after child abuse," (Reuters Health) - - Children who have suffered from abuse or neglect may have physical or behavioral health problems even after the mistreatment stops, new guidelines for pediatricians emphasize.    The guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics build on previous advice for doctors to be on the lookout for signs of past maltreatment. Since the last guidelines came out in 2008, new evidence has documented the connection between mistreatment early in childhood and subsequent health problems, and studies have provided fresh insight into the lasting effects of chronic stress.   “Child maltreatment is seriously under-reported,” said lead author of the guidelines, Dr. Robert Sege of Tufts University and Health Resources in Action in Boston.   “As a result, pediatricians who are treating a child for complex behavioral problems, especially when these problems seem difficult to treat, might do well to consider that the symptoms may have arisen due to prior abuse or neglect,” Sege said by email.    Although some children recover from adversity, traumatic experiences can result in significant disruption of normal development, researchers note in Pediatrics.    Children, like adults, can develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that may be accompanied by depression, anxiety or disruptive or defiant behaviors, for example.    Child abuse early in life is also a risk factor for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).    When children have experienced neglect or abuse, they may respond to certain sights, sounds, smells or actions in ways that appear overly dramatic or inappropriately emotional, the guidelines note.    This may happen because when children are exposed to reminders of past maltreatment, their brain experiences a fight-or-flight response similar to what occurred during the initial abuse or trauma.   Kids may also have behavioral responses to teachers or caregivers that are shaped by past mistreatment. For example, stern warnings can become louder and brusquer and discipline can seem harsher.    Early brain development can also be impacted by what’s known as toxic stress, or chronic exposure to severe stress over a long period of time. This can also alter kids’ hormonal development and influence how soon they enter puberty.    Pediatricians can ask about exposure to stress, abuse or neglect as part of taking down a child’s medical history, the guidelines note. Doctors can also help parents and caregivers understand that children with a history of maltreatment may not feel psychologically safe and may need different types of support or discipline than other kids.    “The good news is that once in the safe care of non-maltreating adults, there are a set of parenting skills that can be learned that are very helpful in responding to child behavior that may be the result of traumatic response,” said Melissa Jonson-Reid, a researcher at Washington University in St. Louis who wasn’t involved in the guidelines.   “The other important take-home message is that children are not responding in ways meant to disrupt the family,” Jonson-Reid said by email. “Parents can help their own stress level by realizing that these are just adaptations to past events not a reflection of the current feelings or negative thoughts the child may have of them as parents.”   Parents and pediatricians should be alert to potential signs of abuse or mistreatment such as a lack of interest in usual activities, sleep disturbance or changes in appetite, said Dr. Charles Nemeroff, a researcher at the University of Miami in Florida who wasn’t involved in the guidelines.    “Isolation, drop in grades, and reluctance to take part in certain activities are all warning signs of possible abuse,” Nemeroff said by email.    “Parents need to be vigilant about the safety of their children and educate their children about appropriate and inappropriate behavior,” Nemeroff added. “Perpetrators often seek positions with access to children including coaching, gardening, repairmen, clergy, and often perpetrators are family members.”  "
2nKinKe,2017-03-21,Canadian youth hockey injuries cut in half after national policy change," (Reuters Health) - Injuries fell by half and concussions were reduced by almost two thirds after Hockey Canada banned body checking for players younger than 13 years old, researchers say.   “Concussions are among the most commonly-occurring injuries in youth recreation, and although many recover quickly, some experience ongoing symptoms,” said study author Kathryn Schneider of the University of Calgary Sport Injury Prevention Research Center in Alberta.    “The goal is to reduce the public health impact of this by preventing injuries from the start,” she told Reuters Health.   About half a million youth in the U.S. and Canada are registered in ice hockey leagues each year, the researchers write in British Journal of Sports Medicine. Past research has identified body-checking – slamming into an opponent in an effort to separate them from the puck – as a major source of injuries, they add.   In 2013, Hockey Canada disallowed body checking in Pee Wee leagues made up of 11- and 12-year-olds, postponing its introduction to the Bantam league, made up of 13- and 14-year olds. To see how the new policy affected injuries, the research team looked at records for the 2011-2012 season, before the change, and for the 2013-2014 season that followed the change.   They studied 883 players from 59 teams for 2011-2012 and 618 players from 73 teams for 2013-2014. In the first time period, there were 163 injuries during games, or 4.37 injuries per 1,000 game-hours, and 104 concussions, or 2.79 per 1,000 game-hours.   In the second time period, there were 48 injuries, or 2.16 per 1,000 game-hours, and 25 concussions, or 1.12 per 1,000 game-hours. Before the policy change, body checking was the most common cause of injury, whereas afterward it was “accidental contact.”   The results translate to a drop of 770 injuries and 580 concussions in Alberta annually, the authors note, as well as 6,300 fewer injuries and 4,800 fewer concussions across Canada annually.   “Anytime there’s a new policy change, it’s important to study the effect of that change and ensure there are no unintended negative consequences,” said Dr. M. Alison Brooks of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, who wasn’t involved with the study.   “This research group has a historic longitudinal perspective with these ice hockey players and is a well-known, experienced team,” Brooks told Reuters Health. “They do groundbreaking work in this area, and I always have great confidence that it’s high quality data.”   As Schneider and colleagues continue youth ice hockey research with Hockey Canada, they’re investigating other injury-related factors, such as concussion prevention, concussion testing, equipment, helmet fit and rehabilitation. They’re also investigating the economic impact of the policy change.   In addition, Hockey Canada has discussed moving the body checking age even higher to 15, 16 or 17. The Canadian Pediatric Society has recommended delaying body checking until age 15.   Supporters argue that the change would keep kids safer longer, especially if they participate recreationally and don’t plan to play ice hockey at collegiate or professional levels. Critics say kids need to learn body checking as a fundamental skill, which can prevent injuries if learned early.   “With this policy change in Canada, I expect to see the sport grow exponentially as more people are willing and interested in having their kids play in a lower-risk environment,” Brooks said.   USA Hockey delayed the introduction of body checking until ages 13 and 14 in 2012. USA Hockey’s American Development Model introduces basic body contact around age 8 and recommends that players feel confident and trained by ages 11 and 12 in how to use their body to protect or take the puck.    Younger players don’t develop basic ice hockey skills as well if they’re worried about blocking against body checking and becoming injured, Brooks said. Once body checking worries are removed, they’re better able to focus on passing, skating and shooting.   “If your kid would like to play, consider having them join a non-checking league, which is common in most adult leagues,” she said. “If there aren’t many available in your area, start the discussion about creating one for kids.”  "
2lMrHQD,2017-03-20,"When CVS stopped selling cigarettes, some customers quit smoking"," (Reuters Health) - - The retail pharmacy company CVS Health helped its customers quit smoking by pulling cigarettes off the shelves two years ago, a new study suggests.   Smokers who purchased cigarettes exclusively at CVS stores were 38 percent less likely to buy tobacco after the national chain stopped selling cigarettes, the study shows.    In addition, cigarette sales dropped 1 percent - or by 95 million packs - in 13 states in the eight months after CVS left the tobacco market in September 2014, according to the report in the American Journal of Public Health.   “It shows that responsible behavior by a pharmacy has public health benefits for the whole population,” Stanton Glantz said in a phone interview. He directs the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco, and was not involved with the study.   The results provide “very strong evidence” that removing tobacco from CVS’ more than 7,800 stores reduced smoking, Glantz said. “It was a big enough effect that you could see it in the population level, which is very impressive,” he said.   The findings heartened Dr. Troyen Brennan, CVS Health’s chief medical officer and one of the study’s authors.   “We think that this research definitely shows that if pharmacies didn’t sell cigarettes, fewer people would smoke, more people would live longer, and fewer people would die,” he said in a phone interview.   Brennan and a team of CVS researchers analyzed data from a nationally representative survey of consumers’ cigarette purchases at drug, food, big box, dollar, convenience and gas station retailers prior to and one year following the company’s exit from the cigarette market.   While they found that shoppers who purchased cigarettes exclusively from CVS were 38 percent more likely to stop buying cigarettes altogether, they could not conclude that those customers kicked the habit. The data shows they did not purchase cigarettes elsewhere, but it remained unclear whether they got cigarettes from another source, possibly a friend or relative, Brennan said.   But states in which CVS pulled out of the tobacco market sold 0.14 fewer packs of cigarettes per smoker a month compared to other states, the study found.   In 1970, the American Pharmaceutical Association declared cigarette displays to be in conflict with the public health role of pharmacies. The following year, the association recommended that pharmacies stop selling tobacco.    But until CVS quit the business, nationwide pharmacy chains had ignored the recommendation.   “We know that tobacco kills 488,000 people a year in the U.S.,” Brennan said. “How can you sell that kind of thing when you’re supposed to be emphasizing health care?”   Public health advocates have pressed Walgreens to also clear its shelves of cigarettes. But the pharmacy chain, one of the nation’s largest, has refused to leave the tobacco market.   Asked to comment about the study, Walgreens provided a written statement. “We believe that the most effective step we can take to help smokers quit is to address the root causes of smoking, which go far beyond the small percentage of smokers who access this product at pharmacies,” it says.   “We have made an active decision to reduce space and visibility of tobacco products in certain of our stores as we focus on helping customers who want to stop smoking,” the statement says.   Robin Koval, CEO and president of Truth Initiative, a Washington, D.C. nonprofit dedicated to ending youth smoking, took Walgreens to task for failing to follow CVS’ lead and “missing a significant opportunity to serve their customers’ health and welfare.”   The new study underscores the need for Walgreens to remove tobacco from its stores, Koval, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.   Smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S. One in four American adults use tobacco, and nearly 17 percent smoke cigarettes.    The vast majority of smokers want to quit, Brennan said. Consequently, moving cigarettes out of their line of sight helps them to abstain.   “Cigarettes are an impulsive buy,” he said. “When you change availability, you can change the smoking habits of individuals.”  "
2mY9IFX,2017-03-17,Sleep apnea in children tied to changes in brain," (Reuters Health) - In children with a common condition that causes them to periodically stop breathing during sleep, areas of the brain involved with thinking and problem-solving appear to be smaller than in children who sleep normally, a study finds.   Researchers can’t say the brain changes actually cause problems for children at home or school, but they do say the condition, known as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), has been tied to behavior and cognitive problems.   “It really does seem that there is a change in the brain or that the brain is affected,” said study author Paul Macey, who is director of technology and innovation at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Nursing.   Macey and colleagues write in Scientific Reports that up to 5 percent of all children are affected by OSA. The condition causes the child’s airway to become blocked, which ultimately causes the brain to go without oxygen for short periods of time and may wake the child up.   Previous studies on lab animals and adults with OSA have shown changes in the brain due to nerve cells dying, they add.    For the new study, the researchers used magnetic resonance imaging to analyze the volume of children’s gray matter, which is the outermost layer of the brain that allows for higher levels of functioning like problem solving.   They compared brain scans from 16 children with OSA and 200 children without the condition. All the youngsters were between 7 and 11 years old.   Overall, children with OSA had decreases in gray matter volume in areas of the brain important for controlling cognition and mood, compared to the other children.   Macey, who is also affiliated with the UCLA Brain Research Institute, said it’s unclear how closely changes in the brain are connected to behavior, cognition and other issues.   “We know these two things are happening, but we’re not sure how much the reduced gray matter tracks with poor scores,” he told Reuters Health.   The researchers also can’t say exactly why OSA is tied to reduce gray matter volume among children. A lack of oxygen may kill off brain cells or it may stop the brain from properly developing, for example.   Macey’s team wants to see whether treating the condition helps children get back on track with their healthy peers.   “If we did that we would know better how people recover from it or not,” he said.   Dr. Eliot Katz, of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital, said previous research shows treating OSA by removing tonsils and adenoids improves children’s school performance, behavior and sleep-related issues. Evidence is mixed on whether it improves cognition.   Katz, who wasn’t involved with the new study, said the previous research on problems faced by children with OSA - like behavior and cognition - is fitting nicely with the brain imaging studies.   “This is really the first large, really well controlled study that has found decrements in gray matter in children with obstructive sleep apnea,” he told Reuters Health.   He said parents should discuss symptoms of OSA with children’s healthcare providers. Those symptoms include chronic snoring and gaps in breathing while they sleep.   “Sleep complaints are often not addressed in well child care visits,” he said, or in training programs for pediatricians.   He advises parents to “take a brief phone video of the breathing pattern that’s concerning to them and show it to their pediatrician.”   Macey said daytime tiredness and mood issues can also be symptoms of OSA. Children who are overweight and obese are at higher risk for the condition.  "
2mRBphO,2017-03-17,Scant consumer information in local TV coverage of Obamacare," (Reuters Health) - Local TV news coverage of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), often called Obamacare, generally focused more on politics than on information consumers can use to help choose insurance, a recent study suggests.    Overall, less than half of ACA-related news coverage focused on health insurance products, while much of the rest of the spots concentrated on political disagreements over the law, researchers report in the American Journal of Public Health.    Just seven percent of stories covered policy changes designed to help make coverage more affordable for many consumers - including expanded eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies to cover some of the cost of insurance premiums.    “We were surprised by the overall low frequency with which local TV news covered key components of the ACA - the Medicaid expansion and the subsidies provided to help people earning less than 400 percent of the federal poverty level afford their premiums and cost-sharing,” said lead study author Sarah Gollust of the University of Minnesota School of Public Health in Minneapolis.   “These are the most important policy tools that the law used to expand insurance coverage to lower-income Americans, but were not a focus of news coverage,” Gollust said by email. “When examining policy implementation details, the news tended to cover website glitches and enrollment numbers more than the actual details in the law that could help people.”   For the study, researchers examined 1,569 local news stories about Obamacare that aired in 2013 and 2014.    About one third of the stories focused on glitches with the government websites set up to help consumers enroll in health plans, the study found.    Another 27 percent of the stories concentrated on the number of people signing up for coverage.    People affiliated with the federal or state government or political parties were the most common sources for interviews, and the news stories only rarely cited research on ACA.    For millions of Americans who get most of their news from local television, the balance of stories about Obamacare and the information provided during newscasts could be the main way consumers determined if the law was a failure or a success, the researchers note.    One limitation of the study is that it’s not based on a representative sample of all local news coverage nationwide about the ACA, the authors point out. It also didn’t examine other sources of news, whether national broadcast networks, newspapers, radio, websites or social media.    Still, there’s an undeniable link between people’s exposure to news media and decisions they make about their health care, including whether they selected public health coverage made available through Obamacare, said Brendan Saloner, a health policy and management researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.    “If people are feeling discouraged, confused, or overwhelmed, this can reduce their likelihood of seeking health insurance, which may keep them uninsured and undermine their access to valuable medical services,” Saloner, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “In fact, a large portion of people who are uninsured are eligible for subsidies or Medicaid, but many of these people do not realize that they could benefit from these programs,” Saloner added. “The news media can fill this informational void.”  "
2nAc6kv,2017-03-17,How touch can shape babies’ brain development," (Reuters Health) - For newborns, skin-to-skin contact with parents and caregivers may help shape how their brains respond to touch, a sense necessary for social and emotional connections, a new study suggests.    Plenty of previous research has linked skin-to-skin touch with developmental benefits for both premature and full-term babies, ranging from improved growth and sleep to better motor development.    Research has also tied breastfeeding and other forms of supportive touch to less discomfort during from needle sticks and other painful medical procedures.    In the current study, researchers tested how 125 premature and full-term infants responded to gentle touch. Overall, the preemies were more likely than the full-term babies to have a reduced response to this contact, the study found.    But preemies who had more gentle contact with parents and caregivers had a stronger response to touch than the preterm infants who didn’t get this type of support. The preterm babies who had more exposure to painful medical procedures also had a reduced response to touch.   “Our findings add to our understanding that more exposure to these types of supportive touch can actually impact how the brain processes touch, a sense necessary for learning and social-emotional connections,” said lead study author Dr. Nathalie Maitre of Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.    “What is surprising is that painful procedures which are known to impact processing of pain in the brain also impact processing of touch, in a negative way,” Maitre said by email.     Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born after 37 weeks are considered full term. In the weeks immediately after birth, premature babies often have difficulty breathing and digesting food. They can also encounter longer-term challenges such as impaired vision, hearing, and cognitive skills as well as social and behavioral problems.   The preemies in the study were born between 24 and 36 weeks gestation, while the full-term infants arrived between 38 and 42 weeks. They all participated in the touch experiment before they were discharged from the hospital where they were born.    Newborn development, especially in the first few months, is heavily shaped by touch and sound, as the visual system is still very immature, Maitre said. Touch is a way for infants to learn about their surroundings and an early way to communicate with their parents.     To evaluate how newborns respond to touch, researchers exposed all of the infants in the study to a light puff of air and a “fake” puff of air and measured their brain responses.    Researchers chose a puff of air because it does not generate enough pressure to activate any pain receptors, Maitre said. If the infant brain can respond to this touch, babies can also learn how to tell the difference between different textures, for example the difference between their mother’s skin and a hard object, or even their father’s stubbly cheek and their sister’s soft one.   Preemies who were in the neonatal intensive care unit and spent more time in gentle contact with parents and caregivers had a stronger response to touch in the experiment than the preterm infants who didn’t get this gentle contact, researchers report in Current Biology.   However, the more painful medical procedures those premature infants had to endure, the less their brain responded to gentle touch later. That was true despite the fact that the babies were given pain medications and sugar to make those procedures easier to endure.   One limitation of the study is that researchers couldn’t control for opiate use, because all infants undergoing painful procedures received some type of analgesia, the authors note. Researchers also lacked data on the intensity of pain infants might have experienced during different treatments or tests.    Still, promoting gentle touch for all newborns - and especially preemies - may help develop building blocks needed for cognition, behavior and communication, the authors conclude.   "
2m5miEq,2017-03-17,"Dogs, grandkids can keep COPD sufferers active"," (Reuters Health) – - Walking a dog and spending time with grandchildren keep people with impaired lung function more active than their peers who don’t have these outlets, researchers say.                    Grandmothers chat as they take care of their grandchildren on a street in Xiangfan, Hubei province July 11, 2008. REUTERS/Stringer      Staying physically active is important for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and finding things that motivate patients to move “is central to tailoring physical activity recommendations” and planning interventions, the authors write in Thorax.   Patients with COPD who regularly engage in physical activity, even of mild to moderate intensity, have a better prognosis, said senior study author Dr. Judith Garcia-Aymerich of the Barcelona Institute of Global Health in Spain.    The effect of physical activity is “very consistent . . . regardless of subjects’ characteristics, geography, and methods to measure activity,” she said by email.   COPD are lung diseases that make breathing difficult and can cause wheezing or coughing. The most common forms are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. They most often occur in smokers and former smokers. About 30 million Americans currently have COPD, according to the COPD Foundation.   Garcia-Aymerich and her colleagues analyzed data on 410 COPD patients living in Barcelona and four other seaside cities in the Spanish province of Catalonia. Participants answered questions about their daily activities, marital and working status, health conditions and how their health affects their quality of life.   Researchers also used participants’ addresses to determine if they lived within a 15-minute walk of green spaces like parks, or blue spaces like the ocean, lakes or rivers.   For one week, participants wore activity trackers that allowed researchers to tally their physical activity and its intensity.   About 85 percent of the participants were men, 69 years old on average. Nine percent had mild COPD, 53 percent had moderate disease, 31 percent had severe COPD and 7 percent had very severe COPD.    About 12 percent of participants reported walking their dog and about 38 percent said they cared for their grandchildren. Half of them lived near green or blue spaces.   The week of activity tracking showed that participants spent an average of three hours each day being active, about half of that moderately intense.   Participants who walked their dogs were active about 18 minutes more each day than those who didn’t walk a dog. And people who took care of their grandkids were active an average of 9 minutes more each day than those who didn’t.   Nearness to green or blue space did not seem to influence activity levels.    “Walking the dog and playing with grandchildren relates to better health, specifically higher levels of physical activity, even in subjects with moderate-severe respiratory disease,” Garcia-Aymerich said.   “One challenge about observational studies such as this is that we don’t know if people with COPD who chose to have (and walk) dogs or be involved in grandparenting are different in difficult-to-measure ways from those that don’t do these things,” said Dr. William Ehlenbach, a pulmonologist with the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison who wasn’t involved in the study.   Patients with COPD who are not physically active are much more likely to develop progressive activity limitation than those with similar severity of disease who are active, he added.     “Muscle weakness can become a significant problem in patients with COPD and contributes to disability in these patients. With COPD, the adage ‘move it or lose it’ really seems to be true,” Ehlenbach told Reuters Health by email.   He found it interesting that proximity to green space was not associated with increased physical activity and added that it’s hard to translate these findings into specific recommendations since some people don’t have grandkids or like dogs.     “In general, I try to encourage my patients not to let fear or anxiety associated with shortness of breath prevent them from being active. I also encourage going for walks outdoors (weather permitting) or walk in a store or shopping center; even short walks at a slow pace are beneficial,” he said.  "
2m6xiRW,2017-03-16,"Poor, minority neighborhoods have more tobacco-selling shops per capita"," (Reuters Health) - Neighborhoods with a high proportion of black residents or high poverty tend to have the greatest density of stores selling cigarettes and tobacco products, U.S. researchers say.   Poverty explained some of the association, but an urban planning concept, neighborhood “stability” - including the proportion of homes that are rented versus owned - accounted for most of the link, the study team reports in Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.   “The neighborhood you live in shouldn’t determine how much cancer-causing product is present in your day-to-day life,” said lead study author Joseph Lee of East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina.   “The tobacco industry spends a large portion of its advertising budget at retailers, so when we see differences by neighborhood, that’s a big investment by the tobacco industry,” he told Reuters Health.    There are about 375,000 stores in the U.S. that sell tobacco products, Lee’s team writes. In 2014, U.S. stores contained an average of 30 tobacco ads, they add. Cigarette smoking causes about 480,000 deaths each year in the U.S., which is about one of every five deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   Previous studies looking at the density of tobacco stores have mostly focused on small geographic areas, so it’s difficult to tell if the patterns are widespread the authors write.    They calculated the density of 90,400 tobacco outlets in 97 counties across the nation to get a broader picture. These 97 counties contain 79 million people, or about a quarter of the population, the authors note.    Across all counties, the average density of tobacco shops was 1.3 per 1,000 people. But as neighborhood income fell, density of tobacco shops rose. It also rose as the proportion of the neighborhood’s residents who were African American increased.    In addition, a high proportion of vacant housing units or a high proportion of rental units were tied to sharp rises in the density of stores selling tobacco.    Neighborhoods with a high proportion of Hispanic, white or Asian/Pacific Islander residents did not display changes in tobacco store density relative to race or ethnicity.   “Environmental factors, including the location and density of tobacco retailers, have an influence on behaviors,” said Joanna Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Tobacco Control at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “The more accessible a product is, the more likely consumers are to purchase it,” she told Reuters Health by email. “This further contributes to the high toll of tobacco on racial and socioeconomic health disparities.”    Plus, Lee said, in neighborhoods with more tobacco outlets, stores are more likely to run price discounts and promotions, which boosts the advertising exposure and often prompts smokers who are thinking about quitting to buy another pack.    “Each time kids go to the store for a snack, to pay for gas, or to pick up bread and milk, they’re getting a dose of advertising,” Lee added. “Any gas station has a wall of tobacco products behind the register, and that makes them present, visible and normalized.”   One limitation of the study is that it doesn’t differentiate between types and sizes of stores, such as gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacy chains, alcohol stores, convenience stores, newsstands and the discount department store Walmart, which could affect density, the authors write.    In recent years, policy changes have aimed to prevent the sale of menthol and flavored cigarettes near schools in Chicago, San Francisco and Baltimore. Other policies have suggested removing cigarettes from pharmacies and selling little cigars and cigarillos in bundles rather than singles to increase cost, said Phillip Gardiner of the University of California in Oakland, who wasn’t involved in the current study.    “Smokers - especially young kids - are price sensitive,” he said. “We know that as price goes up, consumption goes down.”   “When used as advertised, smoking kills,” Gardiner said. “The tobacco industry is promoting it, and that’s not right.”  "
2mLVjwn,2017-03-16,Lack of sleep linked to behavioral problems in kids," (Reuters Health) - Getting too little sleep in early childhood is linked to cognitive and behavioral problems years later, a U.S. study suggests.   Parents and teachers reported more problems in 7-year-olds who didn’t get enough sleep during their toddler and preschool years, compared to peers who got an age-appropriate amount of sleep during those early years.   “Children who aren’t getting the recommended amount of sleep have more difficulties with attention, with emotional control, with reasoning, with problem-solving, and also have behavioral problems,” lead author Dr. Elsie Taveras told Reuters Health.    “What we found was that insufficient sleep in children was associated with poorer executive function and behavior,” said Taveras, who is chief of general pediatrics at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children in Boston.   Executive function is basically the brain’s ability to process incoming information and respond to that information, Taveras said. “It’s almost like your brain’s functioning (as) air traffic control. Air traffic control has to know how to take in a bunch of information and how to process it.”   Taveras and her colleagues analyzed data on 1,046 children from a study that followed them from before birth. As part of the study, researchers had asked mothers how long the kids slept at age 6 months, 3 years and 7 years. The mothers also filled out health questionnaires every year.    Insufficient sleep was defined as less than 12 hours during infancy, less than 11 hours for 3- and 4-year-olds and less than 10 hours for 5- to 7-year-old kids.    Mothers and teachers were asked to evaluate each child’s executive function and behavior using questionnaires when the kids were 7 years old.    Children who slept less than 10 hours per day at ages 3 to 4 years had lower scores from both mothers and teachers compared to kids who usually slept longer. The results were similar for 5- to 7-year-olds who got less than 9 hours of sleep each night.   Sleep duration between 6 months and 2 years old was not linked to scores at age 7, according to the report in Academic Pediatrics.    Taveras said that being consistent with schedules and routines and setting age-appropriate bedtimes are important for good sleep.   “Don’t have your child go to sleep at midnight on the weekends and then expect that you’re going to be able to get them to bed and asleep by 8:30 on weekdays,” she said.     Taveras also tells parents to get all the screens out of the kids’ bedrooms including small devices that have push notifications or are beeping all night.     “(The study) adds to a building literature that is suggesting at least that having sleep problems early in life are predictive of behavioral and, in other populations, cognitive problems later,” Dr. Dean Beebe told Reuters Health.   “And it is overall consistent with what we’ve seen in other studies in different age ranges,” said Beebe, a pediatric neuropsychologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Having a parent do the sleep rating and then having both the parent and also a teacher do the behavior ratings actually is a really big strength of the study,” he added.   Beebe said he has three pieces of advice for parents. First, is to take a look and see what is the generally recommended amount of sleep for their kids by checking with the National Sleep Foundation ( bit.ly/1Sy48EA ) or the American Academy of Sleep Medicine ( bit.ly/2mzoQa6 ).    “Number two is to pay attention to your child because some kids need more (sleep) and some kids need less,” he said. The third thing is to establish a daily schedule that is sensitive to the child’s needs, and also includes routines, Beebe said.   “The more chaotic and the less predictable that sleep schedule, the more difficulty the kids tend to have with sleep,” he said.   The bedtime routine should involve a winding down period with relaxing activities such as reading a bedtime story, Beebe added. “It seems old fashioned but it’s very calming, it’s very connecting. It can be very soothing, and it’s very predictable,” he said.  "
2mxR2dx,2017-03-16,Can drones deliver emergency defibrillators?," (Reuters Health) - - A drone network could be deployed to speed defibrillators to bystanders trying to help people in cardiac arrest, getting the devices to the patient faster than emergency services, a recent Canadian study suggests.   Researchers examined historical data on 53,702 cardiac arrests over 26,851 square kilometers (10,367 square miles) of rural and urban regions surrounding Toronto, Ontario, to see how drones might be deployed to get help to cardiac arrest patients more quickly than typical 911 response times.    If drones were spread evenly across the region, researchers calculated that it would require 37 drones spread across 23 bases to get patients started on defibrillator treatment about one minute faster than they would have been if they waited for emergency services.   “Because the drone can fly in a straight line, potentially avoiding obstacles that the ambulance cannot, the drone can arrive to scene more quickly and be carrying a defibrillator that a bystander can use before the paramedics arrive,” said Timothy Chan, director of the Center for Healthcare Engineering at the University of Toronto.    “Paramedics can take over after they arrive, but because survival from cardiac arrest is so time sensitive, even defibrillating the patient a minute before paramedics get there can make a huge difference,” Chan said by email.    By concentrating more drones in urban areas instead, it would require 28 drones on 15 bases to get aid to the patients an average of one minute faster, researchers report in Circulation.    In their simulations, drones in the most urban areas yielded a best time savings of 6 minutes 43 seconds, and in the most rural areas, the best clocked times got the drone to the patient 10 minutes and 34 seconds sooner than historical 911 response times.   In cardiac arrest, the heart stops abruptly, often due to irregular heart rhythms. Cardiac arrest may occur with no warning and is often fatal unless the heart can be restarted quickly.   Automated defibrillators are already common in public places like restaurants and airports. These devices typically have electrodes that attach to the chest with sticky pads and deliver shocks based on what a computer in the defibrillator determines the person needs.     Several companies and researchers have developed prototype drone technology that might be used to deliver defibrillators to the scene of a cardiac arrest, researchers note. Google, for example, has a patent for drone delivery of defibrillators and other medical supplies, and companies have also proposed using drones to deliver everything from pizza to official documents.    In the study, researchers calculated that a regional network of 100 drones on 80 bases would be needed to reduce the time it takes to start defibrillators by three minutes. If they concentrated drones in areas with the most people, they would need 70 drones on 49 bases.    If they could get drones to beat 911 times by 3 minutes, 92 percent of cardiac arrest patients would be treated faster under a drone system than they would be by relying on the typical emergency medical services network, the researchers conclude.    One limitation of the study is that researchers used data only on confirmed cardiac arrest cases, not every suspected cardiac arrest called in to 911 dispatchers, the authors note. This might mean they underestimated the number of drones needed, because they would still need to be deployed on calls that turned out to be false alarms.    Another drawback of the study is it doesn’t calculate costs, which the authors note might be considerable.    An effective drone delivery network would also require a massive public education effort to make sure enough bystanders know how to use the defibrillators, said Dr. Peter Pons, a professor emeritus of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study.   “This concept is in its infancy but there have been some initial efforts in this regard,” Pons said by email.   Drones were used to deliver small aid packages in Haiti after the earthquake, Pons said. They have also been used in a trial situation to fly laboratory test specimens from a remote location to an urban testing lab.     “There is certainly the potential for a drone to deliver a defibrillator when needed,” Pons added.

2neb54a,2017-03-16,Eating fruits and vegetables may help curb lung disease," (Reuters Health) - - For current and former smokers, eating more fruits and vegetables may lower the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a Swedish study suggests.                    The fresh fruit and vegetable section is seen at a Walmart Supercenter in Rogers, Arkansas June 6, 2013.     REUTERS/Rick Wilking      Among more than 40,000 men, the current smokers who averaged five or more servings of fruit and vegetables daily were 40 percent less likely to develop COPD than smokers who ate two servings or less. Each additional serving of fruits and greens was tied to an 8 percent risk reduction.   “All smokers and former smokers should eat as much fruits and vegetables as possible,” said lead author Joanna Kaluza of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.   “Each extra serving of fruit and vegetable decreases significantly risk of COPD development,” Kaluza told Reuters Health by email.   COPD is a category of lung diseases that make breathing difficult and can cause wheezing or coughing. The most common types of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis, and they most often occur in smokers and former smokers.   The antioxidants found in produce might help to protect lungs from smoking damage, the researchers write in the journal Thorax.   The team studied data on 44,335 middle-aged and older Swedish men. None of the men included in the analysis had been diagnosed with COPD at the first assessment.   At the start of the study, the participants completed questionnaires detailing how often they ate different types of foods, including fruits and vegetables, as well as their smoking history. Researchers followed the men from 1998 to 2012 and used a patient registry to determine if they were diagnosed with COPD during the study period.   Almost two thirds of the men were current or former smokers and 1,918 were diagnosed with COPD by 2012.    The research team divided participants into five groups according to how many servings of fruit and vegetables they ate daily. The top fifth ate more than five servings per day, while the bottom fifth ate less than two servings daily.   After separating them again by smoking status, researchers found a significantly lowered risk of COPD tied to high fruit and vegetable consumption among smokers and former smokers, but not among never-smokers.    Ex-smokers with high consumption of greens were 34 percent less likely to develop COPD than ex-smokers with low fruit and vegetable consumption, and each additional serving was tied to a 4 percent drop in COPD risk.   When researchers analyzed the types of produce tied to lower COPD risk, they found an association with apples, pears, leafy greens and peppers but not with berries, citrus, tomatoes or onions.   We rely on antioxidants, such as those found in fruits and vegetables, to defend our lungs against harmful substances in cigarette smoke and air pollution, said Seif Shaheen, a professor of respiratory epidemiology at Queen Mary University in London who coauthored an editorial accompanying the study.   However, Shaheen stressed that diet is not a cure-all for the effects of smoking. “The most important thing you can do to reduce your chances of getting COPD is not to smoke/to stop smoking,” he said by email.    “Eating more fruit and vegetables is likely to be beneficial for your health in many ways, and for smokers who can’t stop smoking this may help to reduce your risk of getting COPD,” added Shaheen, who was not involved in the study.   “High fruit and vegetable consumption not only reduces the risk of chronic lung disease, but also cardiovascular disease, cancers, helps to keep proper body weight and other benefits,” Kaluza noted.   “It is possible for everyone to include more fruits and vegetables in their diet,” she said.

2mtdvrj,2017-03-16,Does illness help young adults take charge of their own health?," (Reuters Health) - Adolescents and young adults coping with chronic illness may be better prepared to take charge of their own care than their healthy peers, a recent study suggests.    Researchers examined a critical juncture in adolescent medicine - the transition from being a pediatric patient and getting a lot of guidance from parents to becoming an adult who makes independent medical decisions.    The study of 494 older adolescent and young adult patients found that having chronic medical conditions was associated with greater readiness for this transition, more self-involvement in completing health-related tasks and less input from parents.    “On the one hand, it is encouraging that our sample of adolescents and young adults with medical conditions were taking initiative to self-manage their medical care given developmental expectations for increased independence during emerging adulthood,” said lead study author Cyd Eaton, a psychology researcher at the University of Georgia in Athens.    “On the other hand, it remains unclear if assuming more autonomy for completing these healthcare tasks translates into actual completion of these tasks, independent of parental oversight,” Eaton said by email.    Teens in the study were about 19 years old on average and 116 of them had chronic medical conditions. The most common diagnosis was asthma, which affected 73 of the youth, followed by hearing or vision problems and neurological disorders.    Less common chronic health problems included diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, heart conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, reproductive health issues, blood disorders, cancer, kidney or urinary problems, and sickle cell disease, researchers report in the Journal of Adolescent Health.    There was no meaningful difference between healthy and chronically ill youth when it came to keeping appointments, talking with providers or managing daily activities, the study found.    When participants had to live with illness, they did tend to be better at tasks like managing medications and tracking health issues. Overall, they were more prepared to transition to handling their own medical care.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how chronic illness prepares teens to transition to being independent adult patients, the authors note. Researchers also relied on participants to report on their own abilities at certain tasks and readiness to handle their own care, which might be biased. Most of the participants were white and female, so their perspectives might not reflect the experiences of all patients.    Even so, the findings highlight a need for parents and doctors to do a better job of preparing healthy teens to become smart health consumers, said Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a pediatrics researcher at Seattle Children’s Hospital and the University of Washington who wasn’t involved in the study.    At every visit, Breuner asks her young patients and their parents what they want to get out of the visit and what they expect to happen.    “If we providers ask this every time the patients will be more ready to work with us to improve their health and stay more engaged in both preventative health care and more meaningful health care utilization,” Breuner said by email. “This study points out we need to work on this.”   Teens may not be able to legally consent to treatment or sign medical documents, but parents can still start gradually giving them more responsibilities, said Dr. David Stukus, an allergy and immunology researcher at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Preparing teenagers for independent living and managing their own health doesn’t happen overnight - this takes years of preparation and practice,” Stukus said by email. “Parents should start this process early.”   Parents should expect teens to be more involved in their own care, including having children schedule their own appointments, prepare a list of questions for doctors, and handling their own check-in and check-out, said Sarah Clark, a children’s health researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study.    “And parents, stay out of the exam room,” Clark said by email. “Allow teens and providers to have a focused and private conversation.”  "
2mPrg6W,2017-03-15,Few nearby fertility centers for many U.S. women," (Reuters Health) - Over one-third of women in the United States have limited or no access to medical centers that treat fertility problems, according to a new study.   After examining data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), researchers found fertility centers are mainly located in heavily populated areas in the U.S.   “About 40 percent of women between age 20 and 50 are living in areas where there are either limited or no options for them,” said Dr. John Harris, of the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Medicine and Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC.   Harris and his colleagues write in Fertility and Sterility that lack of geographic access to assisted reproductive technology (ART) is common and a significant obstacle for patients with infertility.   Using census data and information from the CDC, the researchers evaluated geographic access to ART clinics in the U.S. - where, they say, an estimated 7.5 million women face difficulty in having children.   They identified a total of 510 ART clinics in 144 census areas, which are geographic regions drawn by similarities to nearby urban centers.   Overall, clinics tended to cluster near population centers like Boston, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia. About 60 percent of women ages 20 to 49 lived in areas with multiple ART clinics.   About 29 percent lived in areas with no clinics, however. Another 11 percent of women in that age group lived in areas with only one clinic, which means they didn’t have a choice of providers.   In addition to geographic obstacles, cost is also a significant burden since people often pay for fertility treatments out of pocket, Harris said.   Long distances to ART clinics means more costs for travel, lodging and days off work.   “There is already a significant cost burden,” he said. “Whenever you increase the cost, that only increases the barriers.”   The expenses can add up, because in vitro fertilization may require several repeat visits to ART clinics over a short period, according to Dr. Kara Goldman, a reproductive endocrinologist and assistant professor at NYU Langone Medical Center’s Fertility Center in New York.   “This helps to demonstrate the geographic barriers are significant for patients,” said Goldman, who wasn’t involved in the new study. “This is something we have to address in our field.”   Harris said large medical centers can help by operating satellite ART clinics. Business and employers can also help by allowing people additional time off for fertility treatments.  "
2mJCzfe,2017-03-16,"Weight loss, especially with surgery, tied to lower risk of heart failure"," (Reuters Health) - Obese people who get surgery to lose weight have half the risk of developing heart failure compared to patients who make lifestyle changes to shed excess pounds, a recent study suggests.    “We were surprised by the large difference in heart failure incidence between the two groups,” said lead study author Dr. Johan Sundstrom of Uppsala University in Sweden.    It’s possible gastric bypass patients had a lower risk of heart failure because they lost more weight than the group trying to do so without surgery. Researchers also found that losing 10 kilograms (22 pounds) by any means was tied to a 23 percent drop in heart failure risk.   The study team examined data on 25,805 obese people who had gastric bypass surgery, which reduces the stomach to a pouch roughly the size of a walnut, and 13,701 patients who were put on low-calorie diets. After following half of the patients for at least four years, people who had gastric bypass were 46 percent less likely to develop heart failure.    Surgery patients had an average weight loss of 18.8 kg (41.4 lb) more after one year than obese people who instead relied on diet and exercise, the study found. After two years, surgery was associated with an average weight loss of 22.6 kg (49.8 lb) more than lifestyle changes.    Some previous research has linked obesity to heart failure, and a growing body of evidence suggests that obesity might directly cause the heart condition, Sundstrom said. While the current study isn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove a causal relationship, it adds more evidence in support of this possibility.    “Obesity may increase the risk for heart failure through the smorgasbord of conditions that accompany obesity, such as high blood pressure, high blood lipids, diabetes and (rapid irregular heartbeat),” Sundstrom said by email. “Bariatric surgery has been associated with lower incidence of all of these risk factors,”   “There is also some evidence that obesity per se may cause heart failure, a condition sometimes called obesity cardiomyopathy,” Sundstrom said. “From that perspective, weight loss may preserve cardiac function by reducing the heart’s pump demand and stress.”   For the study, researchers examined data on obese people without a history of heart failure from two national patient registries in Sweden. At the start of the study, patients were typically around 41 years old.    Of nearly 40,000 people in the study, 29 in the diet and lifestyle group and 44 in the surgery group developed heart failure. Because the surgery group was so much bigger, the actual rate of heart failure for those patients translates to 4.1 cases for every 10,000 people per year in the surgery group and 7.6 cases per 10,000 per year in the lifestyle group, according to the report in Circulation.   It’s possible that factors not included in the data influenced how much weight people lost or whether they developed heart failure, the authors note.    Heart failure tends to afflict the old, and the study of younger adults may not have followed patients long enough to fully understand the impact of surgery on the heart, said Dr. Sheldon Litwin of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.   “Most patients undergoing bariatric surgery are relatively young; they are at pretty low risk of developing heart failure even if they are obese,” Litwin, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Even so, the study covers new ground and helps establish a connection between weight loss and a reduced risk of heart failure, said Dr. Mary Norine Walsh, a researcher at St. Vincent Heart Center in Indianapolis, Indiana, and president-elect of the American College of Cardiology.    “The take-home message is that weight loss can decrease your risk of developing heart failure down the road,” Walsh, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.    Obese patients should be encouraged by the results, said Dr. John Wilkins, a researcher at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study.    “These data suggest that substantial reductions in weight are most beneficial, but even a modest amount of weight loss - 20 pounds - in obese patients is associated with benefit,” Wilkins added by email.

2nsyjRo,2017-03-16,Many stroke patients don’t get tests to see if they can swallow," (Reuters Health) - One in five patients who have the most common type of stroke don’t get recommended screenings to see if the episode damaged their ability to swallow, a recent study in Canada suggests.    Under widely endorsed treatment guidelines, stroke patients are supposed to be screened for what’s known as dysphagia, or an inability to swallow, before they receive any food or drink. Stroke patients with dysphagia have a higher risk of pneumonia, dehydration, disability and death than people who don’t have difficulty swallowing, previous research has shown.   For the current study, researchers examined data on 6,677 patients hospitalized with what’s known as ischemic stroke, which results from an obstruction in a blood vessel supplying the brain. None of the patients were getting support like feeding or breathing tubes that would make them ineligible for dysphagia screening.    Within 72 hours of arriving at the hospital, 1,280 patients, or about 19 percent, didn’t get screened, researchers report in Stroke.    “Omission of screening mainly occurs in patients with mild strokes, who are only half as likely as patients with more severe strokes to receive screening,” said lead study author Dr. Raed Joundi, a neurology researcher at the University of Toronto.   “Failing a dysphagia screening test increases the risk of poor outcomes - death, disability, complications - as much as other major prognostic factors like older age and severe stroke, and is true even in people with mild strokes,” Joundi said by email.    Elderly people who were at least 80 years old were 44 percent more likely to get checked for dysphagia than patients under 60.    People admitted to the intensive care unit were 56 percent more likely to receive screening, and patients on a stroke unit had more than double the likelihood compared to those on a regular ward.    Among the 5,144 patients who had a documented dysphagia screening in their medical records, nearly half failed the test.    After a severe stroke, 83 percent of patients failed dysphagia screening, compared with 63 percent of patients who had moderate stroke and 33 percent with mild stroke.    Individuals who failed the screening tended to be older and have more chronic medical issues including dementia prior to the stroke.    When they failed the tests, patients were more than four times as likely to develop pneumonia. They also had more than five times the odds of severe disability and were more than twice as likely to be sent to a nursing home or rehabilitation facility after they left the hospital.    One limitation of the study is that medical records might have failed to document screenings done for some patients or any tests done outside the 72-hour window examined, the authors note.    Still, it’s likely the results would be similar for patients outside of Canada and for people who have less common hemorrhagic stroke, which occurs when a weakened blood vessel ruptures, Joundi said.    And the findings suggest that screening efforts need improvement, said Dr. Daniel Lackland, a neurology researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston who wasn’t involved in the study.    Patients and families should ask about screening, and they should alert doctors immediately to symptoms of dysphagia like difficulty starting to swallow, coughing or gagging while swallowing, drooling, weak voice, lost gag reflex or what’s known as aspiration - food or drink getting into the lungs, Lackland advised.     “Early identification of dysphagia and aspiration risk is critical to avoid adverse health consequences including aspiration and pneumonia - as well as dehydration, malnutrition, weight loss, and ultimately increased risk of death,” Lackland said by email.   “Furthermore, these dysphagia-related adverse health consequences from stroke may lead to reduced patient satisfaction caused by longer length of hospital stay, reduced ability to participate in rehabilitation, and reduced level of independence at discharge,” Lackland added.

2moxNDb,2017-03-15,Americans are having less sex these days," (Reuters Health) - - It you think your sex life isn’t what it once was, you’re not alone. People in the U.S. are having less sex today than they did generations ago, and a new study suggests that marriage may be part of the problem.    Married people typically had sex 73 times a year in 1990, researchers report in the Archives of Sexual Behavior. But by 2014 married couples were having sex just 55 times a year, trailing single people who had sex 59 times a year.   As a rule, unpartnered people used to have less sex, on average, compared to those who were married or living together, researchers note.     “Some of this is due to age - people get married later now,” said lead study author Jean Twenge, a psychology researcher at San Diego State University. “But even when we take age into account, the marriage advantage in sexual frequency is smaller than it once was.”   For unmarried people, sexual frequency increased from 1989 to 2002, perhaps because of loosening norms about premarital sex, Twenge added by email. But then, around 2008, their sexual frequency started to slide - and both married and unmarried people started having sex less often.    “That might be because smartphones premiered in 2007, Netflix streaming video in 2007 and YouTube in 2006,” Twenge said.   “Our entertainment is more entertaining, and more on-demand than it once was,” Twenge added. “There are a lot more things to do at 10 p.m. at home than there used to be.”   To examine shifts in national sex habits, researchers looked at survey data collected from 1972 to 2014 on a nationally representative sample of 56,859 adults.    Among other things, participants answered questions about how often they had sex in the past 12 months, and demographics like their education level and marital status.    As recently as 2002, the average American adult had sex about 64 times a year, but by 2014 that declined to 53 times a year. The decrease in sexual frequency was largest among those with a college degree, people in the South and married or divorced individuals.    One limitation of the study is that the survey didn’t specify what types of sex it was asking about, making it possible that some respondents might have been counting just vaginal-penile intercourse while others might have included oral or anal sex in their tally, the authors note. The survey also didn’t look at masturbation.    Importantly, the study also doesn’t prove that more sex necessarily makes people happier, noted Christian Joyal, a researcher at the University of Quebec at Trois-Rivieres who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It is clear that couples are happier, in general, than singles, especially for middle-agers, for many reasons,” Joyal said by email. “Among them is interpersonal complicity and sexuality - so as long as interpersonal sexuality is concerned, quality, much more than quantity is important.”   One concern, though, is that married couples - especially with kids at home -  are working longer hours and facing more intense financial pressures that may put a damper on their sex lives, said Michael Aaron, a sex therapist in private practice in New York City who wasn’t involved in the study.    “As the gap is widening between rich and poor and the middle class is disappearing, more people have to spend more time working, sometimes even two or three jobs, just to stay afloat,” Aaron said by email. “That doesn’t leave much time or energy for sex.”   Worldwide, fewer people are getting married and having kids, and people are also having less sex, said David Ley, author of The Myth of Sex Addiction.   “The trends in this study aren’t unique to the U.S.,” Ley, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Are they a reason to be concerned? Who knows? Perhaps the world needs fewer humans right now, until we can start exporting colonists to other planets.”  "
2mFpQMj,2017-03-13,Cystic fibrosis patients live longer in Canada than in U.S.," (Reuters Health) - Canadians with cystic fibrosis, a life threatening inherited disorder of the lungs and digestive system, tend to survive about a decade longer than American patients, a new study suggests.    Researchers examined national registry data collected from 1990 to 2013 for 5,941 patients with cystic fibrosis in Canada and another 45,456 patients in the U.S.    Half of the Canadians survived past age 51, whereas half of the U.S. patients had died by age 41.   “There was a significant difference in survival between the two countries even after accounting for differences in patient characteristics related to disease severity,” said lead study author Dr. Anne Stephenson, a researcher at the University of Toronto and the Adult Cystic Fibrosis Center at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto.    Even though researchers didn’t have data to explore all the factors that might contribute to differing survival rates, it’s possible that insurance might explain at least some of the gap.    “We used insurance status as a surrogate marker for the U.S. health care system compared to the universal health care system in Canada,” Stephenson said by email. “We found that U.S. patients with private health insurance had similar survival to Canadians, however, insurance status in the U.S. is a complex construct and may reflect a combination of other unmeasured factors such as socioeconomic status.”   Overall, the risk for death was 34 percent lower in Canada than in the U.S., researchers report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.    Compared to U.S. patients continuously insured by Medicaid or Medicare, which are government health programs for the poor and disabled, Canadians had a 44 percent lower risk of death, the study found.    And, relative to American patients without any insurance, Canadians had a 77 percent lower risk of death.    Diet may also explain part of the survival advantage for Canadians. Cystic fibrosis affects the ability of the digestive system to absorb fat, which leads to malnutrition.    A high-fat diet, associated with better survival for cystic fibrosis patients, has been recommended in Canada since the 1970s but wasn’t implemented in the U.S. until the 1980s.    Differences in selecting patients for lung transplantation - which was also associated with better survival odds - may explain the longer lifespans in Canada as well, the researchers note.    “There are fundamental differences between Canada and the U.S. with respect to health care systems - universal care versus market based - but also with education and other developmental needs,” said Dr. Patrick Flume, a researcher at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston who wrote an accompanying editorial.    “I think that the overall survival differences between Canada and the U.S., and the large survival gap especially in cystic fibrosis patients, is an outcome that demonstrates how the market based approach is less successful,” Flume added by email.    The study was funded by the U.S. Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.  "
2njahbu,2017-03-13,Heart failure patients may benefit from fish oil: advisory," (Reuters Health) - A new American Heart Association report says people with heart failure may live longer by taking omega-3 fish oil supplements because they seem to reduce the heart disease death rate by almost 10 percent.   The association had previously concluded that such supplements may prevent death from heart disease in people who have already had a heart attack, but warned there is no solid evidence that fish oil can prevent heart disease in the first place, primarily because the issue hasn’t been studied.   “Reducing mortality by 10 percent would be important from a personal level and a population level,” coauthor Dr. David Siscovick said about the new advice for people with heart failure.   The scientific advisory published in the association’s journal Circulation updates a 2002 guidance with data from 15 newer studies. It comes at a time when about 19 million Americans - nearly 8 percent of the U.S. population - are already taking the supplements, many of whom may not be getting any real value from them.   “This is very useful data. It’s going to help stratify who might benefit,” said Dr. Karen Aspry of the Lifespan Cardiovascular Institute in Providence, Rhode Island, who was not connected with the analysis.   “Patients come in, they have questions, and clinicians are often left scratching their heads because they think the data are all over the place,” she said. “This gives them some guideposts and a framework so they can say, for this patient it’s a good idea, and for this other patient it’s not a good idea because we don’t have enough data yet.”   Supplement use may be common but there is a lack of evidence of benefit in the general population, said Siscovick, who is senior vice president for research at the New York Academy of Medicine in New York City.   For most diseases, the evidence that omega-3 supplements offer a benefit is sketchy.   In contrast, there is evidence that a diet rich in real fish lowers the risk of death. That’s why the AHA recommends that people eat at least one or two servings of fatty fish each week.   In the new advisory, “we’re not talking about dietary intake. We’re talking about the use of fish oil supplements,” Siscovick said. “People may view supplementation as the same as dietary intake of fish but it isn’t.”   In its recommendation on heart failure, which occurs when the heart can’t pump blood efficiently, the advisory panel focused on a large 2008 study that found 840 milligrams per day of omega-3 fish oil cut the rate of hospitalization by 8 percent and the death rate from heart failure by 9 percent, compared to people receiving olive oil supplements.   The group also concluded there is no evidence that fish oil supplements protect diabetics or people at risk for diabetes from heart disease, or that fish oil supplements taken by the general population prevent strokes, recurrent atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat) or atrial fibrillation after heart surgery.    The authors were unable to make recommendations for these groups because there were no randomized controlled trials examining whether supplements work for them. Trials currently in progress may offer new evidence, they write.   Members of the review panel were divided on the question of whether the supplements help people at high risk for heart disease. But most concluded that fish oil treatment was not warranted.   Studies typically use 1,000 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids a day. Some supplement products advertised as 1000 mg of fish oil actually contain a much smaller amount of omega-3 fatty acids.   The Siscovick team also noted that even in the few cases where fish oil supplements might be benefiting people, the newer research isn’t showing the same degree of protection that older studies suggested.   That could be due to greater consumption of fish by the general public or a broader use of heart drugs such as statins, beta-blockers and aspirin, they said.   Aspry, director of Lifespan’s Lipid and Prevention Program, agreed. “When you start adding fish oils on top of modern therapies, the positive effect of fish oils is much smaller.”  "
2mjVBbe,2017-03-13,Social media linked to feelings of isolation in real life," (Reuters Health) - Young adults who spend more time on social media may end up feeling more isolated in their daily lives, a recent study suggests.    Researchers focused on how often users of services like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, Vine and LinkedIn experienced what’s known as social isolation - when a person lacks a sense of belonging, connections with others and fulfilling personal relationships.    Compared with people who spend no more than a half hour on social media each day, people who devoted at least two hours daily to these platforms were roughly twice as likely to report feelings of social isolation, the study found.   “These results might be a bit of a cautionary tale,” said lead study author Dr. Brian Primack, director of the Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health at the University of Pittsburgh.    That’s because social isolation is associated with worse health outcomes, including the potential for people to have worse symptoms of certain diseases and worse survival odds.    The study doesn’t prove social media causes isolation, and it’s possible that people who already felt less connected to other people in real life spent more time on services like Facebook or Twitter, researchers note in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.    “It may also be that people who use social media a lot tend to feel like everyone else is strongly connected to each other, because everyone tends to put on their best face for social media,” Primack added by email. “Then, in comparison, they might feel that they themselves are more socially isolated.”   Primack and colleagues surveyed 1,787 adults aged 19 to 32 in 2014 about their use of the 11 most popular social media platforms at the time: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Google Plus, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, Tumblr, Pinterest, Vine and LinkedIn.   About half of participants were men and half women, and they were selected to be reflective of U.S. demographics, including ethnic and racial groups, education and income levels. More than half were in committed relationships.    Roughly 26 percent of participants said they spent more than two hours a day on social media, and about 23 percent said they visited these platforms at least 58 times a week.    When people visited this often, they had about triple the odds of perceived social isolation compared to participants who said they went to social media platforms less than nine times a week.     It’s hard to say exactly why this is the case. One possibility is that people who spend hours a day on social media are not spending as much time in real-world interactions with people, the researchers speculate.    It’s possible, the authors admit, that survey participants didn’t accurately report on their level of social media use or their feelings of isolation. The findings for young adults also might not reflect what would happen with older people.    Previous research looking at social media and wellbeing has had mixed results, notes Holly Shakya, a public health researcher at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, who wasn’t involved in the study.    Another drawback of the current study is that it doesn’t look at how close people are in real life with their social media friends, Shakya added by email. There’s some evidence that social media use among people who have close relationships in real life can help make those human connections stronger.   “In that sort of case, the social media use is strengthening strongly held legitimate relationships rather than replacing them,” Shakya said. “When you have 500 Facebook friends, most of them are not close friends, so you are bombarded with information and life experiences of people you don’t know that well and with whom you have little social capital.”   Rather than get rid of social media, the findings suggest that users should be conscious of how much time they spend with virtual friends, Primack said.    “Hopefully, (the study results) will help people to think about their own social media use critically and make sure the ways they use social media are truly making their lives better,” Primack said.

2mSqqqx,2017-03-13,"Baby gear injuries surging, often due to falls"," (Reuters Health) - - Every eight minutes in the U.S., a child under three has an accident related to baby products like strollers, carriers, cribs and walkers, a study suggests.                     A man runs with his son in a stroller, during a pouring rain in Manhattan, New York, U.S., August 20, 2016. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz      That adds up to more than 66,000 injuries a year on average, and it only counts infants and toddlers who visit the emergency room. Injuries are on the rise, and roughly four in five are due to falls, researchers report in Pediatrics.    “What’s surprising is how many children are still experiencing nursery product-related injuries serious enough to result in a trip to the emergency department - one every eight minutes,” said senior study author Dr. Gary Smith, director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.    Concussions and other head injures appear to be driving the surge in emergency room visits, Smith added by email.    “This increase parallels an increase in awareness on a national level about concussions, especially sports-related concussions, and the potential consequences,” Smith said.    For the study, Smith and colleagues examined emergency room data on injuries associated with baby gear from 1991 to 2011.    During the early years of the study there was a significant decline in injuries, which researchers attributed to fewer accidents associated with baby walkers. In the last eight years of the study, however, the number of injuries surged by 24 percent.   Overall there were almost 1.4 million injuries related to baby gear during the study period, researchers estimate.   The most common culprit was baby carriers, which accounted for almost 20 percent of the accidents. Injuries may happen when parents don’t use buckles and safety straps properly, or when infants are placed on a high surface like a table or counter instead of on the floor, doctors say.   Cribs, mattresses and bedding were a close second, accounting for 19 percent of injuries. Drop-side cribs were banned in 2011 because of the high injury rate associated with these moving parts, and doctors also started telling parents to avoid soft crib bumpers that year. Soft bedding, pillows, blankets and stuffed animals can cause suffocation and other injuries, as can ill-fitting or soft mattresses.    Strollers were involved in 17 percent of injuries. Parents can prevent accidents by using buckles and straps to keep babies secure, and reduce the odds of toppling strollers by storing bags underneath instead of hanging off the back. Wider wheel bases are also safer, and parents should use wheel locks to keep strollers in place when they’re parked.    Toys like walkers, jumpers and exercisers were associated with 16 percent of the accidents in the study.    Accidents declined during the earlier years of the study in large part because walkers got safer, Smith said.    “Stationary activity centers, such as the Exersaucer, came onto the market, which are baby walker-like products without wheels,” Smith said. “This gave parents a safer alternative.”   One limitation of the study is that it only looked at emergency room visits, and likely underestimated the total number of injuries, the authors note. The study also lacks data on what caused injuries.    Carriers, for example, aren’t a problem when they’re used properly, said Dr. Elizabeth Powell, a pediatrics researcher at Northwestern University in Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study.    “As an ED clinician, I see infants who are not properly restrained, or those who fall from carriers placed on counters, beds or other furniture,” Powell said by email. “While this detail is outside the scope of the report, this is why there are injuries associated with this product.”   Rising injury rates in recent years might mean at least some parents are busier and more distracted than in the past, said Dr. Tanya Altmann, founder of Calabasas Pediatrics in California and a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.    “I see more and more parents at the park or out and about with their babies, not interacting with their babies but with their face in their phone,” Altmann, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “A reaching or grabbing baby trying to get their parents’ attention is often when falls and accidents occur.”  "
2lLuWYN,2017-03-10,Few teens receive effective treatment for opioid addiction," (Reuters Health) - Just a small fraction of adolescents with opioid addiction will receive medications that can help them quit, new research shows.   These medications, usually methadone or suboxone, are prescribed to reduce craving for opiates and ease withdrawal symptoms, and studies show they help opiate users to abstain. In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics advised doctors to consider medication-assisted treatment, specifically suboxone, for adolescents with “severe opioid use disorders.”   To get a “baseline” sense of medication-assisted treatment in adolescents with opiate or heroin addiction, Kenneth Feder of Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore and his colleagues looked at data on 139,092 patients receiving treatment at publicly funded programs in the United States in 2013.   While 26 percent of adult heroin addicts received medication-assisted treatment, that was true for just 2 percent of adolescents.   Among patients addicted to opiates, 12 percent of adults received medication, compared to less than 1 percent of adolescents, the researchers reported in the Journal of Adolescent Health.   “There’s more that needs to be done across the board to facilitate access to these treatments when they’re medically necessary,” Feder told Reuters Health by phone. “The best validated treatment for somebody struggling with an opiate addiction is treatment that includes some sort of medication assistance.”   Patients seeking medication-assisted treatment face a number of obstacles. Methadone is only offered at specific substance abuse treatment centers, and these centers need a waiver to treat anyone under 18. Also, Medicaid rules state that adolescents with opiate addiction must have failed treatment twice in order to be prescribed methadone. Doctors can prescribe suboxone, the other main drug for this purpose, to patients 16 and older, but only if they have a waiver.   “These treatments may not be covered by a state’s Medicaid program,” Feder added. “And if they are medically necessary, we think they should be covered by a state’s Medicaid program.”   The difference in medication-assisted treatment rates between adolescents and adults is “really striking and very concerning,” Dr. Lisa Marsch of Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth in Lebanon, New Hampshire, told Reuters Health by phone. Marsch has studied medication-assisted treatment but did not participate in the new study.   Medication-assisted treatment is clearly more effective for adults and adolescents, Marsch said, and by not extending the treatment to more patients, “we are doing a real disservice based on the science and the data.”   About a half-million US adolescents use prescription opiates every year, and just under 10% will become addicted, Marsch added. “We want a chance to stop this problem early.”  "
2lLSlsN,2017-03-10,Adults who were preemies may face more mental health risks," (Reuters Health) - Adults who were born prematurely at a very low birth weight may be more likely to experience mental health problems like depression and anxiety, a recent study suggests.   Researchers examined data from previously published studies of mental health in 747 adults who were underweight preemies and 1,512 who were full-term infants in five different countries. They found that former preemies reported more avoidant behaviors and more so-called “internalizing” issues like depression, anxiety, withdrawal and loneliness than adults who were full term infants.    Those who were among the smallest of the preemies reported fewer so-called “externalizing” issues like physical aggression, disobeying rules, cheating, stealing, and property destruction than the adults who were born full term.   “We have been able to show that adults born preterm at very low birth weight reported more internalizing and socially avoidant personality problems, and less externalizing problems than their peers born full term,” said lead study author Riikka Pyhala of the University of Helsinki in Finland.    “This means that they are more withdrawn and experience more emotional problems which often manifest as depressive or anxiety problems, and they (are also less likely to express) socially unacceptable behavior such as rule-breaking and intrusive behavior,” Pyhala added by email.    Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born after 37 weeks are considered full term. In the weeks immediately after birth, premature babies often have difficulty breathing and digesting food. They can also encounter longer-term challenges such as impaired vision, hearing, and cognitive skills as well as social and behavioral problems.   Most full term babies weigh around 6 to 9 pounds - 2,700 to 4,000 grams. The study looked at babies considered very low birth weight - no more than about 1,500 grams or 3.3 pounds - or extremely low birth weight - no more than about 2.2 pounds or 1,000 grams.   For the study, researchers examined data on mental health issues reported when the preemies and full term babies were about 23 years old on average.    The full term babies weighted about 7.7 pounds (3,500 grams) on average, while the preemies in the study typically weighed around 2.5 pounds (1,120 grams).   While the study didn’t examine why preemies might grow up to be more prone to certain psychiatric problems as adults, it’s possible that this might be explained by neurobiological, hormonal or social and psychological processes that are impacted by an early birth, the authors conclude.    One limitation of the study is that researchers relied on data that adults reported about their own feelings and symptoms, which isn’t always as reliable as medical records or details verified by a doctor’s diagnosis, the authors note in Pediatrics. Researchers also lacked data on childhood or adolescent mental health.    Most of the results in the current also appear tied to just one of the studies in the analysis, noted Dr. Margaret Kern, a psychology researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia who wasn’t involved in the study.    “While they claim their findings point to a universal effect, evidence for this is weak at best,” Kern said by email.    It’s also possible that parents of the preemies in the study were extra protective of their children and helped buffer them from some of the potential mental health effects of an early arrival, Kern said.   “Early development and risk for mental health illnesses are a combination of both nature and nurture,” Kern added.    Very preterm birth can disrupt normal development of the brain and other physiological systems that support emotional and behavioral regulation, however, and in that respect the study findings make sense, said Dr. Bob Joseph, a neurobiology researcher at Boston University School of Medicine.   “As the authors note, one of the main lines of current research is to understand how damaging neural inflammation in the very preterm neonate operates and can be controlled and tempered immediately after birth,” Joseph, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

2m7etKo,2017-03-10,Support programs help moms extend breastfeeding time," (Reuters Health) - Support programs for new mothers help them to breastfeed their babies for longer periods and to keep breast milk as the baby’s only source of nutrition, according to a new review of existing evidence.   The researchers concluded that breastfeeding support - whether educational or just encouraging - by trained professionals or lay people generally benefited women and their babies.   “Breastfeeding is really important,” said lead author Alison McFadden, who directs the Mother and Infant Research Unit at the University of Dundee in the UK. “Good support will help mothers to breastfeed longer and breastfeed exclusively, which of course is good for mothers and babies.”   McFadden and her colleagues are part of the international Cochrane network of researchers who analyze evidence on health topics. Their new review was published in the Cochrane Library.   The World Health Organization recommends that babies be breastfed exclusively for the first six months of life and then given breast milk along with other food until they’re two years old.   Babies who are breastfed are less likely to develop infections, become overweight and develop diabetes, the researchers write.   “For women, it reduces the incidence of breast and ovarian cancer and diabetes,” McFadden told Reuters Health.   For the review, the researchers analyzed 73 studies that compared women who received breastfeeding support to women who received no support or a different kind of intervention. Overall, 75,000 women and their babies were included in the analysis. Most were from high- to middle-income countries.   Support can come in many forms, the authors say - including reassurance, praise, information and the opportunities to discuss problems and ask questions.   Women who received support were about 8 percent less likely to stop breastfeeding before six months, compared to women who didn’t get the added help.   For every 1,000 women who received the added help, 304 stopped breastfeeding by four to six weeks and 510 stopped breastfeeding by six months, whereas for every 1,000 women who didn’t receive support, 353 stopped within four to six weeks and 573 stopped by six months.   Also, 732 of every 1,000 women who received supported were no longer exclusively breastfeeding at six months, while the same was true for 823 of every 1,000 “unsupported” women.   Certain factors may make the support more valuable for mothers and babies, the researchers found.   For example, it didn’t matter whether a healthcare professional or a trained lay person delivered the support. But, McFadden said, “it needs to be offered, proactive and scheduled so mothers know when to expect support.”   Additionally, face-to-face contact and support appeared to be better than help delivered over the phone.   “The people we’re hoping will take note of this are those providing the breastfeeding support – the health professional and the people making health policy,” said McFadden.   The next step for this type of research would be to make these support services available to a large number of women.   For new parents and parents-to-be, McFadden said, it’s important to ask their healthcare providers about breastfeeding support programs.   “If that support is not available, seek it out,” she said.  "
2lHjwFi,2017-03-09,Signs may help vending machines peddle healthier snacks," (Reuters Health) - - Vending machines with healthy snacks and drinks may lure more people to buy these products with signs promoting their benefits than with price cuts for more nutritious selections, a recent study suggests.     For the study, researchers experimented with 28 food and beverage machines on a university campus for five months. They tested out three options alone or in different combinations: restocking machines with healthy options; discounts for nutritious choices; and signs touting advantages like less sugar or fewer calories.    Just cutting the price of healthier items by 25 percent didn’t sway consumers. Both unit sales and revenue fell compared to the same five-month period in the previous year.    “We were surprised that reduced cost was not a driver for people to select the healthier snacks and beverages,” said senior study author Jeannette Ickovics, a public health researcher at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.    Researchers had expected each of the three options to independently inspire healthier food and beverage selections, Ickovics and colleagues note in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.    They also hypothesized that the combination of all three interventions - restocking, discounts and signs - would have the greatest influence on consumers.    What they found instead was that the picture looked different for snacks than for beverages, and that restocking and promotional signs helped more than price.   In snack machines, adding healthier items and discounting these products was associated with sales of 460 more units during the study period than the same period a year earlier. This combination also resulted in increased revenue of $1,039.    With beverage machines, restocking with healthier options and posting signs was associated with increased sales of 204 units. In beverage machines that discounted healthy choices in addition to doing these two other things, sales only increased by 66 units over the previous year.    Before the experiment, the best-selling snacks were Twix, Snickers, MandM Peanuts, Doritos Nacho Cheese and Planters Nuts and Chocolate Trail Mix - none meet the “FitPick” nutrition standards laid out by the National Automatic Merchandising Association. These standards, for example, require snacks to be no more than 250 calories with no more than 20 grams of sugar and 10 grams of fat.   During the study, all of the top sellers met these nutrition standards: Whole Grain Pop-Tarts Cinnamon, Sun Chips, Doritos Reduced Fat Nacho Cheese, Snyder’s Honey Mustard Pretzels and Lay’s Oven Baked Barbecue Flavored Potato Crisps.    All the top-selling beverages before the experiment were sodas: Diet Coke, Coke and Coke Zero. During the study, these remained best sellers but Dasani water also made the list.    “Sometimes all we need is a little ‘nudge’ with some promotional signs reminding us to make the healthier choice - products lower in sugar, salt and fat,” Ickovics said by email.    Limitations of the study include its small size and the possibility that at least some of the shifts in vending machine purchases might be due to the novelty of new items and not a sustained effort by consumers to buy healthier things, the authors note.    Previous research has shown price manipulations can impact people’s food choices, including what they buy from vending machines, noted Myles Faith, an education researcher at the University of Buffalo in New York.    In the current study, it’s possible signs provided an “environmental nudge” to buy better things than merely stocking healthy snacks could accomplish on its own, Faith, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.      “People often approach vending machines in a rush and pressed to make a selection without much thinking, almost in autopilot,” Faith added. “However, as this study shows, there can be a range of healthier selections in some vending machines if one slows down to look carefully.”   Signs can help with that.    “There were no nutrition lectures, podcasts, or quizzes in this present study, just simple signs,” Faith said. “The simplicity of the signs is the beauty.”  "
2mLBVxt,2017-03-09,TV may take biggest toll on school readiness for poor kids," (Reuters Health) - - Doctors often tell parents of young children to limit television time because it can interfere with learning and language development. Now, a U.S. study suggests TV’s impact on school readiness might be worse for poor kids than for more affluent children.                     Kevin Lachaise, 8, watches a recorded TV show through the screen of a computer at the living room of his home in downtown Havana February 10, 2015. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini      Researchers examined test results for 807 kids between 5 and 6 years old assessed at the start of kindergarten for basic skills like counting, letter recognition and sorting blocks by pattern and shape. They also looked at parent surveys about how much time each day kids spent watching traditional television sets or other screens.     For kids at the highest income levels, there wasn’t any connection between the amount of TV children watched and how well they did on the tests. More television time was tied to just a modest drop in test results for students from average income households - about $74,000 a year for a family of four.    Children at or near the poverty line, about $21,200 a year for a family of four, had a pronounced drop in test scores when they watched a lot of TV each day.   “Watching too much TV - here more than 2 hours per day - was negatively associated with the development of mathematical abilities and executive function - skills engaged in the pursuit of goals, including inhibition, attention, working memory, and cognitive flexibility,” said lead study author Andrew Ribner, a psychology and education researcher at New York University.    “We find some evidence that the negative association of television viewing with math ability is at least partially through executive function, which others have shown is strongly related to math ability throughout the academic life span,” Ribner added by email.    Last year, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that preschoolers watch no more than an hour of TV a day; down from two hours in 2001 guidelines.    Parents should watch with kids and show them only “high quality” programing like Sesame Workshop and PBS, the AAP recommends.    It’s possible that some of the differences in how much television time influences school readiness for rich versus poor kids in the study might be explained by the type of content children watch, Ribner said.    Children in the study watched an average of 2.2 hours of television a day, Ribner and colleagues report in the Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics.    Researchers didn’t have data on the type of programing children watched and they also didn’t know anything about viewing circumstances to see if parents were in the room or what else was happening around kids while the TV was on.    The study also wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how television time directly influences school readiness.    It’s possible that at least some of the problem with too much TV is it takes time away from other activities, said Dr. Caroline Kistin, a pediatrics researcher at Boston University School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Parents should be aware that the highest-level skills that help children succeed in school, including decision-making, critical thinking, and the ability to control emotions, are best taught through interactive play, not with television, videos, or apps,” Kistin said by email. “Limiting screen time to one hour per day would ensure that there is time available for more engaging activities.”   Ideally, for every half hour of television children should get at least two hours of other activities that provide opportunities to interact with their parents and other kids, said Larry Rosen, professor emeritus at California State University Dominguez Hills.    When kids do watch, it would be better developmentally if parents sat with them and paused sometimes to talk about what’s happening on the screen, Rosen said. Otherwise there’s little chance to build thinking or social skills.    “If children are simply watching entertainment shows without parental co-viewing and conversation or peer interaction, this negatively impacts both of those necessary skills,” Rosen said.

2lEdxAV,2017-03-08,Quality of life after heart CT scan depends on results," (Reuters Health) - Improvement or worsening of chest pain symptoms and quality of life after a CT scan of the heart may depend on what the scan finds, a large study suggests.                    Siemens logo is pictured on a CT scan in the manufacturing plant of Siemens Healthineers in Forchheim near Nuremberg, Germany, October 7, 2016. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle      People who have coronary artery disease ruled out by the scan benefit, and so do those with severe blockages diagnosed, while those who have moderate artery disease confirmed may only become more anxious after the scan, researchers found.   Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), is a high-resolution X-ray of the heart that can be used to diagnose the reason for angina, or chest pain, symptoms and clarify what other treatments might be needed.   “Patients with normal coronary arteries or those with severe coronary artery disease seemed to get the most benefit in quality of life and did best,” senior study author Dr. David E. Newby from University/BHF Center for Cardiovascular Science in Edinburgh, told Reuters Health.    “This suggests that being reassured that all is normal is highly valued by patients and CTCA really helps provide this reassurance. Conversely, knowing the cause of your symptoms is due to coronary heart disease and patients undergo treatment for it, is also very helpful,” he said by email.    Although getting CTCA is associated with a lower likelihood of having a heart attack later on, its effects on symptoms and quality of life may vary, the researchers note in the journal Heart.   Newby and his team assessed how CTCA affected symptoms and quality of life six weeks and six months after the scan for 4,146 patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease.    When the CTCA results revealed something less than a blockage, so-called nonobstructive disease, as the cause for the patient’s chest pain, patients’ quality of life got worse in the following weeks and months.   This reflects the fact that the cause of the symptoms had been unknown before and in addition they now have heart artery disease that needs treatment, Newby said.    The findings were similar when it came to changes in symptoms during follow-up. Improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions.   “Although CTCA removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks, quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease,” Newby said. “Much like screening tests for cancer, being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better,” he added.    If a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved.   “If, however, a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy, then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential CTCA findings, including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life-long preventative therapy,” Newby said. “Certainly, this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients, some of whom have declined CTCA.”    “It was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a (treatable) diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis, rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se,” said Dr. Paula M. C. Mommersteeg from the Center of Research on Psychology in Somatic Diseases, Tilburg University, The Netherlands, who has investigated associations between personality traits and coronary artery disease symptoms.   “In my opinion, CTCA does have added value in the diagnostic process (improved decision making), it is less invasive than coronary angiography (CAG), and can provide more clarity in the cardiac symptoms experienced by patients,” Mommersteeg concluded.

2mdEWcl,2017-03-07,Gene activity in the nose may signal lung cancer," (Reuters Health) - Genetic changes in the cells lining the inside of the nose might someday help doctors diagnose lung cancer, a recent study suggests.   “The idea that you don’t have to sample the disease tissue but can diagnose presence of disease using relatively accessible cells that are far from the tumor . . . is a paradigm that can impact many cancers,” Dr. Avrum Spira from Boston University School of Medicine, a member of the study team, told Reuters Health by email.    The layer of cells that covers the surfaces of the body and lines the cavities is known as the epithelium. Researchers found that distinctive changes in gene activity in the nasal epithelium of lung cancer patients closely parallel the changes seen in lung epithelium and can distinguish between benign lung disease and cancer.   “I think the most interesting finding was the genomic changes in the nasal epithelium of lung cancer patients mirror so closely those found in the lower airway,” Spira said.    The researchers thought the nose would be “a reasonable surrogate for the ‘field of injury’ in the bronchial airway,” he added, but the surprisingly strong concordance between the nose and lower airway gave them the encouragement to develop a nasal biomarker for lung cancer detection.    “Pulmonary nodules represent a growing diagnostic dilemma in the U.S. as we have started to screen for lung cancer,” Spira said. “A nasal swab that is highly sensitive for lung cancer in this setting would enable physicians to avoid unnecessary invasive biopsies in nodule patients who are unlikely to have lung cancer.”    Past research has found that gene expression profiles from normal bronchial epithelial cells can distinguish smokers and former smokers with lung cancer from individuals with benign lung disease, and that nasal and bronchial epithelium respond similarly to tobacco smoke.   Spira’s team sought to determine whether cancer-associated gene expression in the nasal epithelium might be useful for detecting lung cancer in current and former smokers.   They identified 535 genes that had different activity patterns in the nasal epithelium of patients with lung cancer versus those with benign disease.    Cancer-associated gene changes correlated significantly between nasal epithelium and bronchial epithelium samples, and the genes that were more active in nasal epithelium of patients with lung cancer were among the genes whose activity was most increased in bronchial epithelium of patients with cancer.    When researchers compared models doctors might use to determine the likelihood of lung cancer, nasal gene activity was more accurate than clinical risk factors alone for diagnosing lung cancer, according to the Journal of the National Cancer Institute report.   The combination of clinical factors and gene activity score accurately predicted cancer 91 percent of the time, compared to 79 percent for the model based on risk factors. The combined model also had 85 percent accuracy differentiating lung cancer from benign disease, compared to 73 percent.   “One of the big-picture messages for physicians is that molecular tests like this one are emerging as part of precision medicine approaches for early cancer detection,” Spira said.

2li9vdt,2017-03-07,"After insurance reform, fewer pregnant women have scheduled deliveries"," (Reuters Health) - Low-income pregnant women in Texas were up to 14 percent less likely to deliver babies unnecessarily early after the state’s Medicaid insurance program stopped paying for preterm elective births in 2011, a new study shows.   Babies were born five days later and six ounces heavier in Texas on average than in a group of comparison states that continued to pay doctors and hospitals for scheduled, or elective, early deliveries, according to a report released Monday in Health Affairs.    Infants born after a full 39-week term are more likely to thrive, previous studies have shown. But doctors deliver 1 in 10 American babies early - either by inducing labor, performing a cesarean section, or both - in cases that fail to justify early intervention, the authors write.   “Payment reform was an effective tool in reducing early elective deliveries,” lead author Heather Dahlen said in a phone interview.    Reducing elective early deliveries could potentially yield important gains in newborns’ outcomes, said Dahlen, who is a health economist and a research fellow at Medica Research Institute in Minnetonka, Minnesota.   The high rate of preterm births in the U.S. has been a major factor in its infant mortality ranking, which is near the bottom of industrialized nations, the authors write.   Researchers analyzed birth certificate data for all Medicaid-financed single births in Texas as well as in comparison states from before payment reform in 2009 until afterward, in 2013.    Refusal to pay for medically unnecessary early deliveries appeared to have the largest impact on minorities in Texas, with rates falling more than twice as much for Latinos as for whites, mirroring differences seen in previous research.   Dr. Lisa Hollier, an obstetrician who has championed reductions in early elective deliveries, was pleased about the study’s finding of a 10 to 14 percent drop in unnecessary early elective deliveries, she said in a phone interview. A professor at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, she was not involved in the new study.   But she expressed concern about another of the study’s findings - a small reduction in the number of early deliveries that were deemed medically necessary.    “We don’t want to see doctors avoiding appropriate deliveries,” she said. “As a clinician, I really have to balance the risks of waiting versus the risks of delivery now for this mom and baby.”   Before pronouncing the new law a success, she wants to see additional data on the number of medically necessary early deliveries and the number of newborns admitted to intensive-care units.   In 2011, Texas became the first state to eliminate Medicaid payment for medically unnecessary early elective deliveries before 39 weeks gestation. Five other states - Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, New York and South Carolina - followed suit in 2013.    Because Medicaid pays for about half of all U.S. deliveries, similar policy changes in other states have the potential to significantly lower rates of early elective deliveries, the authors conclude.   But Dr. Elliott Main of Stanford University in California, one of the leaders in the movement to reduce early elective deliveries, is skeptical.   Main, who wasn’t involved in the current analysis, criticized it as “messy” because it relied on birth certificate data, which can be inaccurate.    Like most physicians, he prefers to see doctors, not lawmakers, regulating his trade.   “There are lots of tools you have to try to change practice,” he said in a phone interview. “If these don’t work, then you have to resort to a law.”   Collaborative efforts have significantly cut early elective delivery rates in every state over the past 10 years, Main said. California’s rate has plummeted, he said, but doctors in a few private, independent hospitals have continued to deliver babies unnecessarily early.   Main sees the bulk of the problem outside the Medicaid population. “It’s not nearly as big an issue nationwide in Medicaid patients as it is in commercial patients, white college-educated women who want to schedule their deliveries and also doctors who take care of those women,” he said.   Some private-paying expectant mothers bond with their obstetricians and want them to deliver their babies, rather than another doctor who might be on call at the time. Consequently, Main said, “there’s a lot of tendency to fudge the rules.”  "
2mtkC6R,2017-03-06,Soy tied to longer life after breast cancer," (Reuters Health) - - Eating more soy may be tied to better survival odds for many women with breast cancer and may not be harmful for patients treated with hormones, a new study suggests.                     Soybean plant is seen in a field in Hernandarias, Paraguay February 6, 2017. Picture taken February 6, 2017.   REUTERS/Jorge Adorno      Previous nutrition research has linked soy to a longer life, but prior studies have also suggested soy may help tumors spread by making hormone-based cancer treatments, or endocrine therapy, less effective.     For the current study, researchers examined data on 6,235 U.S. and Canadian women with breast cancer. More than half of the women were followed for at least nine years.   During the course of the study, women who ate the most foods containing soy were 21 percent less likely to die than individuals who consumed the smallest amounts of soy.    “All women or all breast cancer survivors can add soy as a component of a healthy diet,” said lead study author Dr. Fang Fang Zhang, a nutrition and science policy researcher at Tufts University in Boston.    The study focused on isoflavone, a compound in soybeans that can be found in foods like tofu, miso, edamame and soy milk. Isoflavone is in a family of plant compounds known as phytoestrogens that are chemically and structurally similar to the female sex hormone estrogen.    Researchers found the strongest link between soy and survival for women with certain aggressive forms of breast cancer that can’t be treated with hormones. They didn’t see a link between soy consumption and longevity for women with tumors that depend on estrogen to grow or women receiving endocrine therapy.   “Our findings, taken together, indicate that soy food consumption does not have a harmful effect for women treated with endocrine therapies, but the benefit may be limited to women with negative tumor hormone receptors or those who were not treated with endocrine therapies,” Zhang added by email.    For the study, researchers examined data from dietary questionnaires for women diagnosed with breast cancer from 1996 to 2011. They excluded women who died within one year of completing the first questionnaire.    At the start, women were 52 years old on average and most had at least some education beyond high school.    About 47 percent took hormone therapy for tumors.    On average, women consumed 1.8 milligrams of isoflavone daily, roughly the amount in one ounce of soy cheese and far less than a 3-ounce serving of tofu or a half-cup portion of edamame.    During the study, 1,224 women died.    Overall, women with the highest quartile of dietary isoflavone intake, an average of at least 1.5 milligrams a day, were 21 percent less likely to die than women in the lowest quartile who got less than 0.3 milligrams a day, researchers report in Cancer.    For women with tumors not fueled by hormones, the highest amount of isoflavone intake was tied to 51 percent lower odds of death from all causes.    Among women who didn’t receive hormone therapy, the highest level of dietary isoflavone was associated with 32 percent lower odds of death from all causes.    One limitation of the study is that women who ate more foods with soy tended to be more affluent and educated, with healthier lifestyles, making it possible that other factors beyond dietary isoflavone influences longevity, the authors note.    Researchers also lacked data on the type and length of hormone therapy for women who received this treatment, which could also impact survival odds.    Still, the findings build on previous research in Asia that linked high dietary soy intake to a lower risk of developing breast cancer, said Dr. Omer Kucuk, a researcher at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University in Atlanta.   “It is not surprising that this study showed women in North America also benefit from soy intake with reduced mortality from breast cancer while on treatment,” Kucuk, author of an accompanying editorial, said by email.    “Up until now physicians generally discouraged their breast cancer patients from eating soy foods because of potential harm,” Kucuk said. “We can now encourage women with breast cancer to eat soy foods because it is safe and it will likely improve their survival.”  "
2mnfbX6,2017-03-03,Obese people may get less &#039;comfort care&#039; at the end of life," (Reuters Health) - - Obese people in the U.S. may not receive the same kind of care at the end of their lives as people who are thin or normal weight, suggests a new study.   Before they died, obese patients were less likely to enroll in hospice care, spent less time in hospice and were less likely to die at home than thinner people, researchers found.    End-of-life care was also more costly for obese people.   “People with obesity deserve high-quality care, but may not be receiving it at the end of life,” said lead author Dr. John Harris, of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pennsylvania.   More than a third of U.S. adults are obese, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   Harris and his colleagues note in the Annals of Internal Medicine that aside from health risks, obesity may present technical and logistical challenges during physical examinations and certain medical procedures.   Previous research also shows that stigma about weight affects how doctors and patients behave, they write.   To see how body weight is linked to healthcare at the end of life, the researchers used data collected between 1998 and 2012 from 5,677 people on Medicare, the U.S. government’s health insurance program for the elderly and disabled.   None of the participants were living in nursing homes or other institutions. The data were drawn from the last six months of their lives.   Based on body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight in relation to height, 7 percent of participants were underweight with a BMI of 18.5 or below, 44 percent were normal weight with a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, 31 percent were overweight with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 and the rest were obese or morbidly obese with a BMI of at least 30.   A 5-foot-5-inch person weighing 120 pounds would have a BMI of 20, in the normal range. A person of the same height who weighed 240 pounds would be morbidly obese, with a BMI of about 40. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute provides a BMI calculator online ( bit.ly/2lHXqP2 ).   The researchers found a 38 percent probability that people with a BMI of 20 would enter hospice care toward the end of life, compared to about 23 percent among people with a BMI of 40.   Hospice care, which can be provided in home or at a facility, provides physical support, including pain control, and emotional support for patients and families dealing with terminal illnesses.   When people with a BMI of 40 did receive hospice care, it was typically for a shorter time than normal-weight people.    “It’s looks like people weren’t getting enrolled, and they got there later if they were enrolled,” Harris told Reuters Health.   The researchers also found that obese people had lower odds of dying at home, which is a typically a wish for people at the end of life. Their likelihood of dying at home was 55 percent, compared to 61 percent for normal-weight patients.   Gaps in care generally rose as BMI increased, the researchers found.   “It seems like people with obesity are getting lower quality of care at the end of life,” said Harris.   The cost of care was also higher when BMI was higher, they found.   The study can’t say why these gaps exist, but the researchers suggest it may have to do with obese people looking less gaunt toward the end of life and not being referred for hospice. Or, they may be unable to find a hospice program that can accommodate their healthcare and family’s needs.   The healthcare systems needs to make sure it’s offering everyone the same level of care, said Harris.   His overarching goal, Harris said, is to improve the quality of care for people with obesity.

2m3Jy2B,2017-03-03,U.S. sunscreens may not meet European standards," (Reuters Health) - While most high-SPF sunscreens in the U.S. meet national standards for ultraviolet A (UVA) protection, about half don’t meet European standards, a recent study found.   U.S. regulations recognize the importance of blocking a wide range of UV wavelengths to reduce skin cancer risk, but the standards may not be high enough to meet that goal, researchers say.   Currently, U.S. products only measure SPF based on protection against ultraviolet B rays, which cause sunburn. This number doesn’t say much about protection against ultraviolet A light, which is linked to aging, wrinkling and skin cancer.    Many sunscreens with sun protection factor (SPF) 50 or above and labeled “broad spectrum” - because they protect against both UVA and UVB rays - didn’t meet the higher standards created by the European Union, which may indicate a need for new UV filters in U.S. products, the study team writes in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.   “I work with melanoma patients every day, and I’m a big believer in sunscreen use. When used correctly, daily use decreases skin cancer and prevents signs of early aging,” lead study author Steven Wang of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York told Reuters Health.   In recent years, U.S. researchers have paid more attention to joint UVA and UVB protection, and the Food and Drug Administration issued a 2011 ruling that used “critical wavelength” to measure UVA protection. This method is more lenient than Europe’s UVA “protection factor” method.   Wang and colleagues studied 20 best-selling U.S. sunscreen products ranging from 15 to 100 SPF and marketed as broad-spectrum. They tested the products based on the critical wavelength requirement in the U.S. and the UVA protection factor test in Europe.    Nineteen of the 20 products met U.S. standards, and 11 met European standards. Of the nine products that failed EU standards, eight were SPF 50 or higher.    Part of the limitation for U.S. manufacturers is the lower number of effective long-range UVA filters available, Wang said. In addition, only 17 UV filters or active ingredients are approved for use in U.S. products.    “It’s important to revisit the issue of sunscreen innovation and add new filters into the formulation to improve protection,” Wang said. “We’re always looking for new ways to improve protection by adding inactive ingredients with a better film-forming technology.”   Several UV filters are under FDA review, including four that provide long-range UVA protection. The Sunscreen Innovation Act of 2014 was passed to expedite the review process for sunscreen additives, and eight proposed ingredients, including two common in European products, were denied in 2015 due to a lack of data to support safety. ( bit.ly/2fZ0YK3 )   In November 2016, the FDA issued new guidelines for chemical and human studies that manufacturers will need to conduct to win approval for new ingredients in over-the-counter sunscreens. In particular, companies must provide data from a “maximal usage trial” to determine whether an ingredient is absorbed into the blood.    “It’s hard for the U.S. to get that high UVA protection without new filters,” said Henry Lim of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. Lim, who wasn’t involved with the study, has previously researched UV radiation and photosensitivity.    “Essentially, sunscreens in Europe have a better probability of balanced protection, and the U.S. system is not as sensitive for UVA,” he told Reuters Health. “U.S. manufacturers are waiting for approval to create and market that better balance.”  "
2m4InBt,2017-03-03,Most older women don’t get bone tests after hip fractures," (Reuters Health) - - When older women fracture a hip, they usually don’t get bone density tests that might show whether they need treatment to help prevent more broken bones, a recent U.S. study suggests.    “Osteoporosis screening after hip fracture is so important because there are a number of highly effective and relatively low-risk treatments available that can substantially reduce future fracture risk,” said lead study author Catherine Gillespie of the AARP Public Policy Research Institute and George Washington University in Washington, D.C.   For the study, researchers examined insurance data on medical care and prescription use for 8,359 women over 50 who had a hip fracture between 2008 and 2013.    None of the women had a prior history of osteoporosis, hip fracture, or taking medications to improve bone density.    More than half of the women in the study were at least 80 years old when they first fractured their hip. Most had multiple chronic medical problems.    Within six months of experiencing their first hip fracture, just 17 percent of the women got tested for osteoporosis or received a treatment for the condition, researchers report in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research.    After one year, only 23 percent of the women had been screened or put on treatment for osteoporosis.    During the study period, use of bone mass measurement tests increased among women 65 and older but declined among women from 50 to 64.    Over the same timeframe, the rate of osteoporosis drug use remained constant for women aged 50 to 64 but declined among older women in the study.    Seeing a primary care doctor after fracture was the strongest and most consistent predictor of osteoporosis assessment or treatment, the study found. Women with private health insurance and higher income also appeared more likely to get screening and treatment.    One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on women who were uninsured or covered by Medicaid, the government health program for the poor.    They also lacked data on some interventions used to strengthen bones and help prevent future falls such as calcium and vitamin D supplements, counseling on exercise and fall prevention, or home repairs and modifications to make day-to-day life safer to navigate.    Even so, the study confirms a long recognized gap in routine osteoporosis care for patients with hip fractures, said Dr. Matthew Drake, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Almost all patients who have a hip fracture should be screened for osteoporosis as this will allow their provider to assess their bone mineral density, and will also establish a baseline so that if pharmacologic or other treatment approaches are chosen there is data against which to compare later in order to determine how the therapy is working,” Drake said by email.    “If a woman or man has a hip fracture, she/he should speak with her/his doctor about getting screened for osteoporosis and strongly consider starting therapy,” Drake added. “As this study clearly shows, this screening and treatment continues to occur at a rate which is abysmal.”  "
2lYvxVA,2017-03-03,Industry ties common among nonprofit patient advocacy groups," The March 1 story is refiled to add new final paragraph, for clarification     (Reuters Health) - An examination of more than a hundred of the largest U.S. nonprofit organizations created to improve health and fight disease has found that more than 8 in 10 get financial support from companies involved in the drug, biotechnology and medical device industry.   In addition, over a third have at least one industry official on their governing board and, in 12 percent of the 104 organizations analyzed, an industry official was listed as leading the governing board.   The tally raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest among groups that claim to be looking out for the best interest of patients but whose advocacy may be influenced by industries that have a financial interest in certain treatments.   “Concerns have been raised that industry-supported patient-advocacy organizations have spoken out for access to drugs with questionable therapeutic benefit and remained silent on policy proposals, such as drug-pricing reforms, that might benefit their constituents,” the research team from the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia writes in the New England Journal of Medicine   The influence might be even more extensive than the numbers suggest, say the authors, led by Matthew McCoy, a postdoctoral fellow in the university’s department of medical ethics and health policy.   Some of the 104 groups, all with annual revenues of more than $7.5 million, don’t publish detailed information on their sources of revenue or members of their governing board.   What was available showed that at least 39 percent of the health-oriented public advocacy groups each got a least $1 million a year from industry.   The websites of only 12 percent of the organizations posted conflict-of-interest policies for managing such potential problems.   The findings don’t necessarily mean that the organizations have been compromised, McCoy told Reuters Health.   “I don’t want to impugn them,” he said. “But I think we have a right to know more. If an organization receives more than 50 percent of its support from a drug or device company, I might take what they say with a grain of salt.”   The groups ranged from the New York-based Child Mind Institute which was the only organization of the 104 that explicitly says it does not accept industry support, to the National Hemophilia Foundation, whose 2014 annual report indicates that it received 50 percent to 83 percent of its annual revenue from drug or device companies. (Like many organizations, the foundation only reported donations in a range of dollars.)   The foundation responded to Reuters Health with a statement saying that industry officials are prohibited from serving on its board and the organization “has never and will never advocate for any single treatment or group of treatments before legislators, or public and private payers. Instead, NHF advocates for all FDA-approved therapies, and will continue to fight to ensure that individuals with bleeding disorders have access to the therapies they need.”   Eighteen groups didn’t report getting money from industry, but 13 of those provided no donor information at all.   Of 59 groups that reported the amounts of their donations, 11 received at least 10 percent of their financial support from industry donations.   They included the American Diabetes Association, the Epilepsy Foundation, the Arthritis Foundation, the National Kidney Foundation, and the National Hemophilia Foundation.   The groups that responded to a Reuters Health inquiry said those donations don’t influence policy.   For example, the Kidney Foundation, in a statement, said that although it does accept financial support from industry, “this support does not drive policy positions, priorities, mission or objectives” and the sole industry member on its 24-member board is prohibited from voting on matters related to that person’s business.   Arthritis Foundation president Ann Palmer released a statement to Reuters Health saying, “Our corporate partners pay to sponsor events and tools. To keep the needs of people with arthritis at the center of what we do, the Foundation makes advocacy and position decisions independently - our corporate partners do not shape our agenda or advocacy efforts.”   The organization would not allow industry members to be on its governing board, she said.   An earlier version of this story incorrectly listed the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association among the organizations that receive at least 10 percent of their financial support from industry. The organization tells Reuters Health that in 2016, only 1.04% of its revenue was contributed by pharmaceutical/medical device/biotech companies.  "
2luqxEj,2017-03-03,"As more hotels ban smoking, peer-to-peer rentals may draw smokers"," (Reuters Health) – - People using peer-to-peer services like Airbnb, which link potential guests to hosts offering space in their homes, can find plenty of smoking-friendly lodging, according to a recent Canadian study.   In Canada and the U.S., many major hotel chains have banned smoking, and several states prohibit smoking in all hotels.   “Hotels have increasingly gone smoke-free over the last 10 years. This is good for the staff who work in hotels and for guests,” said lead author Ryan Kennedy, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.   When it comes to regulating peer-to-peer accommodation services, the public health concern of smoke exposure should be a consideration, he and his colleagues write in the journal Tobacco Control.   Nonsmokers who use these services “should always ask if smoking is prohibited, how smoking bans are monitored and enforced, how long smoking has been prohibited, and where smokers are allowed to smoke,” said Georg Matt, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University who studies smoking restrictions but wasn’t involved in Kennedy’s research.   In April 2016, the study team searched Airbnb listings in 12 Canadian cities across all 10 of the country’s provinces. They looked for various types of lodging available in June, including private rooms and entire homes or apartments, noting whether smoking was permitted and also the price of the rooms.   Availability of smoke-friendly accommodations varied widely, and smoking-permitted lodging tended to be less expensive than smoke-free homes.   In Regina, Fredericton and Charlottetown, no listings permitted smoking. In five cities - Victoria, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa and St John’s - less than 10 percent of listings allowed guests to smoke.   In larger cities like Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, the proportion of smoking-allowed rooms was much greater, making up 18 percent, 45 percent and 69 percent of listings, respectively.    While some cities listed similar prices for smoking or non-smoking rooms, others had a significant price gap. Vancouver’s was the biggest - the average cost to rent a smoke-free private room for one night was C$128 (about $95), while the cost of a private room that allowed smoking was C$62 ($46).    The team also looked at the reviews section of each listing and noted that hosts often commented on exactly where smoking was allowed. Most specified that smoking was only allowed outside.    A few guest reviews included negative comments about smoke smell or cigarette butts in the home.    But overall, the researchers note, “Airbnb users do not commonly discuss tobacco smoke issues in the online reviews for smoking-permitted venues, suggesting guests and hosts are largely working out expectations around tobacco use.”   The Airbnb platform does not give guests the option to choose smoke-free rooms and cannot guarantee that listings are smoke-free, Matt said.   “For nonsmoking guests: concerns include exposure to third-hand smoke toxicants left behind by previous guests that have accumulated in carpets, walls, pillows, upholstery, etc.,” Matt said by email.   “For Airbnb guests - if you want to stay in a smoke-free environment be sure to ask the host explicitly if smoking ever takes place inside,” Kennedy advised in an email. “For Airbnb hosts - in most markets, not permitting smoking is associated with higher average prices and more bookings!” he added.

2mflls4,2017-03-02,"E-therapy tied to better body image, intimacy for breast cancer survivors"," (Reuters Health) - - Internet-based psychotherapy focused on changing behavior may be tied to improved body image and sexual functioning in breast cancer survivors, a recent study suggests.    Researchers randomly selected 169 breast cancer survivors diagnosed with sexual dysfunction to receive either online cognitive behavioral therapy for up to 24 weeks or to join a control group of people on a waiting list for therapy.    After 10 weeks, women in the therapy group reported bigger improvements in sexual desire and pleasure and less discomfort during sex than women on the waitlist, the study found. By the time treatment ended, women who got online therapy also reported greater improvements in desire and overall sexual functioning than women on the waitlist.    “Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy and applicability of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for female sexual dysfunctions in the general population,” said senior study author Neil Aaronson of the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam.   The current study, however, is the first to evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of this type of treatment for sexual dysfunction in female breast cancer survivors, Aaronson added by email.    “This is particularly important because the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in this population is two to three times higher than in the general population,” Aaronson said.    For the study, women in the treatment group could participate in up to 24 weekly sessions guided by a therapist. Researchers surveyed all of the participants at the start of the study, after 10 weeks and after therapy sessions concluded, with a similar schedule for women on the waiting list and patients in therapy.   Participants were 51 years old on average and most of them had a romantic partner. Slightly more than half of the women had undergone breast-conserving treatment, with a majority getting chemotherapy, radiation or hormones.   The most common type of sexual dysfunction was low desire, which affected about 83 percent of the women, followed by sexual arousal disorder, which impacted 40 percent of participants.    Overall, the odds of improved sexual functioning were more than tripled with therapy, compared with women on the waiting list.    Researchers didn’t find any meaningful differences between groups in orgasmic function, sexual satisfaction, intercourse frequency, relationship intimacy, psychological distress, marital satisfaction or health-related quality of life.    One limitation of the study is that it wasn’t designed to show whether web-based treatment might be any better or worse than in-person therapy sessions, the authors note. Another drawback is that only 62 percent of women in therapy completed the treatment cycle.    In addition, researchers didn’t have clinicians examine women at the end of the study to see how many participants still had a diagnosis of sexual dysfunction, the researchers note. A goal of treatment would be to help women improve enough to no longer meet the criteria for this diagnosis.   While the internet doesn’t allow patients to develop the same personal relationships with therapists that they can establish in the same room together, online treatment may be a more convenient and private option that some women may prefer, Aaronson said.   One potential downside to web therapy could be the lack of a therapist to visit in person when problems arise, said Dr. Christine Rini, a researcher at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey who wasn’t involved in the study.    “People using the therapy may be less likely to get help for problems such as distress or relationship conflicts caused by completing the therapy,” Rini said by email. “In an emergency, that could be a real problem.”   But web-based therapy could make treatment available to far more patients, and be more affordable than in-person visits, Rini said.    “Using the web should allow people to get this therapy even if they could not or would not attend in-person therapy,” Rini added. “People need to decide whether they prefer in-person versus web-based therapy.”  "
2mdSiF6,2017-03-02,Children of depressed mothers at risk for unintentional injuries," (Reuters Health) - Children under age 5 are more likely to accidentally get injured if their mothers are having a depression or anxiety episode, according to a study in the UK.   The rates of child poisonings, small fractures and minor burns increased during these episodes – with poisonings more than doubled when mothers suffered both depression and anxiety - but there was no link to more severe injuries such as third-degree burns or femur fractures, researchers found.   “Maternal depression and anxiety are common. Maternal well-being is key to giving children a good start in life, affecting their emotional and physical health,” said lead author Ruth Baker of the University of Nottingham.   “Injuries are still one of the leading preventable causes of death in preschool children, yet few studies have examined whether maternal mental illnesses affect that risk,” she told Reuters Health by email. “Most studies focus on depression alone.”   Baker and colleagues analyzed hospitalization data for more than 200,000 children born between 1998 and 2013 and followed them from birth through their fifth birthdays. They also identified episodes of depression and anxiety in each mother’s primary care record, as well as prescriptions for antidepressants and anxiety medications. The research team focused on poisonings, fractures and burns as the three most common preventable injuries in young children.    They found that a fourth of mothers experienced one or more depression or anxiety episodes, and unintentional injuries were higher during these periods.   More than 2,600 poisonings, 6,000 fractures and 4,200 burns were reported. Children had a 52 percent higher poisoning rate, for example, during depression episodes, a 63 percent higher poisoning rate during anxiety episodes, and a 230 percent higher poisoning rate during depression with anxiety episodes.    Similar to poisonings, fractures and burns were highest during combined depression and anxiety episodes.    “Due to depression or mental illness, these households often aren’t kept hazard-free and don’t safely store poisonous or sharp objects. Young children may also be able to access dangerous areas of the home such as stairways and windows,” said Kieran Phelan of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital in Ohio, who wasn’t involved in the study.    In the U.S., unintentional injuries may be particularly common in low-income households that don’t have access to healthcare, unlike the families who have universal healthcare access in Britain, he added.   “That’s likely to get worse in the U.S. over the next few years, given current talks of changing the healthcare system,” Phelan told Reuters Health. “It’ll make it more difficult for low-income and working moms to get insurance.”   One limitation of the study is that the researchers relied on hospitalization data and mental illness diagnoses. Many injuries likely go unreported, and many mothers likely have depression or anxiety but aren’t diagnosed by doctors, the study authors write in the journal Injury Prevention. The British database used for the study also didn’t link the health data for children to fathers or other caregivers.   “New studies are looking at the associations between paternal mental health and childhood injury, and we’re seeing that higher paternal involvement reduces injuries,” said Takeo Fujiwara of Tokyo Medical and Dental University in Japan, who wasn’t involved with the study.    “To prevent childhood injuries, we need to take care of mothers and other caregivers in terms of mental health,” Fujiwara told Reuters Health. “Few studies focus on how to really help our caregivers.”  "
2lqUdlR,2017-03-02,Herbal medications risky in heart disease," (Reuters Health) - Herbal medications offer few benefits and many risks for people with heart disease, according to a recent review.   “It is key that patients inform their doctors about the use of herbal medications and ask about harmful effects of herbal medications and possible interactions with other medications they are using,” Dr. Graziano Onder from A. Gemelli University Hospital, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Rome told Reuters Health. “This is particularly important for older adults who are often taking multiple medications.”    One of every five persons in the U.S. admits to taking herbal or dietary supplements at some point in his or her life, and this is a particular concern for people with heart disease.    Onder’s team looked at the evidence for the safety and effectiveness of herbal medications for people with cardiovascular disease and found no herbal medication for which there is clear and convincing evidence of any benefit when used in people with heart disease.   There was limited evidence of possible benefits from flaxseed oil, milk thistle, grape seeds, green tea, hawthorn, garlic and soy, they report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. But this was tempered by evidence of a high risk of interactions with heart medications with green tea, hawthorn and garlic.    Among other commonly used herbal medications, astragalus appeared to have either no evidence or conflicting evidence of benefit and limited side effects. Asian ginseng had no benefits and a high risk of interaction with heart medications, and Ginkgo biloba had evidence of potentially severe side effects and a high risk of interactions with heart medications.    A number of other herbal medications, such as cranberry, European elder, goldenseal, licorice root, salvia miltiorrhiza and St. John’s wort have significant interactions with prescription drugs commonly used to treat heart disease, including Warfarin, diuretics, aspirin and other anticoagulants.   Unfortunately, your doctor may not be aware of many of these effects. “So far, in most western countries, the study of alternative medicine is not imbedded in the medical school,” Onder said by email. “Therefore, it is necessary that physicians improve their knowledge on herbal medications in order to adequately assess the clinical implications related to their use.”    It’s important to know “that ‘natural does not mean safe’ and that herbal medications might lead to severe side effects,” he added.

2lAjPxs,2017-03-02,"Home-cooked meals, hold the TV, linked to less obesity"," (Reuters Health) - Adults who never watch TV during family meals and eat mostly home-cooked food are much less likely than others to be obese, according to a recent U.S. study.   Past research has suggested that more frequent family meals are linked to lower obesity, but in the current study of more than 12,000 Ohio residents, eating at home, rather than out, and without the television on, was tied to lower obesity risk regardless of how often family was present.   It may be difficult for some families to eat a meal together every day, but they may be able to have healthier habits for the meals they do share, researchers conclude in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.   “Families’ mealtime practices vary, and may be associated with adults’ obesity,” said lead author Rachel Tumin, of the Ohio Colleges of Medicine Government Resource Center in Columbus.   “Adults might eat more food when they are watching TV, and meals that are not home-cooked may be less healthy than meals that are home-cooked,” Tumin said by email.   To determine how family meal practices affect obesity risk, the study team analyzed data from the 2012 Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey on for 12,842 adults who had eaten at least one family meal in the past week.   The participants answered questions about how often they ate meals at home with their family, how often they watched TV while eating and how many of their meals were home-cooked.   The researchers used self-reported height and weight data to calculate each participant’s body mass index (BMI), a ratio of weight to height. People with a BMI over 30 were considered obese, and one third of participants fell into this category.   Overall, 52 percent of respondents ate family meals six or seven days per week, 35 percent ate family meals about every other day and 13 percent ate meals with family one or two days a week.    About a third of adults watched TV during most or all family meals, while another 36 percent did not watch any TV or videos during meals. For 62 percent of adults, all of the family meals they ate were cooked at home.   Researchers found that the number of meals people ate with their family was not linked to their likelihood of being obese.   Adults who cooked all of their family meals at home, however, were 26 percent less likely to be obese, compared with those who ate some or no home-cooked meals.    People who never watched TV during meals had 37 percent lower odds of being obese than those who always watched TV or videos during family meals.    While eating more family meals may be beneficial for health, the quality of meals is important as well, said Jerica Berge, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis who studies family meal practices.   “It’s not just eating more of them that matters, it is important to consider other factors such as the healthfulness of the food eaten at the meal, the emotional atmosphere at the meal, or whether there are distractions at the meal (e.g., TV),” Berge, who was not involved in the study, said by email.   “Turn off the TV when having family meals and use it as a time to check in about the day, current events, and fun future plans,” Berge said.   Tumin also advised leaving the TV off during meals, adding, “People who may not have time to cook their own meals could still consider buying healthy foods for family meals.”  "
2lAhd2D,2017-03-01,Emergency doc training important to improving transgender care," (Reuters Health) - The negative experiences of transgender and gender nonconforming patients in U.S. emergency departments could be avoided with better training for doctors, suggests a new study.   Based on survey responses from 240 transgender and gender nonconforming people, researchers say negative experiences were often attributable to doctors’ lack of knowledge.   “The biggest recommendation that came out from what we saw and what participants actually said was training,” said Dr. Makini Chisolm-Straker, the study’s lead author from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Training of medical staff “should be systematic and it should be required.”   People who are transgender or gender nonconforming identify as a gender different from the sex assigned at birth, or do not identify their gender as explicitly male or female.   “Basically, I wanted to find out from trans folks across the U.S. what their experience was in emergency departments,” Chisolm-Straker told Reuters Health.   For the new study, researchers surveyed transgender and gender nonconforming adults who visited U.S. emergency departments between 2012 and 2014. Participants were recruited from health centers serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities, Facebook, a national conference and word of mouth.   Two themes that emerged from the surveys were self-efficacy, which focused on the person’s need to speak up for themselves, and power inequity, which dealt with the dynamic between patient and provider.   Regarding self-efficacy, the researchers found, people who had others advocate on their behalf - such as a primary care doctor or family member - felt respected. People who had to advocate for themselves didn’t have positive experiences and some didn’t feel like they could speak up.   As for power inequity, the survey responses revealed, doctors were often unprepared to account for their patients’ needs as related to their gender identity.   One respondent recalled a junior doctor saying, “I don’t understand your body. I will just consider you female, but who knows what those hormones you are taking could be doing to you.”   Patients shouldn’t need to teach their doctors about transgender or gender nonconforming healthcare, but they often do, said Chisolm-Straker.   “When patients had to teach their clinicians about medicine, there was a bad dynamic,” she said. “It became clear the clinicians were uncomfortable.”   Respondents also recalled healthcare providers using the wrong names or pronouns. Some people also felt like they were being put on display or that their gender identity was unnecessarily the focus of conversation.   The respondents offered some suggestions for doctors.   About 45 percent suggested that providers should ask patients for their pronoun and name to use throughout care. About 36 percent suggested not asking about gender identity unless it’s relevant to care. About 23 percent suggested not discussing a patient’s gender identity and related health histories with anyone unless it’s relevant to care.   Chisolm-Straker said eliminating these issues will take a multi-level approach from the top to the bottom. For example, she said, it requires people to do research and support from those who oversee health systems.   Another important tool is for accrediting bodies to require a certain level of training, as they do for intimate-partner violence, she said.    “I don’t think it will go away in my lifetime, but I hope it will be a lot less of an issue,” said Chisolm-Straker.

2lsKXgQ,2017-03-01,Mild electric shocks on the arm might help ease migraine pain," (Reuters Health) - When a migraine strikes, patients might one day be able to make the experience less painful by using a smartphone-controlled device to deliver mild electric shocks to their arm, a company-funded experiment suggests.    The experimental gadget, Nerivio Migra, is a patch with a battery, electrodes and a computer chip that can wirelessly communicate with mobile devices. It’s designed to stimulate nerves under the skin in the arm and block pain signals from reaching the brain.    “All stimulation treatments given so far have been in the head,” said lead study author Dr. David Yarnitsky, an advisory board member for Theranica, the company developing the device.    “We worked on stimulation at a far away location, which makes the treatment more convenient and more discrete so people can use it even during working hours without anyone noticing,” Yarnitsky added by email.    The study involved 71 people with episodic migraines who had two to eight attacks a month and had not taken drugs to prevent the episodes for at least two months.    Participants were typically in their mid-to-late 40s and had been experiencing about five migraines a month. Most of them were female, and more than half of them reported experiencing what’s known as aura   Overall, participants had a total of 299 migraines during the study period.    Researchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. They were also asked not to take any medicines for migraines for two hours after the start of the episode.    For the experiment, researchers randomly programed the devices to give either placebo stimulation at a very low frequency or deliver one of four levels of active electrical stimulation treatment.    The four active treatment programs were set at a pulse rate of 80 to 120 Hertz (Hz) with pulse widths of 200, 150, 100 and 50. People feel less stimulation at lower pulse widths. At higher pulse widths than this device used, people might feel their muscles contract.    When researchers excluded the lowest pulse width, they found 64 percent of people in the other active treatment groups had at least a 50 percent pain reduction two hours after treatment, compared with 26 percent of people in the placebo group.    At the highest level of stimulation, 58 percent of the people who started out with moderate to severe pain reported little or no pain after treatment. So did 24 percent of people in the placebo group.    The timing of treatment also mattered.    People who started using the device within 20 minutes of the start of a migraine reported average pain reductions of 47 percent, compared to a 25 percent reduction in pain for people starting the device later.   Even though the study’s participants were not told whether they were assigned active or placebo treatment, one limitation of the experiment is that participants often stopped placebo treatments before the recommended 20-minute course of stimulation was done, the authors note in Neurology.    The technology known as transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) that was tested in the current study has been examined in other devices for migraine pain for decades, said Dr. Jean Schoenen, a neurology researcher at the University of Liege in Belgium who wasn’t involved in the current experiment.    One shortcoming of the current study is that researchers didn’t examine how long the pain relief lasts beyond two hours, Schoenen said by email.     “Rapid and sustained relief is what patients want,” Schoenen added.    If the device works in larger trials and becomes widely available for migraine patients, it might offer an alternative for people who can’t tolerate migraine drugs or an option patients could try in addition to medication when they don’t get enough pain relief from drugs alone, Schoenen said.    “The percentage of attacks for which TENS is sufficient as sole treatment and allows sustained pain relief remains to be determined,” Schoenen cautioned.   "
2ldct2A,2017-02-28,Obese couples may take longer to conceive," (Reuters Health) - - Couples who are obese may take longer to achieve pregnancy than partners who aren’t as overweight, a recent U.S. study suggests.                     The legs of women are pictured as they walk along a street in Paris, France, October 14, 2015. REUTERS/Jacky Naegelen      Previous studies in women have linked obesity to difficulties getting pregnant. In the current study, neither male nor female obesity alone was linked to taking a longer time to conceive, but when both partners were obese, the couple took up to 59 percent longer to conceive than non-obese counterparts.   “If our results are confirmed, fertility specialists may want to take couples’ weight status into account when counseling them about achieving pregnancy,” said lead study author Rajeshwari Sundaram of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland.   “The benefits of a healthy weight are well known: obesity increases the risk for diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer,” Sundaram added by email.   Sundaram and colleagues focused on the relationship between pregnancy and body mass index (BMI), a ratio of weight to height. A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered a healthy weight, while 25 to 29.9 is overweight, 30 or above is obese and 40 or higher is what's known as morbidly obese. (The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has an online BMI calculator here:  bit.ly/1D0ZqDv. )   An adult who is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 160 pounds, for example, would have a BMI of 23.6, which is in the healthy range. An obese adult at that height would weigh at least 203 pounds and have a BMI of 30 or more.   Researchers categorized individuals into two subgroups: obese class I, with a BMI from 30 to 34.9, and obese class II, with a BMI of 35 or greater.   Overall, 27 percent of the women and 41 percent of the men were obese class I or heavier.    Then, the researchers compared the average time to conceive for couples where neither partner was obese to couples where both fell into the obese class II group.   Couples in the obese class II group took 55 percent longer to achieve pregnancy than their normal weight counterparts, the study team calculated.   After accounting for other factors that influence fertility such as age, smoking status, exercise and cholesterol levels, obese class II couples took 59 percent longer to get pregnant.    About 40 percent of the men and 47 percent of the women also had enough excess fat around the midsection to potentially influence fertility.    In addition, 60 percent of the women and 58 percent of the men said they exercised no more than once a week, the researchers report in Human Reproduction.    Beyond its small size, another limitation of the study is that it wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to determine whether obesity directly causes infertility, the authors note. It also focused on couples in the general population, not people undergoing treatment for infertility, so the results might not reflect what would happen for all couples trying to conceive, the researchers point out.    However, unlike many other studies of obesity and fertility, the current analysis used height and weight measured by clinicians instead of relying on participants to report this information themselves, which may make the findings more accurate.    Obesity can influence fertility by altering hormone levels in both men and women, converting testosterone to estrogen, said Dr. Jeffrey Goldberg, section head of reproductive endocrinology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.    “If you have more fat there is more conversion from testosterone to estrogen,” Goldberg, who wasn’t involved in the study, said.    It makes sense that obese couples would take longer to conceive because excess weight doesn’t just impact fertility in women.    “For women extra weight impairs ovulatory function,” Goldberg said. “For guys, having lower testosterone and higher estrogen impairs sperm production and having a lot of fat around the scrotum, fat thighs and fat around the abdomen raises the scrotal temperature and that can also have an adverse effect.”  "
2m3SLtK,2017-02-28,Few people know about overlapping surgery," (Reuters Health) - Most people aren’t aware that surgeons are sometimes involved in multiple operations happening at the same time, and many patients might object to the practice if they knew about it, a recent U.S. study suggests.    Researchers focused on what’s known as overlapping surgery, when a senior surgeon performs critical components of one operation at the same that a trainee surgeon or physician assistant handles a non-critical portion of another procedure. For example, it might mean the assistant closes up an incision on one patient while a senior surgeon begins an operation on another patient.    Only about 4 percent of the 1,454 people surveyed for the study had heard of overlapping surgery, the study found. Just 31 percent of them strongly supported the practice once it was explained, and nearly all of the participants thought patients should be told before surgery exactly what aspects of their operations might be handled by a senior surgeon or by a trainee, or resident, surgeon or an assistant.    “Surgeons should discuss overlapping surgery with patients beforehand and obtain their consent if this is part of their practice,” said lead study author Dr. Michael Kent of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School in Boston.    Generally, people understand the pros and cons of the practice once they know what it is, Kent added by email.    “Respondents understood that overlapping surgery allows surgeons to potentially perform more operations in a given day, so patients may not need to wait as long for their procedure,” Kent said. “They also understand that complications may occur when a surgeon’s attention is divided, and this may have an impact on patient safety.”   For the study, Kent and colleagues surveyed participants about their knowledge of overlapping surgery, their expectations regarding disclosure during the informed consent process and their willingness to have this type of surgery as a patient.    Half of the participants were at least 33 years old, and they ranged in age from 21 to 74.    During the survey, researchers randomly selected one of three scenarios to illustrate what happens during overlapping surgery: a hip replacement, a procedure to remove a brain tumor or a heart valve replacement. All three scenarios offered similar descriptions of the roles filled by senior surgeons and assistants.   Overall, about 92 percent of respondents thought surgeons should document what portion of the operations they were present for, researchers report in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons.    When asked specifically about assistants or trainees, 86 percent of participants thought patients should be told prior to surgery who would be in the operating room and 84 percent thought the precise role of trainees should be disclosed.    After overlapping surgery was described, about 70 percent of participants thought the practice might be acceptable in certain circumstances, such as lower-risk procedures or in situations when an emergency occurred in another operating room.    The survey was done using Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowd-sourcing worksite, and it’s possible the participants’ responses might not reflect a broad cross section of the general public, the authors note.    Also, the study focused on the more accepted practice of overlapping surgery, not situations, known as concurrent surgery, when one senior surgeon is in charge of crucial portions of two different operations at the same time.    Concurrent surgery, is rare and generally should be avoided unless there’s an urgent or unplanned situation, said Dr. Karl Bilimoria, director of the Surgical Outcomes and Quality Improvement Center at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.   Overlapping surgeries, like the kind examined in the study, are more common and relatively safe, Bilimoria, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.   “The resident or physician assistant given this responsibility is well trained and competent to take on that task without the surgeon physically present,” Bilimoria added. “In many cases, the resident or physician assistant has done this hundreds or thousands of times.”  "
2kGa0NR,2017-02-28,Breast cancer costs low-income women more jobs," (Reuters Health) - Poor women undergoing breast cancer treatment are four times more likely to lose their jobs than their high-income peers, a new study suggests.    The findings were consistent with stories Molly MacDonald hears at the Pink Fund, a Rochester Hills, Michigan, nonprofit she started to offer financial help to women with breast cancer in 2006, after treatment for the disease left her jobless and bankrupt.   “While fighting for their lives, many patients lose their livelihoods,” MacDonald said in a phone interview.   The loss disproportionately strikes poor women, probably because low-wage hourly workers tend to be more easily replaceable, and their employers are less likely to accommodate their needs as they go through time-consuming and draining treatment, MacDonald said.   Dr. Victoria Blinder, a breast cancer oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, led a team of researchers who analyzed the job status of 267 racially and ethnically diverse women treated for invasive breast cancer between 2010 and 2016.    Income and employers’ willingness to make workplace accommodations were the driving factors in whether women retained their jobs four months after finishing breast cancer treatment, the researchers found.   Low-income women were only half as likely as higher-income women to have accommodating employers and only one-fourth as likely to keep their jobs, according to the results in Health Affairs.   “We showed that if they’re able to obtain work accommodations, they’re more likely to retain their jobs,” Blinder said in a phone interview. “The key is to try to help women so they advocate for themselves and optimize their chances of staying on a job they want to keep.”   Patients have told her that when they’re not working, they’re often in bed thinking about cancer.   “The psychological impact of going through a diagnosis and these treatments can be profound. Work for a lot of people is a way to escape that and to feel like they are in control,” she said.   Race and ethnicity had little impact on whether women kept their jobs, the study found, although Chinese participants were less likely to continue working than white women, a statistic diluted by the small number of women in both categories.   “The value of the paper is there does not seem to be much ethnic or racial bias here,” said Dr. Patricia Ganz, professor at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health in Los Angeles.    “The more important thing is the kind of employment. If you’re low income, your employer is more likely going to be inflexible about keeping your spot,” she said in a phone interview.   “It’s a social and equity issue,” she said.   Ganz and Blinder both said they frequently write letters to employers on behalf of patients who need help advocating for themselves. In some cases, the fix is as simple as providing more breaks or allowing time off for treatment.   In other cases, MacDonald said, saving a job could be impossible, if, for example, a bus driver who underwent a mastectomy feels pain every time she shifts gears while driving.   Blinder is working on developing a mobile health app that would coach women on negotiation strategies for accommodations.   Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, government employers and private employers with 15 or more employees must make “reasonable accommodations” for workers diagnosed with cancer.    Nearly one in eight American women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime, the authors write.    A 2016 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that people who underwent cancer treatment and filed for bankruptcy protection were more likely to die than those who remained financially healthy.    A previous Health Affairs report found that one-third of working-age cancer survivors go into debt, and 3 percent file for bankruptcy.   "
2m4efGR,2017-02-28,"For nursing home residents, activities associated with thriving"," (Reuters Health) - Nursing home residents who have a range of activity options may be more likely to thrive than their peers who don’t have as many choices of things to do, a Swedish study suggests.    “The key issue to support resident thriving seems to be that residents have a selection and variety in activities, and that the activities are meaningful to the residents,” said study author Sabine Bjork of the University of Umea.    “If I was the daughter or spouse of a nursing home resident, I would be more interested in to what extent the care was person-centered and how staff work together with residents to facilitate social engagement and activities despite their physical and/or cognitive impairments,” Bjork added by email, “rather than the prevalence rate of physical activities in the nursing home.”   For the study, Bjork and colleagues surveyed staff from 172 Swedish nursing homes with a total of 4,831 residents. They asked caregivers to assess individual residents’ cognitive and functional abilities, engagement in activities and what’s known as thriving - or quality of life and wellbeing.    Residents in the study were 86 years old on average, though they ranged from 47 to 107. Roughly two-thirds were female.    The most common everyday activities included receiving hugs and physical touch, talking to friends and relatives, talking to staff about issues unrelated to care and personal grooming, researchers report in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.    Some of the least common daily activities included going to the movies, participating in educational programs, visiting restaurants, doing everyday chores and playing games with others.    While gender, age and physical and mental health explained some of the variation in thriving among residents, some of the difference could also be associated with what residents did during the day, the study found.    Roughly 25 percent of the variation in thriving among residents could be explained by opportunities to engage in an activity program, dress nicely, spend time with someone the resident likes, engage in a hobby, participate in religious activities, have conversations with staff about topics unrelated to care, watch television, get exercise, go outside, play games, participate in celebrations and receive hugs or physical touch.    Out of all these things, engagement in activity programs appeared to have the biggest influence on thriving, followed by dressing well and spending time with someone the resident liked.    The study wasn’t designed to prove how the availability of certain activities might influence thriving among nursing home residents.   Other limitations include the possibility that residents with greater functionality and better quality of life or wellbeing were able to participate in a wider variety of activities, the authors note. This means thriving might make more activities possible, rather than activities causing people to thrive.    Even so, the findings add to a body of research suggesting that physical and social activities can lead to improved health outcomes for nursing home residents, said Dr. XinQi Dong, associate director of the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.   “Physical and social activities can be a conduit for nursing home residents to have a daily purpose to look forward to, potentially reducing a sense of psychological distress, which can lead to improved subjective wellbeing in their daily lives,” Dong, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    When patients and families are choosing a nursing home, they should look at staffing levels and also ask how staff help residents engage in activities, Dong added. This may not be one-size-fits-all because residents can have a variety of health issues like dementia, physical disabilities, mental illness or an inability to manage self-care.   Ideally, families should look for nursing homes that track what activities residents join and what they enjoy, Bjork said.    “I would choose a nursing home that rigorously and systematically collects this type of information on their residents and actually incorporates this in the care,” Bjork added.   "
2m4gIBn,2017-02-27,Most U.S. high schools lack athletic trainers," (Reuters Health) - Many U.S. high schools don’t offer athletic training services and few employ full-time athletic trainers, according to a new study.   Private institutions were even less likely than public schools to provide athletic training services or employ trainers, researchers found.   “Athletic trainers really provide the knowledge, security, expertise and education to keep athletes on the field and off the sidelines,” said lead author Alicia Pike, of the Korey Stringer Institute at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. “The students can really focus on the benefits, and enjoyment of safe and fair play.”   The researchers write in the Journal of Athletic Training that the number of student athletes rose for the 25th consecutive year from 2013 to 2014. At that time, nearly 8 million students were athletes.   The American Medical Association and the National Athletic Trainers’ Association endorse the hiring of full-time and on-site athletic trainers, they add. Research suggest schools that follow that guidance have lower injury rates than those without athletic trainers.   Athletic trainers work with physicians to provide a range of healthcare services to student athletes ranging from minor bruises to sudden cardiac arrest.   For the new study, Pike and colleagues surveyed 8,509 public and 2,044 private U.S. high schools between 2011 and 2014.   Overall, 70 percent of public schools and 58 percent of private schools offered some level of athletic training services.   Only 37 percent of public schools offered full-time athletic training services, compared to only 28 percent of private schools.   Schools cited a number of barriers to hiring athletic trainers, Pike said, including budget issues, school size, lack of awareness about the role of athletic trainers and other school characteristics like rural environments.   The researchers suggest that ways to overcome these barriers should be explored.   Athletic trainers are a “vital aspect for the health and safety of the student athlete,” Pike said.  "
2kV2Rxo,2017-02-24,&#039;Fasting-mimicking&#039; diet said to reduce risk factors for aging,"  (This version of the story corrects Dr. Valter Longo’s affiliation in paragraph five and link in source line.)   (Reuters Health) - Following a diet that mimics fasting may reduce risk factors for disease in generally healthy people, according to a small study.   Dr. Min Wei of USC’s Longevity Institute and colleagues tested the effects of the fasting-mimicking diet on various risk factors for diabetes, heart disease, cancer or other conditions.   The diet (FMD; brand name ProLon) is low in calories, sugars and protein but high in unsaturated fats. Forty-eight study participants ate normally for three months while 52 ate FMD for five days each month and ate normally the rest of the time. After three months, the groups switched regimens. Although all participants were considered healthy, some had high blood pressure, low levels of “good” cholesterol, and other risk factors.    A total of 71 people completed the study, which was published in Science Translational Medicine. Body mass index, blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol improved with FMD, but mainly for those who were already at risk. Side effects were mild, including fatigue, weakness and headaches.   Wei and Dr. Valter Longo, who is also affiliated with the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, said in an interview published in the journal that while “the great majority” of participants had one or more risk factors for diseases such as diabetes, heart disease or cancer, “FDA trials will be necessary to demonstrate whether periodic FMD is effective in disease prevention and treatment.”   Dr. Joseph Antoun, CEO of L-Nutra, Inc., which produces FMD, told Reuters Health by email that FMD “is intended for use by individuals who want to optimize their health and wellbeing, by overweight or obese individuals who want to manage their weight in an easy and healthy way, and by people who have abnormal levels of biomarkers for aging and age-related conditions.”   That said, Antoun acknowledged that if you have common conditions associated with overweight and obesity such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer, you should not use FMD without a doctor’s approval.    The product also should not be used by children under 18 or pregnant or nursing women. And it’s not for you if you have certain metabolic diseases, liver or kidney disorders that may be affected by the very low glucose and protein content of the diet, or if you have nut or soy allergies. What’s more, it “should never be combined with glucose-lowering drugs, such as metformin or insulin,” according to Antoun.   Registered dietitian Ashlea Braun of the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus pointed out that researchers compared the fasting-mimicking diet to participants’ usual diet. “Therefore, we don’t yet know how this diet stands up against long-standing approaches already shown to be beneficial, such as the Mediterranean or DASH Diet.”   “It’s not clear if (FMD) enables individuals to consistently meet all micronutrient requirements,” she told Reuters Health by email. “It’s also not known how this type of restrictive diet affects muscle mass in the long term, and what impact this has on various indicators of health.”   “Although there is some evidence showing these type of restrictive diets can help ‘jump start’ people considering lifestyle changes, more research is definitely needed before this is recommended for individuals,” Braun concluded.

2liHp1y,2017-02-24,Not all bug repellents are equal," (Reuters Health) - Pay attention to the ingredients of bug sprays and other repellents, because they’re not equally effective at warding off mosquitoes that carry diseases like Zika virus, researchers say.   Products with DEET or oil of lemon eucalyptus, which contains an ingredient known as PMD, are more effective at repelling the Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever and dengue, researchers found.    Wearable devices advertised as mosquito repellents should largely be avoided, their data suggest.   With the recent outbreak of Zika virus, many mosquito repellents became best-selling products, said Immo Hansen, of New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, the senior member of the research team.   “They’re very popular,” Hansen told Reuters Health, citing the number of products for sale just on Amazon.com.   For the new study, researchers purchased and tested 11 products from Amazon.com and local stores in New Mexico. Altogether they tested five wearable devices, five sprays and one candle, using human volunteers who hadn’t bathed or used deodorant for at least 15 hours before the experiments.   The tests were conducted in wind tunnels. Fifteen minutes after releasing the mosquitoes, the research team counted how many bugs had come close to the participant, to determine how many were attracted to the person’s smell.   Without any type of device or spray in the tunnel, about 89 to 91 percent of the mosquitoes were attracted to the volunteers, depending on how far away they sat from where the insects were released.   Of the five wearable devices, only one - the OFF! Clip-on - significantly reduced the number of mosquitoes drawn to the participants’ scents. The attraction rate was only about 27 percent when people were one meter from the cage. The device uses a fan to disperse an insect-repelling chemical known as metofluthrin.   The other wearable devices included a speaker to repel mosquitoes and three bracelets that emitted different oils.   “None of the bracelets had any effect on reducing attraction,” said lead author Stacy Rodriguez, who is also affiliated with New Mexico State University.   All of the spray-on repellents significantly reduced the number of mosquitoes attracted to the participants, with attraction rates varying from about 30 percent (with Cutter Lemon Eucalyptus and Ben’s Tick & Insect Repellent) to about 79 percent. The tested spray-ons generally used DEET or oils like lemon eucalyptus.   Like many of the wearable devices, the candle that contained citronella oil did not significantly reduce the number of mosquitoes attracted to participants’ scents.   The products’ popularity and their ineffectiveness suggests there are not enough regulations in place to protect consumers, said Hansen.   The researchers write in the Journal of Insect Science that consumers may feel a false sense of comfort that they are protected by these devices when they actually are not.   “I think (it’s) definitely important to look at the active ingredients before you purchase something,” said Rodriguez.   The researchers caution that additional studies are needed since they only used female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.  "
2lBF1Wv,2017-02-24,Painkillers often stored within reach of little kids," (Reuters Health) - Opioid pain relievers such as codeine and hydrocodone often aren’t stored safely in households with children, according to a new study.   About one in three parents with children under age 7 reported storing their opioid prescription by locking it up, and about one in 11 parents with children between ages 7 and 17 remembered storing their medicines properly.   “Parents know their children best and often think having medicine under lock and key isn’t necessary, especially as kids get older, but we’ve seen hospitalizations double since the 1990s,” said lead study author Eileen McDonald of the Johns Hopkins Center for Injury Research and Policy in Baltimore, Maryland.   “We want to think the best about our kids, especially when it comes to alcohol and drug avoidance, but most start using from family and friends,” she told Reuters Health. “Given the pervasiveness of opioids at home, parents need to have safe storage or remove them completely when not being used.”   McDonald and colleagues surveyed 681 adults who used opioid pain relievers in the past year and had children under age 18 at home. For those with young children under age 7, about 33 percent said they locked up their medicine, and 12 percent of those with older children put their medicines in a locked area. In families with both age groups, about 29 percent of parents used lockable storage.    The research team also asked about parents’ beliefs and actions regarding opioids in the home. Parents with younger children were more likely to worry about their kids and say that children can overdose on opioids. Parents with older children were half as likely to report safe storage as barriers increased, saying that storing medicine in a locked place takes too much time or makes it too hard to take the medicine.   “We were most surprised to see that more than half of the parents had heard about a child who died from getting into their parents’ opioids at home, but that didn’t change their behavior,” McDonald said.   Opioid use in the United States has soared in recent years. Almost 2 million Americans start new opioid pain relief prescriptions annually, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Overall, more than 250 million opioid prescriptions are filled each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   In many cases, the drugs are prescribed to help with pain after surgery.   High opioid use has been linked to abuse, heroin use and higher numbers of drug poisoning deaths, especially in children, the study authors wrote in Pediatrics. In fact, opioid-related hospitalizations for children have doubled from 1997 to 2012, according to a December 2016 study published in JAMA Pediatrics.    “The largest increase occurred in children ages 1 to 4, which is scary,” said Julie Gaither of the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. Gaither, who was not involved with this study, was lead author of the 2016 JAMA Pediatrics report.    “Children are our most vulnerable group, and it’s important to speak to parents and find out what they really know about opioids,” she told Reuters Health. “My sense is that they don’t really know what an opioid is or how to store it safely.”   Along with codeine and hydrocodone, opioids include oxycodone, methadone, hydromorphone, morphine and fentanyl.   When these drugs aren’t in use, poison control groups recommended safely disposing of them. Instead of flushing them down the sink or toilet, which can harm the water system, mix the medicines with unpalatable substances, such as coffee grounds or cat litter, and throw them away. Alternatively, search online for an officially approved disposal site, such as a local drugstore or police station.   “The opioid problem is complex, but for kids, it doesn’t have to be,” Gaither said. “The solution is simple - keep the drugs away from kids by keeping them out of the house.”  "
2m4ulg6,2017-02-22,Many pacemaker recipients can safely get non-chest MRIs," (Reuters Health) - It might be possible for people with an older pacemaker to safely get an MRI after all.   A new study suggests that avoiding a scan of the chest and reprogramming the pacemaker before and after the scan can prevent malfunction of cardiac pacemakers and implantable cardiac defibrillators.   The finding is good news for pacemaker and defibrillator patients because it makes it easier for their doctors to diagnose problems that can be difficult to detect without magnetic resonance imagining (MRI).   “If you need an MRI, if an MRI is the study of choice, there’s no reason you should not have access to it because we didn’t really find any evidence of harm to the patient,” lead author Dr. Robert Russo of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, told Reuters Health.    “This is very significant in terms of clinical practice because for years and years and years it’s always been that scanning pacemaker patients with MRI was contraindicated” unless they had a newer device specifically designed to be safe during the test, said Dr. Robert Watson, chairman of neuroradiology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.   But it’s also “absolutely imperative that people not misconstrue this study with the sound bite that MRI is safe in patients with pacemakers. You can still kill a patient with an MRI if you do it wrong,” said Watson, who was not involved in the study.   People with the implantable devices are often excluded from MRIs out of concern that the powerful magnetic fields emitted by the machines can overheat the lead wires implanted in the heart and interfere with the pacemaker’s sensitive electronics.   Newer devices are designed to reduce that risk, but about 2 million Americans and another 6 million people worldwide don’t carry such “MRI-conditional” implants. A 2005 analysis estimated that at least half of these people will need an MRI in their lifetimes.   The Russo team used a registry, developed in 2009, that logged cases of adults with a programmable defibrillator or pacemaker implanted after 2001 who got an MRI.   If the patient had an adequate heart rate of at least 40 beats per minute, the devices were turned off. If the rate was lower, the devices were set to blindly make the heart beat at a steady rate, eliminating the usual feedback the devices get to readjust their electrical pulses. After the MRI, the settings were restored.   At 19 U.S. centers, 818 patients with pacemakers and 500 with implantable defibrillators were evaluated, according to the report in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Three quarters of the MRIs were done on the brain or spine. The chest area was not imaged.   None of the MRI recipients died and only one needed to have their implanted device replaced due to a generator failure apparently caused by a failure to properly reprogram the implantable defibrillator before the MRI.    Six patients developed a temporary rhythm problem that corrected itself within two days. Another six needed to have their devices reset with non-critical data, such as patient identification information.   The team logged some voltage changes, but “all the changes we saw were relatively small and not clinically significant,” said Russo.   In addition, the number of MRIs that patients received did not seem to affect the risk.    “One patient had a total of 11 MRIs of the brain performed because of a history of primary cancer of the brain,” he said.   That case showed why MRIs are important for pacemaker patients because, after chemotherapy, radiation and surgical treatment, “CT scanning suggested there was no recurrence. But MRI showed there was residual tumor and more treatment was necessary,” he said.   Patients need to tell medical personnel if they have an implantable device, Watson stressed. But with MRI available to them, and the proper protocols to avoid or deal with any unexpected device malfunctions, “you can make life-changing diagnoses.”   Whether chest MRIs are just as safe remains an open question. Russo said he suspects that they are.   Watson said the Mayo Clinic, using a multidisciplinary team, has “done a fair number of cardiac MRIs and have not experienced an adverse patient outcome.”  "
2lctQla,2017-02-23,Does penis length recover after prostate removal?,"  (This version of the story corrects measurements cited in paragraph seven)   By Andrew  M. Seaman   (Reuters Health) - After prostate removal for cancer, men sometimes complain to their doctors that their penis shrank, but a new study from Japan suggests they should not lose hope.   Following men for up to two years after surgery, researchers found the patients’ penises were shortest a few days after their procedures. Penis lengths generally returned to normal after one year, however.   The study’s lead author said the research was started after encountering a few patients complaining of penis shortening after prostate removal, which is known medically as a radical prostatectomy.    Past reports mentioned shortened penises after prostate removal, but the results were a bit different, said Dr. Yoshifumi Kadono, of Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medicine Science.   “Therefore, we started our study to obtain our data,” he told Reuters Health.   For the new study, the researchers measured the penis lengths of 102 men before having their prostates removed and then at 10 days after surgery and again one, three, six, nine, 12, 18 and 24 months later.   The men’s stretched penis lengths were shortest 10 days after surgery, when measurements were an average of about 1.99 centimeters (0.78 inches) shorter than before prostate removal.   By the one-year mark, the men’s penises generally returned to original lengths, which averaged about 11.72 centimeters (4.61 inches), according to the results in BJU International.       The researchers wanted to know what caused the shortening and if any particular variable, such as the size of a man’s prostate gland, would predict which men would experience this effect.   Based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)of the patients, the researchers noticed some internal changes. Specifically, the portion of the urethra directly below the bladder moves up into the body after surgery, but moves back down after some time.   “However, further research is needed to elucidate long-term changes of (penis length) with respect to the influence of sex hormones or changes in penile blood flow after (radical prostatectomy),” said Kadono.   The new findings may be useful for men who have low-to-moderate self esteem tied to their perceived lost penis length after their surgery, he added.   The findings may not represent reality for all men, however.   Most men will have some penis length loss after surgery and sometimes that will be permanent, said Dr. John Mulhall, who is director of the Male Sexual and Reproductive Medicine Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.   “If you have documental length loss at six months, then you shouldn’t expect that to improve at 12 months,” said Mulhall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.   He told Reuters Health that loss of penis length can be attributed to two issues. For example, muscle contractions may pull the penis into the body, but that relaxes over time. Men may also experience after surgery the loss of erection tissue.   “Once that muscle degenerates, it’s gone,” he told Reuters Health.   Dr. Drogo Montague, who wasn’t involved in the new study but often treats urological issues in men after prostate removal, also said some penises may appear shorter after surgery due to scar tissue that builds up when men have sex with partial erections.       The patients included in the new study would generally be considered to be normal weight, noted Montague, who is a professor of surgery at the Center for Genitourinary Reconstruction Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.   “So these findings won’t necessary be generalizable because of the prevalence of obesity,” he told Reuters Health.   Mulhall said medications like Viagra and Cialis - known as PDE5 inhibitors -are shown in previous research to guard against lost penile length after prostate removal.   In addition to PDE5 inhibitor, Montague said men can get prostheses and other interventions to strengthen their penises.  "
2m5zXep,2017-02-22,Licorice during pregnancy linked to health issues for kids," (Reuters Health) - Women who consume licorice during pregnancy might be more likely to have children with cognitive or behavioral problems than mothers who don’t eat a lot of this candy while they’re pregnant, a small Finnish study suggests.   Some previous lab experiments have linked glycyrrhizin, a natural sweetener in licorice root, to changes in the placenta that may make it easier for the stress hormone cortisol to travel from mothers to their developing babies, said lead study author Katri Raikkonen of the University of Helsinki. Some cortisol aids fetal development, but too much may alter neurodevelopmental processes and contribute to cognitive or behavior issues later in life, Raikkonen said by email.   For the current study, researchers examined data on 378 children born in Helsinki in 1998 and their mothers, quizzing the women on licorice consumption after they gave birth and then assessing children for developmental issues when they were about 13 years old.    Girls and boys born to mothers who ate a lot of licorice during pregnancy - which researchers defined as an amount containing at least 500 milligrams (0.02 ounces) of glycyrrhizin a week - scored lower on intelligence tests, had poorer memory and higher odds of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder than children whose mothers consumed little or no licorice during pregnancy, the study found.    Girls also appeared to start puberty sooner when mothers ate a lot of licorice during pregnancy.    “Our findings therefore suggest that it would be sensible to avoid licorice and other food products that contain glycyrrhizin during the 40 weeks of pregnancy,” Raikkonen said.   Because licorice extracts are used extensively as sweeteners in food, drinks and some herbal products, one 2006 study estimated average glycyrrhizin consumption in the U.S. at anywhere from 1.85 mg to 205 mg per day for a 150-pound person.     In the current study, 327 of the children were exposed to no licorice at all in utero or no more than 249 milligrams of glycyrrhizin a week, researchers report in the American Journal of Epidemiology. Mothers of these kids consumed 47 mg of glycyrrhizin a week on average while they were pregnant.    Another 51 kids had mothers who consumed at least 500 mg of glycyrrhizin a week during pregnancy, or about 845 mg a week on average.    When compared to the children exposed to little or no licorice in utero, kids exposed to a lot of licorice scored more than 7 age-standardized points lower for estimated general, verbal and performance IQ and also did worse on tests measuring verbal productivity and memory.    Kids with high glycyrrhizin exposure also had more than three-fold higher odds of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, the study found.    Girls with higher glycyrrhizin exposure in the womb appeared to weigh more and start breast development sooner than girls whose mothers consumed little or no licorice.    Beyond its small size, another limitation of the study is that it’s not a controlled experiment designed to prove that licorice consumption during pregnancy directly causes developmental problems in children, researchers note. They also lacked data on the amount of glycyrrhizin in any licorice women ate during pregnancy or other food or drink they might have consumed with glycyrrhizin in it.    Not all licorice contains a lot of glycyrrhizin, Katherine Keyes, a public health researcher at Columbia University Medical Center in New York said in a phone interview.    “If you are going to avoid something in pregnancy, there is much more evidence for avoiding alcohol or smoking,” said Keyes, who wasn’t involved in the study. “With licorice consumption the science is still not clear.”   “Women are bombarded during pregnancy with so many things they can’t do and not listen because it’s too much,” Keyes added. “Focusing on alcohol and tobacco is the most important, and focusing on other things like licorice is less important.”   "
2kN9bXZ,2017-02-22,Many U.S. cancer patients struggle to afford life-saving medications," (Reuters Health) - As cancer drug costs rise, U.S. cancer patients are more likely than other medical patients to struggle with paying for prescription medications, according to a recent study.   The financial burdens are especially high for patients under age 65 who cannot access Medicare, the government insurance program for the elderly, and for people with multiple medical conditions, researchers say.   The prices of cancer-treating drugs are on the rise and a newer cancer medication can cost over $100,000 per year for each patient, the study team writes in the journal Cancer. In addition, higher insurance deductibles and copayments can mean that patients are paying more out of pocket for medications.   “Financial toxicity is now a well established and generally accepted toxicity related to cancer care,” writes Dr. Daniel Goldstein, an oncologist at Rabin Medical Center in Israel, in an accompanying editorial.   Doctors may not be aware how much cancer drugs cost for each patient and the topic of cost may not come up unless the patient introduces it, study author Amy Davidoff, a senior research scientist at Yale School of Public Health, told Reuters Health.   “In some cases, there may be a lower-cost alternative, but it may be somewhat less effective, have greater risk of side effects, or be less convenient to take,” Davidoff said by email. At other times, she added, differences may be very small and switching may not have a consequence.   The research team analyzed data from annual U.S. national health surveys in 2011 through 2014 to compare how likely cancer patients and non-cancer patients were to make changes to their prescription medications for financial reasons.   The researchers compared the responses of 9,000 people with a history of cancer and more than 93,000 patients with no cancer history. They also looked at how recently cancer patients were diagnosed, whether they had any other medical conditions, the type of insurance participants had and the deductible amounts they had to pay before insurance covered their drug costs.    The study team found that 32 percent of the patients recently diagnosed with cancer and 28 percent of people with any past history of cancer reported a change in their prescription drug use due to financial concerns. Among people with no history of cancer, 21 percent changed their medications because of money considerations.   The patients most likely to ask their doctors for lower-cost medication were cancer survivors under age 65 who had high-deductible insurance plans.   The more medical conditions people were dealing with, the more likely they were also to ask to switch to lower-cost medications.   “The cost of cancer care is very high - there are many diagnostic tests as well as drug, radiation and surgical therapies that cost a lot of money,” Goldstein, who was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health by email.   “There may also be significant time lost from work, many clinic appointments that may lead to high costs related to copays and deductibles,” he said.   For patients who choose to switch to lower-cost medications, the effects vary widely from no effect to potential death, Goldstein noted.   “Both patients and physicians should feel comfortable to discuss both the cost and efficacy of their medical care,” said Goldstein. “Physicians need to be honest with patients about the potential clinical benefit of the drugs that they are receiving, particularly when there is a high financial burden.”   “If the cost of drugs prescribed by your physician creates a barrier to taking them, or will result in major financial burdens, it is important to speak with your physician,” Davidoff said.    “In many cases it may be possible to try a lower cost alternative first to see if it works. Otherwise, physicians or their support staff may be able to assist the patient in finding help to pay for expensive medications,” she said.  "
2lT1pvE,2017-02-21,"Men more at risk of cognitive impairment, death after hip fracture"," (Reuters Health) - After a hip fracture, men are more cognitively impaired - and therefore, more at risk of death - than women, researchers in Baltimore say.   By 2025, the number of hip fractures in men will be as high as what’s currently seen in women, the researchers warn.   That makes these fractures “an emerging public health concern for older men, their families, and the healthcare system,” according to Dr. Ann Gruber-Baldini of the University of Maryland School of Medicine and her colleagues. “Compared to women, men who fracture a hip have an increased risk of mortality . . . despite their younger age at the time of fracture.”   As reported in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, the researchers compared the impact of a hip fracture on thinking skills and risk of death in 166 men and 168 women over age 80.    The men had significantly more other diseases to start with, and more of them had been diagnosed with dementia. Men also were significantly more impaired on most cognitive measures.    After taking any pre-fracture dementia and other risk factors into account, men were still at significantly higher risk for poor scores on a variety of tests of thinking skills.    Men also had higher mortality rates than women six months after hip fracture - and the men’s scores on cognitive tests were significantly associated with their risk of death: those who did poorly on the tests were more likely to die during the study.   On one common test - the modified Mini-Mental-State Exam - nearly a third of the men with poor scores died within six months, compared with 15 percent of women with poor scores and 11 percent of men with no cognitive problems. By contrast, only 2 percent of women without cognitive problems on this test died within six months.   No significant interaction effects were seen between gender and cognition.   Gruber-Baldini told Reuters Health, “It may be valuable for clinicians to monitor hip fracture patients after hospital discharge - especially men - to see if they are still experiencing cognitive impairment and effects of delirium.”   “Interventions to reduce delirium - evaluation of medications, nutrition, infections, and comorbidities - may be needed,” she said by email. “It is also important that those with cognitive impairment get rehabilitation to help improve their mobility.”   Orthopedic surgeon Dr. John Tiberi of the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in Los Angeles, California told Reuters Health, “Hip fractures in the elderly are known to have significant risks, even after appropriate treatment.”    “This study highlights the increasing incidence of hip fractures in men as well as the higher rates of some adverse outcomes in men compared to women,” he said by email. “Knowledge of these findings may better assist health care providers and family members in providing care and support for hip fracture patients during the incredibly important recovery and rehabilitation process.”  "
2lCxhDO,2017-02-22,Toddler behavioral symptoms may hint at celiac disease," (Reuters Health) – For small kids with a family history of celiac disease, anxiety, aggression, sleep problems and other behavioral issues might signal that it’s time to test for celiac, researchers say.   In the study of 3- and 4-year olds at high risk for celiac, mothers of 3-year-olds that had undiagnosed celiac reported more negative psychological symptoms in their children compared to mothers of toddlers with diagnosed celiac or of kids that didn’t have the disease.    “This is the first prospective study to be able to answer the question whether children with celiac disease autoimmunity have psychological manifestation symptoms,” senior study author Dr. Daniel Agardh of Malmo University in Sweden told Reuters Health by email.   Celiac disease is an autoimmune condition affecting the small intestine. It’s triggered by eating a protein called gluten, which is found in wheat, barley and rye. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as loose stools and abdominal discomfort are common.   People with celiac disease autoimmunity, or CDA, also test positive for certain antibodies called tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies or tTGA.    Celiac disease may also associated with depression, cognitive impairment, sleep problems and attention deficits in children.    Previous studies looked at whether parents knowing that their child tested positive for CDA had an impact on their reporting physical symptoms of celiac disease in their child. The current study is the first to examine how psychological symptoms were reported by mothers before they knew their children had CDA, the authors write in Pediatrics.   Agardh and his colleagues analyzed data from an international study designed to examine environmental triggers of type 1 diabetes and celiac disease in children who were at higher than average risk of those conditions because of family history. The current study included more than 4,000 children in the U.S., Finland, Germany and Sweden.   The children were enrolled as infants and visited clinics every three months until age 4 years, and then twice annually until the they were 15 years old. After age 2 years, the children were also screened for tTGA antibodies annually.   In addition to the clinical evaluations, researchers asked whether children were on gluten-free diets, and parents answered psychosocial questionnaires when the kids were between 3 and 4 years old and again when the kids were between 4 and 5 years old.    Overall, there were 66 children who had tested positive for CDA by the time they were about 3.5 years old but their mothers were not yet aware of their child’s diagnosis. There were also 40 children who fit this description by age 4.5 years. Another 440 children had tested positive by age 3 years and their parents were aware of it.   Researchers found that mothers who were unaware their children were CDA positive reported more child anxiety and depression, aggressive behavior and sleep problems compared with the mothers of children without CDA.    The mothers who were unaware their children had CDA also reported more child anxiety and depression, withdrawn behavior, aggressive behavior and sleep problems than those who knew their kids had CDA.    By the time kids were about 4.5 years old, however, there was no difference in psychological symptoms reported by mothers regardless of whether they were aware of their child’s CDA status.   The authors conclude that the younger, less verbal children may be more likely to act out in response to the physical symptoms of celiac compared to the slightly older kids. And its possible that once mothers know their child is CDA positive, they focus more on the physical symptoms of the disease and are less likely to report the psychological symptoms.    Agardh said celiac disease is often misdiagnosed in young children because the symptoms can be unclear. The study results suggest that physicians should suspect CDA or celiac disease in children with unclear or vague symptoms who are at risk, he added.   Melissa Rifkin, a registered dietitian with Montefiore Medical Center in New York noted that the study found following a gluten-free diet had no association with psychological functioning in the children with celiac disease.   “The findings itself are rare and unexpected. However, factors that may have contributed to this finding is the duration of the gluten free diet that was followed,” she said.  "
2m8IOsw,2017-02-22,Exercise linked to better breast cancer outcomes," (Reuters Health) - Several lifestyle changes can improve outcomes after a breast cancer diagnosis, but exercise is far and away the best habit to establish, researchers say.   Women with breast cancer, whether newly diagnosed or at any time in their “survivorship” phase, need to exercise regularly and avoid weight gain, said Dr. Ellen Warner from Odette Cancer Center at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in Toronto, who coauthored the research review.   Warner and her colleague Julie Hamer joined forces to review nearly 70 articles that addressed lifestyle modifications that might have an impact on the risk of breast cancer recurrence and survival after breast cancer.    They found that regular physical activity can reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by 40 percent compared to women who didn’t exercise. Unfortunately, less than 13 percent of women with breast cancer achieve the recommended 150 minutes per week of physical activity.    “Exercise has the greatest benefit on lowering risk of recurrence and has many other secondary benefits like helping with weight management (which itself lowers the risk of recurrence) and fewer side effects from chemo, radiation, and hormone therapy,” Warner told Reuters Health by email.    Gaining weight during or after breast cancer treatment is risky – it increases the chance of recurrence and decreases survival rates, the review concludes.    Women who are already overweight or obese also have a higher risk of recurrence and death, but it’s not clear whether weight loss actually improves those outcomes. Studies are underway to examine this further, the researchers write in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.    Does diet matter? Yes and no. Breast cancer recurrence rates are similar whether women eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and chicken or a diet high in processed grains, processed meats and red meat. But high dietary saturated fat can increase the risk of death from breast cancer. Soy products, however, do not increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence and might even reduce it.    “Women with breast cancer don’t need to make extreme diet changes (like cutting out meat, dairy, sugar, soy, etc.),” Warner said. “There is no evidence any of these are effective. They can eat anything in moderation and following Canada’s food guide would be helpful if they don’t know much about nutrition.”    Women with breast cancer – well, everyone, really – should stop smoking. It’s strongly associated with the risk of death from breast cancer, and stopping improves overall survival.   What about alcohol intake and vitamin supplementation? The evidence is limited and inconsistent, so further study is needed before making specific recommendations, the team notes.   “There’s a large ongoing Canadian study of women age 40 and under newly diagnosed with breast cancer called RUBY, and one of the projects in this study is to look at how various lifestyle factors (diet, exercises, supplements, etc.) affect prognosis for that specific age group,” Warner said.    “Adopting a healthy lifestyle is great but should never be seen as a substitute for conventional therapy,” she concluded.    In their review, the authors note that very few of the included studies met the highest standards of clinical trials.    Dr. Livia Augustin from St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto and the Fondazione Giovanni Pascale National Cancer Institute in Naples, Italy, has, along with others, designed a clinical trial (DEDiCa) to investigate whether low glycemic index diet, exercise and vitamin D reduces breast cancer recurrence.    “People with breast cancer suffer from several comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis, and therefore many health complications; therefore, quitting smoking, increasing vitamin D when necessary, increasing physical activity, and improving dietary aspects are crucial therapeutic targets to reduce complications and health care costs as well as help to live longer with a better quality of life,” Augustin told Reuters Health by email.  "
2mi99U1,2017-02-21,Stress hormone may help explain health advantages of marriage," (Reuters Health) - Married couples may be healthier than single, divorced or widowed adults at least in part because they have lower levels of a stress hormone associated with a variety of medical problems, a recent study suggests.    Previous research has linked marriage to a longer life and other health benefits, which could be due to the relationship itself or to other factors like higher household income, better medical insurance or improved access to care. The current study, however, offers fresh insight into another possible benefit of marriage: less stress.    For the study, researchers tested levels of cortisol, a hormone released under stress, in 572 healthy men and women aged 21 to 55. They found married individuals consistently had lower cortisol levels than people who never married or who were previously married.   “Our findings provide new and important initial insights into how our most intimate social relationships can ‘get under the skin’ to impact physical health,” said lead study author Brian Chin, a psychology researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.   “We aren’t able to draw any strong conclusions from our study about exactly how this happens, but we are able to make some educated guesses based on earlier research,” Chin added by email.   It’s possible, for example, that married people might have better access to care than single individuals because they have good health insurance through a spouse or more funds available to pay for care, Chin said. Being married might also help encourage people to stick to a healthier lifestyle or avoid behaviors that can lead to illness like smoking or excessive drinking.   To assess stress levels based on marital status, Chin and colleagues collected multiple cortisol samples throughout the day from each participant on three separate days.     The 292 people who never married were younger, averaging around 29 years old, compared with about 37 years old for the 160 married individuals in the study and an average age of 40 for the 56 adults who were previously married.    In addition to looking at overall cortisol levels, researchers also analyzed fluctuations in participants’ cortisol levels during the course of a day.   Typically, cortisol levels peak when a person wakes up and decline as the day progresses, the study team writes in Psychoneuroendocrinology.    Married people in the study had faster drops in cortisol levels during the day, a pattern that’s associated with health benefits including a lower risk of heart disease and longer survival among cancer patients, researchers note.    Differences in cortisol during the day between married and unmarried people were not due to variations in participants’ starting levels of cortisol at the beginning of the day.    Instead, it appeared that married people had a more rapidly accelerating decline in cortisol during the afternoons than people who were never married, though not individuals who had been previously married.    Married people might have lower cortisol levels and steeper declines in the hormone during the day because they’re more satisfied with their relationships and lack the kind of stress that’s associated with being in a poor relationship or being unmarried, the authors speculate.    However, the researchers note that some previous studies have not found a relationship between marital quality and changes in cortisol levels over the course of a day.    The current study isn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how marriage influences cortisol or stress levels or to assess any related health benefits, the researchers add.    “This study is exciting because we know being married is associated with better health but we don’t know why this association occurs,” said Kira Birditt, a researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Cortisol is a measure of stress response and may provide interesting insights into how relationships affect health,” Birditt added by email. “Unfortunately, this study did not include assessments of daily stress exposure or daily social interactions to understand if these associations may be accounted for by variations in the daily lived experiences of married versus unmarried individuals.”  "
2lj2zPt,2017-02-21,Fructose tied to advanced liver disease in children and teens," (Reuters Health) - Obese youth who have some buildup of fats in their livers and a diet high in fructose may be more likely to develop serious chronic liver damage common in adult alcoholics, a recent study suggests.    Most people have a little bit of fat in their liver. Fatty liver disease can occur when more than 5 percent of the liver by weight is made up of fat. Excessive drinking can damage the liver and cause fat to accumulate, a condition known as alcoholic fatty liver. When people don’t drink much, they can still develop non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is associated with obesity and certain eating habits.    NAFLD is the most common liver disease in western children, the authors write in Journal of Hepatology. And it is now recognized as the liver’s “manifestation” of metabolic syndrome – a constellation of traits and symptoms that raise a person’s risk for diabetes and heart disease - they add.    For the current study, researchers examined data on 271 obese children and teens in Italy and the UK who underwent liver biopsies to assess fat accumulation. They used food questionnaires to assess fructose consumption and also examined blood levels of uric acid, which can be elevated in people with chronic liver disease.     Foods high in fructose include anything with high fructose corn syrup, like sweetened drinks, candy and many processed foods, but this type of sugar also occurs naturally in fruits, fruit juices and honey.   “Cells don’t use fructose for energy, so 100 percent of the fructose you eat is metabolized in your liver,” said study co-author Dr. Valerio Nobili of Bambino Gesu Children’s Hospital in Rome.   Instead, the body turns fructose into fatty acids, the “bad” kind of cholesterol and triglycerides, which are stored as body fat, Nobili said by email. “That’s why excess fructose going into the liver is followed by the formation of fatty liver,” Nobili added.    All of the study participants had at least some degree of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, researchers report.    About 38 percent of them, or 102 participants, had more extensive liver damage known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that happens when fat buildup leads to swelling in the liver and impairs liver function.    Roughly 47 patients with NASH had high uric acid, compared with 30 percent of participants without NASH, the study also found.    Overall, 53 percent of the children reported always skipping breakfast and another 26 percent said they had a morning meal infrequently.   However, 95 percent of the youth said they regularly had a morning snack and 89 percent routinely had an afternoon snack. Morning snacks most often included crackers, pizza and salty food, while afternoon snacks often consisted of biscuits or yogurt.    About 47 percent of the children ate cereal daily, while 43 percent had vegetables every day and 40 percent consumed fruit each day.    Roughly nine in 10 participants had soda at least once a week.    The youth with NASH had higher average consumption of fructose. Their median intake – meaning half of them consumed more – was about 70 grams of fructose daily. Median fructose consumption of children and teens without NASH was about 53 grams a day.    One limitation of the study is that it relied on children and teens to accurately recall and report what they ate, the authors note. The study also didn’t examine whether there was a difference in liver outcomes based on how much fructose participants got from whole fruits, fruit juices or sodas.    “Our understanding of the role of fructose in fatty liver is still evolving,” said Dr. Jeffrey Schwimmer, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego and director of the Fatty Liver Clinic at Rady Children’s Hospital.    “We don’t think that the impact of fructose from fruit is the same as fructose from drinks,” Schwimmer, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    The difference in fructose consumption between youth with and without NASH in the study would be in one glass of sweetened tea or soda, but also the amount a child might get from pears or grapes, Schwimmer added.    His advice to parents: “Limit added sugars while further research is done to better understand” how fructose impacts the liver.    "
2kvfxer,2017-02-20,Swim fitness trackers work well enough for recreational swimmers," (Reuters Health) – Popular fitness trackers made for swimmers are accurate enough for recreational use to track and improve performance, but not for use in training by competitive swimmers, a recent study concludes.   Researchers tested two products, the Finis Swimsense and Garmin Swim, and found them to be comparable to each other and pretty good at tracking distance, laps and different types of swimming strokes.   Stroke counts were not as consistent, however. And the devices’ ability to recognize different stroke types is likely to vary more widely with amateur swimmers than with competitive athletes, the researchers note.   “As part of the so-called ‘quantified self’ movement, individuals who swim as part of a recreational health and fitness program can benefit from monitoring some basic indices of their performance,” said senior study author Gearoid O Laighin of the Center for Research in Medical Devices at the National University of Ireland in Galway.   “Swimming ranks amongst the most popular leisure activities worldwide,” O Laighin told Reuters Health by email. “The general health benefits of regular swimming are well established and swimming is one of the few sports that can be enjoyed during all stages of life.”   O Laighin and colleagues tested the two swim fitness trackers by following 10 national competitive swimmers — five men and five women — during 60 laps of swimming. The swimmers wore both activity monitors while doing intervals of the butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and frontcrawl. The devices identified stroke type, swim distance, lap time, stroke count, stroke rate, stroke length and average speed. The data was compared against underwater video recordings for accuracy.   Both devices accurately identified the four swim strokes and accurately counted swim distance and laps during the middle of an interval. However, laps performed at the beginning and end of an interval weren’t always accurate, and stroke count measurements were off by a few counts in all but two occasions. These small errors also affect the stroke rate, stroke length and average speed numbers since they’re based on lap times and stroke counts, the study authors write in PLoS ONE.   The Garmin Swim correctly identified the four swimming strokes with 95.4 percent overall sensitivity, and the Finis Swimsense was slightly more sensitive at 96.4 percent. With total distance, the Garmin tracker was three laps short, all for the frontcrawl stroke. The Finis tracker registered the correct number of laps but showed variations within the strokes. Both devices showed errors in lap times at the beginning of lap intervals.   “It’s great to see researchers dive into the details of the devices, and the numbers came out well across the board,” said C.J. Fiala, spokesperson for Finis Swimsense in Livermore, California. “When creating the product, we wouldn’t accept a large margin of error, and we believe this is the most accurate it can get.”   In general, both devices overestimated stroke counts in all intervals except with the butterfly, which the trackers tended to underestimate. Overall, accuracy was lowest with the breaststroke.   The varying accuracy may be related to stroke technique and how individual swimmers perform, O Laighin said. The error margin may likely increase when the trackers are used by recreational swimmers rather than elite swimmers.   “Although activity trackers have been increasing in popularity, it has been difficult to measure water-based activities due to waterproofing issues,” said James Sanders of the Movement Insights Lab at the National Center for Sport and Exercise Medicine in Leicestershire, UK, who wasn’t involved with the study.   “These two swimming sensors are highly influenced by technique and stroke mechanics, so the results should be interpreted with caution by a recreational swimmer whose technique may be unrefined,” Sanders told Reuters Health by email.   The Garmin Swim sells for $149.99 and the Finis Swimsense sells for $179.99. There was no financial assistance from either company for the study.   Garmin media representatives didn’t return calls or emails requesting comment.   “Understanding what you’re doing in the water gives you the opportunity to improve your skills,” Fiala said. “If you have inaccurate results, you’re not getting a real picture of what you’re doing and won’t know how to improve.”  "
2lDitW1,2017-02-20,Company-funded studies of approved drugs may not catch safety issues," (Reuters Health) - Studies drug companies fund after medicines go on sale may be too small to detect rare side effects, a recent German study suggests.    Even if these so-called post-marketing studies do uncover previously undetected adverse events, physicians conducting the trials are often required to keep results confidential, limiting the potential for regulators or patients to learn about safety issues, according to the study in The BMJ.   When drugs are approved based on tests in only a few thousand patients, very little is known about long-term safety or the potential for rare side effects to occur when tens of thousands of people take the medicines, said lead study author Dr. Angela Spelsberg, medical director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center in Aachen, Germany.   “The fact that many physicians are obliged by contracts to handle adverse drug reactions as confidential business information rather than reporting them is very disturbing,” Spelsberg added by email. “In light of the indispensable role of general practitioners and clinicians in detecting, diagnosing and publicly reporting adverse drug reactions, this means a very big threat to public safety.”   For the study, Spelsberg and colleagues made freedom of information requests to three regulatory authorities responsible for registering post-marketing studies in Germany and obtained data on 558 studies.   On average, these studies had about 2,300 patients and 270 physicians. Trials that include so many doctors and so few patients can have lower data quality because it’s cumbersome to effectively train and monitor so many physicians, Spelsberg said.    Doctors were paid 441 euros per patient on average to participate in the studies, and 19,424 euros on average per trial. In some trials, doctors earned in excess of 2 million euros.    The studies analyzed included a wide variety of drugs and non-pharmaceutical products, and only one third examined recently approved medicines. About 12 percent of the studies assessed non-prescription drugs, while about 15 percent looked at biotech medicines and 11 percent evaluated cancer treatments.    Not one adverse event report could be identified from any of the 558 post-marketing studies.    Less than 1 percent of the studies could be verified as published in scientific journals.    One limitation of the current study is that it looked at data from notifications to regulators but not real trial data, the authors note.    Researchers also may have overestimated the number of participating physicians because doctors often work on multiple post-marketing studies, the authors also point out. In addition, they lacked data on any post-marketing trial results published after 2015.    Still, the study offers fresh insight into several potential shortcomings of post-marketing drug studies, said Dr. Barbara Mintzes of the University of Sydney in Australia.    “When a drug first comes to market it has been tested on average in 2,000 to 3,000 people, too few people to uncover most rare serious harmful drug effects,” Mintzes, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Often, patients at greatest risk of harm like the frail elderly or people with several serious health conditions are excluded from the trials, so post-marketing safety studies are very important.”   When post-marketing studies aren’t done, aren’t publicized, or are too small to uncover rare side effects, patients can be exposed to unsafe or ineffective medicines, said Stacie Dusetzina, a researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Before the drug is approved there is very strict oversight and management by sponsors; after the drug is approved the follow-through on reporting is more mixed,” Dusetzina added by email. “Finding the right balance is important for ensuring that patients have timely access to drugs and that we know the risks and benefits for most patients.”  "
2lffyQy,2017-02-17,Tai chi tied to reduced fall risk in older adults," (Reuters Health) - Seniors who practice tai chi - a Chinese meditation practice that combines deep breathing and slow, fluid movements - may be less likely to fall than their peers who don’t do this type of exercise, a recent study suggests.    Researchers examined data from 18 previously published trials of tai chi for fall prevention with a combined 3,824 participants aged 65 and older.    Tai chi was associated with a 20 percent lower risk of falling at least once and a 31 percent drop in the number of falls, the analysis found.    “This is a fairly significant finding because tai chi is an activity that can be easily taught and that people can do independently at home or at their workplace or at the retirement center on their own or in a group,” said Jean-Michel Brismee, a physical therapy researcher at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center and University Medical Center in Lubbock.   “So in regard to cost and preserving independence and health it is significant because people do not have to go to the gym or a special facility as they can do it anywhere,” Brismee, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.    Worldwide, up to 40 percent of people over 65 and about half of people over 80 fall each year, researchers note in BMJ Open. Falls are often associated with considerable decline in mobility, independence and quality of life and are a leading cause of death in older adults.    For the study, Zhi-Guan Huang of Guangzhou Sport University in China and colleagues analyzed data from published trials that randomly assigned older adults to either receive tai chi lessons or join a control group that didn’t get this intervention.    Overall, 10 seniors would need to practice tai chi in order to avoid one fall, Huang and colleagues estimated.    When researchers accounted for how often seniors practiced tai chi, how much time they spent at it, the style of tai chi and the falling risk for individual patients, they still found these exercises associated with a lower risk of falling. Sometimes the fall risk appeared smaller but the difference between the tai chi groups and control groups was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance, however.    Increasing the frequency of tai chi sessions from once a week to more than three times weekly was associated with a dramatic improvement in risk reduction, from 5 percent to 64 percent.   One limitation of the study is that it examined data from trials where participants knew what intervention was being tested and whether they received it, which has the potential to bias results, the authors note.    Even so, the results confirm previous research showing tai chi can improve balance, flexibility, strength of knee extension and reduce the risk of falls in older adults, said Dr. Chenchen Wang, director of the Center for Complimentary and Integrative Medicine at Tufts Medical Center in Boston.   “Many important components include: exercise, breathing techniques, awareness of the body, focused attention, mindfulness, balance and function, visualization and relaxation,” Wang, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “These components also positively impact health by improving self-efficacy, psychosocial functioning, and depression and can help patients bolster self-confidence, which also helps balance and coordination to avoid falls,” Wang added.    The complex nature of tai chi exercise sequences can also support cognitive function because it requires steady effort to coordinate multiple movements at the same time, said Dr. Rome Lauche of the University of Technology in Sydney and the Australian Research Center in Complementary and Integrative Medicine.    “For frail elderly patients who can’t go to the gym and conduct conventional exercises, or those with a preference towards relaxing mind/body interventions, the slow and flowing nature of tai chi might be the right choice,” Lauche, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “For patients who have already fallen, it is important to undergo a medical examination first.”  "
2keeNFn,2017-02-17,Prescription-drug monitoring cuts doctor-shopping for painkillers," (Reuters Health) - State programs that require physicians to check drug registries before writing prescriptions appeared to slash the odds of doctor-shopping for opioid pain relievers, a new study found.   “Our study shows that prescription-drug monitoring programs are a promising component of a multifaceted strategy to address the opioid epidemic,” Ryan Mutter, one of the study authors, said in a phone interview. He is a health economist at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration in Rockville, Maryland.   Mutter and other researchers analyzed annual nationwide surveys of drug use and health from 2004 until 2014, when 36 states implemented prescription-drug monitoring programs, or PDMPs.   PDMPs are state-run electronic databases designed to track prescribing of controlled substances and to identify people at high risk of using opioids for nonmedical purposes. Every state except Missouri now has a drug-monitoring program. Some states have mandatory programs requiring physicians to participate, and other states have voluntary programs.    The study, reported in the journal Addictive Behaviors, found that in states where physicians were required to check an electronic database before writing an opioid prescription, the odds that two or more doctors would be giving pain relievers for nonmedical purposes to a single patient were reduced by 80 percent. States that implemented voluntary monitoring programs showed a 56 percent reduction in the odds of doctor-shopping.   States with mandatory prescription-drug monitoring programs reduced the use of painkillers for nonmedical purposes by an average of 20 days a year, the study found. States with voluntary prescription-drug monitoring program reduced the use of painkillers for nonmedical purposes by an average of 10 days a year.   “Overall, this, as well as other studies, suggests there’s promise for prescription-drug monitoring programs,” Dr. Stephen W. Patrick said in a phone interview. “But they aren’t a panacea.”   “We really need a comprehensive approach. It isn’t one thing that will help get us out of the opioid epidemic,” said Patrick, a pediatrician at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. He treats newborns struggling with the symptoms of withdrawal from opioids prescribed to their mothers and was not involved in the new study.   Every day, 91 Americans die from an opioid overdose, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1999, deaths from prescription opioids have quadrupled, as have sales of opioids, including the painkillers oxycodone (Oxycontin) and hydrocodone (Vicodin).    The number of PDMPs has expanded rapidly across states since 2000, but prior studies have shown mixed results about their effectiveness, the study authors write.   One previous study found that drug-monitoring programs help prevent 10 opioid-overdose deaths a day in the U.S., yet improvements could save another two people a day. States with the most robust programs – ones that tracked a greater number of potentially addictive medications and updated their databases at least weekly – saw the biggest drops in overdose deaths, the previous study showed.    Public health advocates worry that an unintended consequence of drug-monitoring programs could be that opioid users would seek drugs illegally and turn to heroin, the authors write. But the current study found that PDMPs did not lead to an increase in people starting to use heroin.   Lead author Mir M. Ali said in a phone interview he found it “reassuring” that drug-monitoring programs were not responsible for opioid users substituting heroin. Ali is a health economist at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.   “In any situation where you’re limiting supply, people might begin to substitute,” Patrick said. “What we really need to do is focus on how we get control of the prescription opioid epidemic.”   "
2lbKrpd,2017-02-16,Weak thigh muscles tied to knee osteoarthritis in women," (Reuters Health) - Women with weaker thigh muscles may be more likely to develop knee osteoarthritis, a recent study suggests.    When women had less strength in muscles known as the knee extensors, or quadriceps, which help straighten the leg for standing, climbing and kicking, they were 47 percent more likely to develop knee arthritis than women who had stronger knee extensors, the study found.    Weakness in the knee flexor muscles on the back of the legs, also known as hamstrings, was associated with 41 percent greater odds of knee osteoarthritis in women.    Thigh muscle strength didn’t appear to influence the risk of knee osteoarthritis for men, researchers report in Arthritis Care and Research.   “While our recent study has highlighted the important role of strong thigh muscles in reducing the risk of knee osteoarthritis development, particularly in women, it is not possible to guarantee that having strong thigh muscles will protect women from developing knee osteoarthritis because there are many other factors that play into the disease,” said lead study author Dr. Adam Culvenor, a researcher at Paracelsus Medical University in Salzburg, Austria.   “Nevertheless, our results suggest that optimizing quadriceps and hamstring strength may help to lower the risk of developing knee osteoarthritis,” Culvenor added by email.   For the study, Culvenor and colleagues examined data from MRIs of thigh muscles and muscle strength tests for 186 adults with knee osteoarthritis and another 186 without the condition.    Because obesity is independently associated with an increased risk of knee osteoarthritis, researchers also examined data on participants’ weight relative to their height, a measure known as body mass index (BMI).    At the start of the study, participants were 61 years old on average.    Even after adjusting for BMI, women with weaker knee extensor muscles were 33 percent more likely to have knee osteoarthritis, and women with weaker flexor muscles were 28 percent more likely to develop knee arthritis.    With men, even after researchers accounted for BMI, they still didn’t find a statistically meaningful association between thigh muscle strength and knee arthritis.    While the role of thigh muscle weakness as a risk factor for knee osteoarthritis is not fully understood, the quadriceps can help prevent the development and progression of this knee condition by acting as shock absorbers and stabilizers for the knee, Culvenor said.    Without strong quadriceps muscles, more stress is placed on the cartilage within the knee, and this has been suggested to induce a degenerative process, wearing down of the cartilage and ultimately osteoarthritis, Culvenor added.    The different results between men and women could be explained by the muscles’ response to greater body mass, Culvenor said. In men, a greater body mass was associated with increased muscle strength, whereas muscles didn’t respond and get stronger in women with a greater body mass.    “This is likely because muscles in men with greater body mass have more contractile tissue and strength, whereas in women with greater body mass more non-contractile adipose tissue is deposited within the muscle and hence cannot produce as much force,” Culvenor said.    Limitations of the study include the lack of an exact measurement of voluntary muscle activation to determine thigh muscle strength or a precise assessment of intramuscular fat, the authors note. Both of these details might help explain differences between men and women in the study.   Still, the results make sense because muscle strength, body structure and usage of the joint affects the odds that knee osteoarthritis will develop as well as its severity, said Dinesh Bhatia, a researcher at North Eastern Hill University in Meghalaya, India, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “If the muscles are weaker people try to overcompensate using their normal muscles for a certain period of time, after which it can no longer handle the stress/ strain and gives in,” Bhatia said by email. “Hence, therapists advise muscle strengthening and other techniques to reduce overburdening of the joint and avoid or reduce knee osteoarthritis pain.”  "
2lj3DDZ,2017-02-16,Language barriers may block access to kidney transplant waiting list," (Reuters Health) - Kidney transplant candidates who live in ZIP codes with more non-English speakers are less likely to make it onto the U.S. active waiting list, according to a recent study.   Those with linguistic barriers - especially in Hispanic and Asian households - also wait longer for a transplant evaluation or never complete one at all.   “The problem likely extends further than merely language. Cultural and educational barriers likely also play a role,” said senior study author Edmund Huang of the Kidney Transplant Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.   “Transplant centers and referring nephrologists should recognize that these populations may need additional attention in guiding them through the evaluation process,” he told Reuters Health.   The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network currently has more than 98,000 candidates on the kidney transplant waiting list. Typically, a third of these patients are listed as inactive due to an incomplete transplant evaluation, and about a third of inactive candidates never become active. Figuring out why candidates remain inactive and how to move them to active status could reduce health disparities in underserved communities, the study authors write in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.    Huang and colleagues looked at nationwide organ transplant data, along with ZIP code data from the 2000 United States census, for more than 84,000 kidney transplant candidates from 2004-2012.    They defined a household as “linguistically isolated” if all members over age 14 spoke a language other than English and spoke English less than “very well.” The researchers then categorized neighborhoods where transplant candidates lived into one of five groups based on the percentage of households that were linguistically isolated: less than 1 percent, between 1 and 5 percent, between 5 and 10 percent, between 10 and 20 percent or more than 20 percent.   During the study, more than 70 percent of candidates moved to active status. These candidates were more often younger, male, more educated and more likely to have private health insurance. Inactive candidates generally lived in communities with lower education and more poverty. Although Hispanic, Asian and black candidates were all less likely to achieve active status, Hispanic and Asian candidates were more likely to live in areas with the highest levels of linguistic isolation.   Overall, 78 percent of candidates who lived in communities with less than 1 percent of linguistic isolation converted to active status. In communities that were more than 20 percent linguistically isolated, 69 percent converted to active status, researchers found.   “Despite our best efforts to make kidney transplantation accessible to all suitable patients with end-stage renal disease, there are barriers,” Huang said.    Although the nationwide kidney allocation policy changed in 2014 to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in kidney transplantation, the problem starts sooner than allocation, Huang added.    “When people need a transplant, they want to be sure that kidneys are allocated because of medical necessity and that they are not disadvantaged because of their social status,” said Alicia Fernandez of the University of California at San Francisco, who was not involved in the study.    “Kidney transplant is a scarce resource, and it is important that scarce medical resources be distributed fairly,” said Fernandez, who has studied language barriers in healthcare, particularly for Latinos with diabetes. “That has generally been understood to mean without unduly valuing social factors, such as wealth or race,” she said by email.   One limitation of the study is that although language barriers are likely tied to education and income barriers, the study authors can’t say for sure. Other systemic biases could prevent patients from completing evaluations or joining the waitlist, said Leah Karliner of the University of California at San Francisco, who wasn’t involved with the study but has studied language barriers to healthcare access and how professional interpreters may help.   “It is unclear how many of these patients had access to professional interpretation in their health care settings and for navigating the complex health care system to complete their evaluation,” she told Reuters Health by email. “An important starting place would be ensuring access to professional interpretation for all patients.”  "
2l1Vtzr,2017-02-15,Wide variation in willingness of ER doctors to prescribe painkillers," (Reuters Health) - A national comparison of emergency room physicians has uncovered a broad range of prescribing patterns for painkillers, and high-volume prescribers may be encouraging long-term use of the drugs among their elderly patients.   Based on medical histories of more than 377,000 Medicare recipients, researchers found that doctors considered frequent prescribers were 300 percent more likely to give out prescriptions for painkillers than low-volume physicians in the same hospital, and those heavy-prescribers were 30 percent more likely to give their patients prescriptions for longer periods.   Yet their patients were only 3 percent more likely to show up at the hospital to be treated for a long-term drug problem, compared with the patients of doctors who were more restrained in their prescribing habits.   “These results suggest that an increased likelihood of receiving an opioid for even one encounter could drive clinically significant future long-term opioid use and potentially increased adverse outcomes among the elderly,” the research team writes in the New England Journal of Medicine.   But it’s not clear “whether this variation reflects overprescription by some prescribers and whether it is amenable to intervention,” they conclude.   A 3 percent increase in hospitalization for opioid problems “isn’t necessarily a large volume, but a little bit of a lot is still going to be a lot” which is why an increase in risk for the elderly is a reason for concern, said Dr. Evan Schwarz of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who was not involved in the research.   “To us, I think it’s a bigger effect than it seems,” lead study author Dr. Michael Barnett of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston told Reuters Health. “These are elderly folks who are coming to the emergency room who haven’t been using opiates at all. This is not a high-risk population. We expect low rates.”   Among elderly Medicare patients, opioid overdoses quadrupled from 1993 to 2012. Not only does excessive opioid use spark addiction in this group, it increases their likelihood of deadly falls.   Whether the rates are increasing because doctors have become too quick to prescribe the drugs is a matter for debate, particularly when doctors often have little guidance for how to best use them.   “It’s not like there’s one approach that’s going to magically not overtreat or not undertreat pain. It’s hard,” Barnett said. “But I think right now it’s really a Wild West of guesswork in terms of how we make decisions.”   The study focused on emergency room physicians because patients coming into the ER usually don’t know who will be treating them, and the researchers looked at Medicare records from 2008 to 2011.    Among the “high-intensity” prescribers (who gave out the drugs to 24.1 percent of their patients), the rate of long-term opioid use – for six months or more - in their patients was 1.51 percent.   In comparison, among “low-intensity” prescribers (who were giving out opioid prescriptions to 7.3 percent of their patients), the rate was 1.16 percent.   The patients given more drugs were only 3 percent more likely to show up at a hospital within 12 months with an opioid-related drug problem, but the rates were high in both groups - 9.96 percent with high-prescribing doctors versus 9.73 percent with low-prescribing physicians.   The odds of a hospital visit for a fall or fracture were also significantly higher for the patients of high-prescribing doctors, but not spectacularly so.    “The thing this study doesn’t tell us is, was the prescription appropriate or why the high-volume providers are providing prescriptions,” said Schwarz. “We don’t want to assume that all of this is inappropriate.”   Both Schwarz and Barnett noted that the problem of overprescribing may be lessening.   “These data are coming from the peak of opioid prescribing because I think we’ve started to see a downturn, starting in 2015 or so,” Schwarz said. “It may mean the pendulum is slowly starting to swing back in the other direction.”   Contributing to the problem, he said, is the fact that “doctors frequently don’t tell patients that opioids have a risk of developing some kind of dependence or chronic use. Many people might take a second look at whether they really want that prescription if the doctor actually told them about that risk.”  "
2lICPue,2017-02-15,Survival rates for extremely preterm babies improving in U.S.," (Reuters Health) - The first decade of the 2000s saw a small but significant increase in the survival of extremely premature infants without early neurodevelopmental problems, according to a study of nearly 4,500 babies born at 11 U.S. medical centers.   “We’ve seen a slight increase in the number of infants who survived without signs of impairment at 2 years of age,” chief author Dr. Noelle Younge of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, told Reuters Health.   For the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Younge and her colleagues looked at survival rates, with and without disability, for these extreme preemies over three periods - from 2000 to 2003, from 2004 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2011.   A typical pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born before 37 weeks are considered preterm. Those born much earlier, at around 22 to 24 weeks gestation, are considered to be at the limit of viability and likely to have serious neurological and other problems.   Understanding the likelihood of survival and the odds for disabilities can help doctors counsel parents of extreme preemies about their child’s prognosis, the study team writes.   Younge’s team found that among all children born at 22 to 24 weeks, rates of survival without neurodevelopmental impairment - which was assessed at age 18 to 22 months of corrected age - increased by 4 percentage points from the earliest study period to the most recent.   But the actual odds were small at the start and remained small, with impairment-free survival going from 16 percent to 20 percent.   The death rate declined from 70 percent in the first period to 64 percent in the most recent period.   The real improvements were seen in children born at 23 weeks and 24 weeks. The impairment-free rates went from 7 percent to 13 percent in the 23-week group and from 28 percent to 32 percent in the 24-week group.   The researchers said lower rates of infection and the greater use of steroids given to mothers to help the fetus mature faster may be responsible for the improvements.    But those interventions have their limits.   There was no comparable improvement over the 12-year study period for babies born at 22 weeks gestation. Only 1 percent survived without neurodevelopmental impairment.   The raw survival rates showed a similar pattern, with most of the improvement reflecting higher survival rates among infants born in the 24th week.    In that group, the rates went from 49 percent in the earliest period to 56 percent in the most recent one.    In comparison, in 2008-2011, survival rates were 24 percent if the baby made it to 23 weeks gestation compared to just 3 percent if the baby was born at 22 weeks.   “With the 22-weekers we didn’t see a lot of difference,” said Younge, a neonatologist and assistant professor of pediatrics at Duke. “At 23 weeks we did see an improvement over time.”   That seems to be the key demarcation point because “between 22 and 23 weeks, the lungs are really maturing. The brain is maturing. So in this 22-week window certain infants have met maturation milestones and can survive,” she said.    The researchers caution that “there is likely to be substantial variation” in the long-term functioning of children classified as having neurodevelopmental impairment in early childhood.   “Although early neurodevelopmental assessment is important for the timely identification of children at risk for long-term neurologic impairment or developmental delay, its capacity to predict later functioning is limited,” the study team writes. “Many children will catch up to their peers by school age, whereas other children will have persistent impairment. Conversely, some children without signs of neurodevelopmental impairment in early childhood will have impairments that manifest at school age.”  "
2lLwPUX,2017-02-15,‘Speed’ and other recreational stimulants tied to heart damage," (Reuters Health) - Middle-aged adults who use recreational amphetamines like “speed,” “ecstasy” or “ice” may develop a prematurely aging heart and experience health problems normally associated with older people, a recent study suggests.    People may crave the euphoric feelings produced by amphetamines, but these drugs have long been linked to heart attack, stroke, artery wall damage, bleeding in the brain, abnormal heart rhythm and sudden cardiac death, said lead study author Dr. Stuart Reece of the University of Western Australia in Crawley.   “It makes sense that all these different issues are linked by an underlying acceleration of the aging effect,” Reece said by email. “We found that the effect was very considerable indeed.”   Amphetamines are a stimulant and they send what’s known as the sympathetic nervous system, or “fight or flight” hormone adrenaline into overdrive. Previous research has linked these drugs to premature aging of the skin, and the current study suggests amphetamines might also prematurely age the heart.    For the study, researchers measured blood flow through a main artery in the upper arm and forearm for 713 people in their 30s and 40s at a clinic for substance misuse. Arteries harden with age.    Each patient was asked about drug use and placed in one of four groups: non-smokers, smokers, amphetamine users and methadone users. Methadone is a substitute for heroin given to people trying to overcome addiction to that illegal drug.    Researchers used a blood pressure cuff and monitoring system to calculate what they described as biological vascular age by matching the extent of hardening in the arteries with chronological age, gender and height.    Almost all of the 55 amphetamine users in the study had used these stimulants within the previous week, and about half had used the drugs in the previous day before doing the blood pressure cuff tests.    Even after accounting for several risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as weight, cholesterol levels and inflammation, amphetamine use was still independently associated with an “advancement” of cardiovascular age, researchers report in Heart Asia.    The accelerated aging seen with amphetamines appeared to be even more pronounced than with tobacco use and was equivalent to about a 25 percent increase over chronological age, Reece told Reuters Health. In other words, adding a decade of aging to an average 40-year-old.     Beyond the small number of amphetamine users in the study, another limitation is the lack of data on how much of the stimulants people used, the authors note.    All stimulants work by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical linked to pleasure, movement and attention.    Stimulants like Adderall, Ritalin and Concerta are often prescribed to children and adults diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in doses that are not associated with cardiovascular problems.    “At therapeutic doses, stimulant medications have been shown to be safe,” said Dr. Jose Martinez-Raga, a researcher at the University of Valencia in Spain who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Amphetamine abuse implies using these stimulant drugs over long periods of time and generally with much larger doses than those commonly prescribed for medical reasons,” Martinez-Raga added by email.    When people take amphetamines in higher doses than those typically prescribed, people can experience a rapid surge of dopamine in the brain that can trigger feelings of euphoria and increase the risk of addiction.    “No medical patient smokes or shoots their pills,” Reece said. “These high levels are very addictive, they are very damaging, and they produce great spikes in blood pressure and heart rate which are straining and damaging both for the heart itself and for the blood vessels.”  "
2lhzdSt,2017-02-15,"With colon cancer, smokers may be less likely to survive"," (Reuters Health) - Current smokers diagnosed with colorectal cancer are more likely to die from it than former smokers or people who never tried cigarettes, a recent study suggests.    Researchers examined five-year survival odds for 18,166 people diagnosed with colorectal cancer and found current smokers were 14 percent more likely to die during the study period than people who never smoked. The effect was seen mainly among smokers treated with surgery but no chemotherapy, who were 21 percent more likely to die.    “We don’t know exactly how smoking causes colorectal cancer in this case or makes prognosis worse; however it clearly does just like in many other human cancers,” said Dr. David Weinberg of the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia.    “Not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, exercising regularly and drinking in moderation have been shown to consistently reduce risk for many common cancers including lung and colorectal cancers,” Weinberg, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.    Worldwide each year, about 750,000 new cases of colorectal cancers are diagnosed, with about two-thirds developing in the colon.     For the current study, researchers examined cancer registry data for patients diagnosed with colorectal cancers in Ireland from 1994 to 2012.    Most patients were at least 55 years old at the time of diagnosis, though 13 percent were younger. About 35 percent of patients were at least 75 years old.    Overall, 3,572 patients, or 20 percent, were current smokers, and another 4,199, or 23 percent, were former smokers.    About 53 percent of them had only surgery, while 33 percent had chemotherapy in addition to operations and 5 percent had only chemotherapy. Roughly 10 percent of patients had none of these interventions.    During five years of follow-up, 7,488 people died of cancer, researchers report in Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics.    After adjusting for patients’ age and marital status as well as characteristics of their cancer, current smokers had a statistically meaningful increased risk of death but former smokers did not.    When researchers examined different treatment groups, they found the increased risk of death associated with smoking was limited to patients who were only treated with surgery.    The study authors write that more research is needed to understand this higher mortality among surgery-only patients, but there are several possible explanations. Past studies have found that smokers are more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage and to present as emergency cases requiring immediate surgery, for example. And people who received chemo in addition to surgery might have been in generally better health than the surgery-only group.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that smoking causes colorectal cancer or deaths from the disease, the authors note. Researchers also didn’t have data on how much patients smoked after their diagnosis, other lifestyle factors that may influence survival, or how long patients lived without tumors growing and spreading.    Lead study author Dr. Linda Sharp of Newcastle University in the U.K. didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.    The current study is the largest to date to demonstrate the link between smoking and colorectal cancer that has been seen in previous studies, said Dr. Sidney Winawer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.    Too often, people tend to think of smoking only in terms of lung cancer, and not other malignancies or diseases that are tied to the habit, Winawer, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “People are generally deniers especially when it comes to pleasurable habits or when a life style change is recommended for their health,” Winawer added. “They need to be told over and over about colorectal cancer, cancer of the liver, pancreas, esophagus, kidney, bladder, head and neck, etc. as well as heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, reflux, etc.”    “This study clearly shows that immediate and long term survival is affected by smoking, more by continued smoking but also by prior smokers,” Winawer said.

2kr2SUK,2017-02-14,Don&#039;t reach for pills for most chronic low back pain," (Reuters Health) - People should try non-drug treatment options like massage or stretching for most cases of chronic low back pain before choosing treatment with over-the-counter or prescription drugs, according to new guidelines.   If the pain began recently, the guidelines recommend superficial heat, massage, acupuncture or spinal manipulation. If patients wish to take medication, they should use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, or skeletal muscle relaxants prescribed by a doctor. Acetaminophen and steroids are not recommended for low back pain, according to the guidelines.   But for chronic low back pain - defined as pain that’s lasted more than 12 weeks - the American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends people hold off on medications.   The new guidelines apply to low back pain that does not radiate to other parts of the body like the legs, said Dr. Nitin Damle of the Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who is president of the ACP.   Patients with low back pain that radiates to other parts of the body need further evaluation, he told Reuters Health.   Low back pain is one of the most common reasons people visit U.S. doctors’ offices each year, according to the ACP in the Annals of Internal Medicine. About a quarter of U.S. adults report low back pain at least one day during the previous three months.   “Most back pain is self-limited,” said Damle. “It’s common, will go away given enough time and patients can help themselves initially by trying some heat and stretching before going to see a physician.”   The new guidelines are based on a review of studies that looked at the use of drug and non-drug therapies for low back pain. The review did not look at creams or injections, however.   Based on the review, the ACP recommends that people who have been suffering with chronic low back pain try non-drug therapies such as exercise, acupuncture, mindfulness-based stress reduction, tai chi, yoga, biofeedback, cognitive behavioral therapy or spinal manipulation.   If those methods don’t work, the guidelines say the next step should be NSAIDs or the pain medications duloxetine, which is marketed as Cymbalta, or tramadol, which is marketed as Ultram.   Opioids should only be considered as last resorts, and only prescribed after doctors discuss their risks and benefits with patients.   “If you’re going to have to use opioids, use them in the smallest dose possible with the least frequency and smallest prescription,” said Damle.   The new recommendations are very reasonable, said Dr. Joel Press, who is physiatrist-in-chief at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City.   “Anything you can do with these non-pharmaceuticals that can get you moving faster is going to get you better in the end,” said Press, who was not involved in crafting the new guidelines.   “I hope this reinforces to physicians and patients that a lot of these non-pharmaceutical treatments can have a lot of success,” he told Reuters Health.

2ktvhJS,2017-02-14,Cost of skin creams and ointments may depend on who gives prescription," (Reuters Health) - Patients who want to pay less for prescription skin creams and ointments for inflammatory diseases like psoriasis may want to consider seeing their primary care doctor instead of a specialist, a U.S. study suggests.    That’s because dermatologists and other specialists are three times more likely than primary care providers to prescribe brand name versions of drugs known as topical immunomodulators, which includes treatments such as corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors and vitamin D analogs, the study found.    For a 30-day supply, brand prescriptions were associated with about $174 higher average total costs and roughly $27.00 more in average out-of-pocket costs for patients than generic alternatives, the study of Medicare claims also found.    “We would assume dermatologists are treating more extensive diseases and thus requiring higher volumes of topical treatments but this was not available in the database,” said senior study author Dr. Benjamin Kaffenberger of Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus.   “This data is not linked to outcomes or diagnoses,” Kaffenberger added by email. “It is possible that outcomes may justify the additional costs in this study, for example, if they get the right treatment that works for them and they don’t need return visits.”   To understand differences in costs and drug choices based on physician specialty, researchers examined prescription data for people with Medicare Part D drug benefits in 2008 and 2010. Costs from 2008 were adjusted for inflation to 2010 prices.    The inflation-adjusted total cost of all topical immunomodulators was $232 million in 2008 and $252 million in 2010, researchers report in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.    Overall, the average total cost for a 30-day supply of medicine was $56.20 in 2008 and $51.90 in 2010.   Researchers also analyzed prescriptions from doctors in specialty fields including dermatology, family medicine, internal medicine, psychiatry and neurology.    Regardless of medication potency, prescriptions generally cost more when patients saw dermatologists than when they received care from other physicians, the study found.   For patients, out of pocket cost for a 30-day prescription from a dermatologist was $13 to $14 higher than a prescription from a physician in family or internal medicine and $23 more than one from a specialist in psychiatry or neurology.   In comparison to doctors in family or internal medicine, dermatologists prescribe drugs with a yearly cost of $30 million to $32 million more, and $25 million to $27 million more for prescriptions of similar potency, the authors calculate. This suggests that there’s a potential to save up to about 11 percent on total costs using prescriptions from family and internal medicine doctors, they conclude.    One limitation of the study is that it only includes adults 65 and older, which may mean the findings could be different for topical treatments more commonly prescribed for children, the authors note. The data also didn’t specify that “specialists” were dermatologists, even though that is usually the type of provider who will treat patients with skin problems.    Another challenge in cost comparisons for topical treatments is that people may use different amounts over different surface areas on the body. This means that unlike pills, which can easily be calculated into a daily cost, the amount patients use out of a single tube varies, contributing to differences in cost from one person to the next.   While not all brand-name remedies have generic alternatives on the market, generic topical treatments can work just was well for the vast majority of patients in most clinical situations, said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard University in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Patients should make sure to ask their physicians about whether there is a less expensive generic drug that is indicated for their conditions,” Kesselheim added by email. “Cost-related nonadherence is unfortunately too common among patients, and substitution of an equally effective generic drug for a brand name drug is a simple way to improve patient adherence and clinical outcomes.”  "
2kGY9iU,2017-02-14,Worrying about your grown kids really can keep you up at night," (Reuters Health) - Older married couples can lose sleep when they help support grown kids, but the exact reasons for being awake at night may be different for men and women, a recent study suggests.   Most parents probably don’t need a study to tell them they lose sleep over their kids, but there is plenty of research showing this happens all the time while children are young and living at home. The current study offers fresh insight into how grown kids can still contribute to sleep problems even for empty nesters, said lead study author Amber Seidel of Penn State York in Pennsylvania.    “Family interactions continue to affect us well into later adulthood,” Seidel said by email. “The idea that being an empty nester will eliminate the worries and stresses associated with parenting is a very limited view.”   Sleep problems have been associated with a variety of negative physical and mental health outcomes as well as relationship problems, researchers note in The Gerontologist.   For the current study, they examined data on 186 heterosexual married couples who had two to three adult children, on average.    Husbands were about 58 years old on average, while wives were closer to 57.   Men reported sleeping an average of 6.69 hours a night, while women reported 6.66 hours.    Researchers asked parents how often they provided different types of support to their grown kids including companionship, talking about daily events, emotional support, practical help, advice and financial assistance.    Husbands and wives rated how much they offered support on a scale of 1 to 8, with 1 being daily and 8 being no more than once a year.     How well each parent rated their health and marital satisfaction appeared to influence sleep, the study found.    Neither wives’ or husbands’ support provided to their adult child was associated with how well women slept, the study found.    But for husbands, support the men or their spouses provided to adult kids did impair sleep.    Wives’ stress about supporting their children was associated with their own poorer sleep, but wives didn’t appear to lose sleep due to their husbands’ stress.    Husbands’ sleep wasn’t influenced by their own stress about supporting kids or their wives’ stress about this, the study also found.    One limitation of the study is that it wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether supporting adult children or stressing out about grown kids can directly cause sleep problems, the authors note. It’s also possible that lack of sleep exacerbates stress, rather than stress being responsible for parents getting less rest.    Still, some parents who worry excessively about their adult children might benefit from therapy to improve coping skills or minimize stress, said Dr. Patrick Finan, a researcher in psychiatry and behavioral health at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Stress leads to what we call ‘cognitive narrowing,’ which can be experienced as rumination and rehearsal of negative thoughts,” Finan said by email. “Some people have difficulty disengaging from those thought patterns when it is time to sleep, and this type of excessive worrying intrudes on one’s ability to fall asleep.”   Health problems can follow chronic poor sleep, too.    “When this is experienced chronically and results in chronic sleep loss with associated daytime impairments, insomnia develops,” Finan added. “Unchecked, this type of insomnia is associated with myriad physiological problems, such as hypertension, inflammation, and increased pain sensitivity, as well as mental health problems such as depression and anxiety.”   "
2lC8rou,2017-02-13,"Limit teens’ Saturday-night driving, experts suggest"," (Reuters Health) - Drunk driving contributes to more than one in four motor vehicle fatalities for children, teens and young adults - and nearly half of these deaths happen at night or on weekends, a U.S. study suggests.    “The vast majority of young people who die in alcohol-related crashes are killed on Friday and Saturday evenings,” said lead study author Dr. Scott Hadland of Boston University School of Medicine.    “Parents might consider limiting the extent to which young people drive during late hours on weekends,” Hadland added by email.    Even if youth themselves are not drinking and driving, they are more likely to be killed by adults who have been drinking and driving on weekend evenings, Hadland said.    Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death for children and teens. Laws like zero tolerance for any level of alcohol in the bloodstream or restricted hours for driving or buying liquor have helped curb fatalities, previous research has found.    The current study, which examined the combined impact of multiple policies to reduce drunk driving, found fatalities were much less likely in states with the toughest mix of laws.     Researchers analyzed crashes that occurred from 2000 to 2013 and involved at least one driver with a blood alcohol level of at least 0.08 percent, the legal limit in most states. For a typical adult, drinking more than one beer or glass of wine in an hour will produce a blood alcohol level above this limit.    During the study period, there were 84,756 motor vehicle crash fatalities among people 20 and younger, including 23,757 collisions involving alcohol, researchers report in Pediatrics.    People killed in these crashes were predominantly male (73 percent) and most were at least 18 years old.    Researchers also scored each state on a scale up to 100 points for having the most restrictive legal environment for drunk driving.    Policies received higher points if they were deemed more effective at curbing drunk driving and related fatalities. These included laws restricting hours for alcohol sales or limiting when teens can drive or who can be in the car with them.    Average scores ranged from a low of 24 in Iowa at the start of the study to a high of 75 in Utah near the end of the study period.    Each 10-point increase in this score was associated with 9 percent lower odds of fatalities, the study found.    One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data to assess how well laws were enforced.    Still, the findings suggest that states can help prevent alcohol-related deaths by strengthening policies to deter drunk driving, said Dr. Beth Ebel of the University of Washington and Seattle Children’s Hospital, who wasn’t involved in the study.    Parents, who usually own the car and pay the insurance for teen drivers, have a crucial role to play, too, Ebel added by email.    Review a driving contract with your teen, she suggests: “No seat belt, no car; any drinking, no car.”    “Parents can also set a consistent example with their own behavior,” Ebel said. “Never drive impaired, buckle up, drive courteously, put down your cell phone and use carpool time to catch up with your kid.”   While it’s best to keep young drivers off the road late at night, parents can also teach teens how to spot and avoid erratic drivers who might be drunk, said Russell Griffin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Parents can educate the kids on signs of a driver under the influence such as speed fluctuations, hard braking, and increased lane deviations like swerving between lanes,” Griffin said by email. “By identifying these signs, the young driver can put distance between themselves and the driver under the influence.”  "
2lcTlVw,2017-02-13,Heavy snowfall tied to higher heart attack risk for men," (Reuters Health) - Men may be at increased risk for a fatal heart attack after a major snowstorm hits, a Canadian study suggests.                     A resident shovels snow away from the entrance to his home in Union City, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Midtown Manhattan, after the second-biggest winter storm in New York history, January 24, 2016. REUTERS/Rickey Rogers            Compared with periods without any snow, men were 16 percent more likely to have a heart attack and 34 percent more likely to die from a heart attack after a storm dropped at least 20 centimeters (about 8 inches) of snow, the study found.    Women, however, didn’t appear to have an increased risk of heart attack after a major snowfall.    While previous studies have linked snow shoveling to an increased risk of heart attacks in the days following major storms, the current study offers fresh insight into this connection by examining several decades of health data for individual patients hospitalized in Quebec.    “We found that both the quantity and duration of snowfall were associated with an increased risk of heart attack for men but not women,” said lead study author Dr. Nathalie Auger of the University of Montreal.    It’s not clear from the results why researchers only found an elevated risk for men. But the findings suggest people should be more cautious when shoveling and avoid it whenever possible, especially if they have a history of heart problems, Auger said.    “It may be that men shovel more than women, particularly after heavy snowfalls,” Auger added by email. “It is also possible that men put more effort into shoveling, and have a tendency to overdo it.”    To explore the connections between winter weather and heart attacks, researchers examined data on 128,073 hospital admissions and 68,155 deaths from heart attacks in Quebec between 1981 and 2014.    They focused only on heart attack hospitalizations and deaths from November to April, the months when snowstorms typically hit, and obtained detailed weather data including the amount of snow and duration of storms.    Overall, men accounted for 62 percent of the hospital admissions and 57 percent of deaths, researchers report in CMAJ.    One-third of heart attacks happened the day following snowfall, and about 10 percent happened after at least 5 centimeters (2 inches) hit the ground.    The duration of storms also mattered.   When snowfall continued for at least 24 hours, men were 8 percent more likely to be hospitalized for a heart attack and 12 percent more likely to die than when it didn’t snow, the study found. This didn’t happen for women, however.    Limitations of the study include the lack of data on whether people did in fact shovel snow, or how hard they worked if they did, the authors note. People might not exert themselves as much removing snow with a snow blower as they would shoveling it by hand, the researchers point out.    “We really don’t know for certain whether snow shoveling was the only explanation for their results,” Dr. David Alter of the University of Toronto said by email. “That said, there are studies that have shown mechanistically, how much strain is placed on the heart during snow shoveling.”   Women also shouldn’t assume from these results that they wouldn’t boost their risk of a heart attack by overexertion while shoveling snow, added Alter, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.    “The risks do not only extend to men,” Alter said. “If you are sedentary, not participating in regular exercise, and over the age of 50 with risk factors for heart disease or with established heart disease, I would not recommend snow shoveling.”   If it’s unavoidable, Alter recommends bundling up to keep warm and using a snow blower if possible or using a shovel to push snow aside rather than to heave it up and toss it into a pile.    “Don’t lift the snow,” Alter added. “If you want to reduce your risk with snow shoveling, exercise regularly for 30 to 45 minutes five days per week to make certain you are appropriately physically conditioned to do so.”  "
2j6YCNv,2017-02-10,Salt reduction policies cost-effective even without healthcare savings," (Reuters Health) - Government policies designed to reduce how much salt people eat may be cost-effective even without considering the potential healthcare savings, a recent study suggests.    That’s because efforts to curb salt use through policies like public education and industry agreements would not cost that much relative to their potential to reduce mortality and disability, researchers estimate.    “We know that too much salt in the diet causes hundreds of thousands of preventable cardiovascular deaths a year,” said senior study author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston.   “The trillion dollar questions are how to start to bring salt down, and how much would such an effort cost,” Mozaffarian added by email.    Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, killing almost one in every three people. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease in general, and heart attack and stroke in particular.   Reducing sodium intake can significantly lower blood pressure in adults, in turn helping to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease. Sodium is found not only in table salt, but in a variety of foods such as bread, milk, eggs, meat, and shellfish as well as processed items like pretzels, popcorn, soy sauce and bouillon or stock cubes.    To lower the risk of heart disease, adults should reduce sodium intake to less than 2 grams a day, or the equivalent of about one teaspoon of salt, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).   For the current study, researchers modeled the effects and costs of government-supported sodium reduction programs in 183 countries worldwide.    Researchers used data from 2010 to analyze sodium intake, blood pressure levels, the effects of sodium on blood pressure, the effects of blood pressure on cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular disease rates.    Then, they examined costs of sodium reduction programs using a tool from the World Health Organization for examining efforts to prevent non-communicable diseases. This tool accounts for costs of things like human resources, training, meetings, supplies, equipment and mass media.    Government programs designed to achieve a 10 percent reduction in salt consumption over 10 years could save nearly 6 million life years currently lost to cardiovascular disease each year, at an average cost of $204 per life year saved, researchers report in The BMJ.    The overall effectiveness of the intervention was based on recent efforts in the UK and Turkey, which showed that such a government-supported program could reduce salt consumption by at least 10 percent over a decade.    A gradual reduction of salt intake by 10 percent over 10 years could save an average of 5.8 million disability-adjusted life years (DALY) each year that would otherwise be lost to cardiovascular disease.    Of these, about 42 percent were attributable to coronary heart disease, 40 percent to stroke and 18 percent to other types of cardiovascular disease, researchers calculated.    One limitation of the study is that researchers used raw data from 2010 covering a majority but not all of the global population, the authors note. Estimated health benefits only considered cardiovascular disease and not other medical problems that may be prevented with salt reduction, the researchers also point out.     The projected savings are conservative, however, because they don’t include savings based on people who might not require treatment for heart disease due to reduced salt intake.    Even when government policies don’t encourage food manufacturers to reduce sodium in processed foods, consumers can still take steps to reduce salt consumption, said Dr. Margo Denke a former professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School who now works in private practice in Bandera, Texas.    “We do have and can make better choices,” Denke, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “We have available lower fat canned goods in many categories like canned beans and canned tomatoes that contain no sodium, lower sodium luncheon meats, lower sodium bread, lower sodium chips, lower sodium soups, and other food categories will occur once demand for these products takes off,” Denke added.    “Be a label reader and vote with your grocery cart,” Denke said.

2kQvSHo,2017-02-10,"Later high school start times linked to higher attendance, graduation rates"," (Reuters Health) - When high schools start at 8:30 a.m. or later, attendance rates and graduation rates improve, according to a new study.   The study backs previous research that says additional sleep boosts psychological, behavioral and academic benefits for teens.   “So much research explains the impact of insufficient sleep on suicide, substance abuse, depression, auto accidents and more,” said lead study author Pamela McKeever of Central Connecticut State University in New Britain.   “This connects the dots between the world of science and education,” she told Reuters Health. “Through this, educators and parents can see how lack of sleep impacts the school indicators that we use to measure student success.”    McKeever and colleague Linda Clark looked at school start times, graduation rates and attendance rates for 30,000 students in 29 high schools across seven states. They found that two years after a delayed start was implemented at these high schools, average attendance rates and graduation rates had increased several percentage points.   For example, the average graduation completion rate was 79 percent before the delayed start was implemented, and it was 88 percent afterward.   “This doesn’t only impact our high school students. This impacts all of society,” McKeever said. “As graduation rates improve, young adults experience less hardship after graduation, a lower chance of incarceration and a higher chance of career success.”   Delayed bell times could close the achievement gap as well, McKeever and Clark wrote in Sleep Health, the journal of the National Sleep Foundation. When schools start later, students in lower socioeconomic categories are more likely to get to the bus on time. When they arrive at school on time, they’re more likely to stay in class and graduate.    “When kids miss a bus early in the morning and that’s their only form of transportation, they miss class and then soon the credits,” said Kyla Wahlstrom of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, who wasn’t involved with this study. “People don’t understand the link between early wakeup times and graduation rates, but it’s that direct.”   Since the late 1990s, Wahlstrom and other researchers have suggested that delayed high school start times may help students. In 2014, she and her colleagues reported that in a three-year study with 9,000 students in eight public high schools across three states, attendance rates increased with a start time of 8:35 a.m. or later.    In December, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine advised that later school start times could improve sleep, reduce car accidents and reduce sleepiness. The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends 8:30 a.m. as the earliest time to begin school.   But school policies have yet to change nationwide. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that in 42 states, 75-100 percent of public schools start before 8:30 a.m.    Teens are “driven by biology to go to sleep later, and there’s not much we can do about that, but school start times are the main reason they get up when they do,” said Anne Wheaton, an epidemiologist at the CDC in Atlanta, in email to Reuters Health. Wheaton wasn’t involved with this study.    A limitation of the study is that many variables affect attendance and graduation rates. Changes at the school level, such as different teachers, policies and the surrounding community itself, could affect students and their ability to complete class credits, extracurricular activities and afterschool jobs. Also, the data didn’t measure sleep time or indicate whether students slept more due to delayed start times.   “The debate about school start time and adolescent sleep patterns has been going on for a number of years,” said Mary Carskadon of the Sleep for Science Research Lab at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who wasn’t involved with this study.    “Efforts to delay the school bell are more likely to succeed best when parents and the teens themselves use better choices,” she told Reuters Health by email. “This includes having a set bedtime and limiting arousing activities in the evening.”  "
2lsRcG4,2017-02-10,Drowsy drivers often behind fatal crashes," (Reuters Health) - In the U.S. alone, more than 6,000 people die in drowsy driving-related motor vehicle crashes each year, a recent study suggests.    Millions of U.S. drivers fall asleep at the wheel each month, and roughly 15 percent of all fatal crashes involve a drowsy driver, researchers note in the journal Sleep.    “Drowsy driving is not just falling asleep at the wheel; it mimics alcohol-impaired driving in many ways,” said lead study author Stephen Higgins, a researcher at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in Washington, D.C.   “Drowsiness leads to slower reaction times and impaired attention, mental processing, judgment, and decision making,” Higgins added by email.    Getting enough sleep every night is the best defense against drowsy driving, Higgins and colleagues note.    When that’s not possible, a nap to break up the road trip may still help drivers remain more alert behind the wheel.    “If you start to get sleepy while you’re driving, pull over for a short 20 to 30 minute nap in a safe place, such as a lighted designated rest stop,” Higgins said. “You can also combine a caffeinated drink with the nap - this has been shown to increase alertness in scientific studies but only for short time periods.”   For the study, Higgins and colleagues examined data from previously published research on drowsy driving to identify the main causes of the problem and potential ways to prevent it.    Many lifestyle factors can influence the odds of drowsy driving, they note. These include working long and irregular hours, working night shifts and having multiple jobs.   In addition, people who tend to frequently visit nightclubs or who are thrill-seekers also are more likely to be drowsy drivers.    People who don’t fit the profile of a typical drowsy driver can still be at increased risk for nodding off behind the wheel at some point due to life events, the authors also note. For example, people who don’t get enough rest the night before embarking on a long family road trip might be drowsy drivers.    To calculate the toll of drowsy driving, researchers examined crash data from 2010.    They found 32,999 total fatal crashes and 3.9 million total injury crashes.    Drowsy driving accounted for about 5,445 fatal crashes and 510,900 non-fatal collisions, for a total estimated societal cost of $109 billion per year, based on the 2010 figures.   Too often, people drive when they’re tired because they have no choice, said Russell Griffin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the study.   “It would be great if everyone had the ability to carpool or to had access to public transportation, but without these options all they can do is drive themselves regardless of how tired they may be,” Griffin said by email.    “Another reason people drive while tired is that they underestimate the risks of driving drowsy,” Griffin added. “If we are able to educate the public of the dangers of drowsy driving, this may drive people to either find alternate modes of transportation when tired or plan ahead when they know that they will have to be driving while tired (e.g., driving home from work).”   While insufficient sleep is most often the cause of drowsy driving, other health issues can sometimes contribute to the problem, said Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Sometimes drowsy driving is caused by a medical disorder such as sleep apnea, narcolepsy or a drug side effect,” Redelmeier said by email.    Beyond taking precautions to remain awake and alert behind the wheel, drivers should also keep other common-sense safety measures in mind.   “Being drowsy is one of many factors that can lead to driver error and a life-threatening traffic crash,” Redelmeier said. “At a minimum, be sure to buckle your seatbelt, respect the speed limit, avoid using cell phones, signal your turn, yield right-of-way, and do not drink and drive.”  "
2kMb0kD,2017-02-10,Kids who live with e-cigarette users may think smoking is okay," (Reuters Health) – Kids who don’t smoke but are around adults who use electronic cigarettes may start to think regular smoking is okay, a recent study suggests.   Tobacco smoking among U.S. youth has fallen since 1998, but some experts worry that acceptance of e-cigarettes may promote acceptance of traditional cigarettes and reverse the trend, the study team writes in Journal of Adolescent Health.    “The public health community has worked very hard to educate the population about the harm of smoking, and we have observed a shift in acceptability of cigarette smoking, which, in part, led to the decline in the prevalence of smoking,” lead study author Kelvin Choi told Reuters Health.   “E-cigarettes may reverse what has been accomplished, but there was a lack of data to support or refute this issue. That’s why we conducted the study to get an answer that can inform the discussion,” said Choi, a researcher at the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities in Bethesda Maryland    “Our findings show that e-cigarette use by youth who never smoked cigarettes is associated with seeing adult smoking as acceptable, which in turn is associated with openness to try cigarette smoking,” Choi said.   The study findings help explain how e-cigarette use may lead to cigarette smoking later, he added.   To test the idea, Choi and colleagues analyzed data from the 2014 Florida Youth Tobacco Survey, which was answered by almost 70,000 middle school and high school students in 765 Florida schools.     Students were asked if they had ever smoked or used e-cigarettes or if they had seen or heard commercials about the devices. In addition, they were asked if they lived with anyone who used e-cigarettes.    The kids were also asked whether their friends and community members viewed adult cigarette smoking as acceptable.    About 20 percent of high school students and roughly 8 percent of middle schoolers had tried e-cigarettes. Almost 13 percent of high schoolers and 12 percent of middle schoolers lived with e-cigarette users.    The study team found that students who had never smoked had a positive view of adult smoking if they were exposed to electronic cigarette use at home or in advertisements or if their friends and community members accept regular cigarette use by adults.    “Living with someone who uses e-cigarettes, and seeing e-cigarette advertisement, are also associated with seeing adult smoking as acceptable and also openness to try cigarette smoking, regardless of e-cigarette use experience. This may suggest that e-cigarettes can influence youth cigarette smoking without them trying e-cigarettes,” Choi said.   The study is limited because it only looked at one state and one point in time, Choi noted. “The next steps will be to examine if our findings are true nationally, and also the confirm our findings with longitudinal studies,” he said.   Future research is also needed to evaluate if including e-cigarettes in current clean indoor air policies, upholding high e-cigarette prices and regulating e-cigarette advertising would lower youth exposure to e-cigarettes, and in turn, lower youth acceptability of adult smoking at the population level, Choi said.   “We have known for a long time that exposure to smoking - such as seeing people smoke in real life or in advertising or movies – increases the chances that youth will also try smoking,” said Lucy Popova, a researcher at the Georgia State University School of Public Health in Atlanta who was not involved in the study.        Exposure to e-cigarettes may have a similar effect on openness to try smoking, she told Reuters Health by email.   “When kids think that something is normal or acceptable, they are more likely to try it. This study found that exposure to electronic cigarettes makes smoking to be perceived as normal, which makes children more likely to give it a try and start down the road to lifelong addiction,” Popova said.   Parents, teachers, and other adults who are concerned about children starting to smoke should lead by example, she added.   “Institute smoke-free rules in your home – don’t smoke or use any tobacco inside your house or car and don’t let others use it. If you are smoking – quit. If you are using e-cigarettes, quit them as well,” Popova said.  "
2lutMN9,2017-02-10,Few transgender teens opt for fertility preservation," (Reuters Health) – Just a fraction of transgender adolescents who are counseled about infertility risks associated with their treatment will opt to bank their sperm or eggs, new research shows.   “More research needs to be done to understand parenthood goals and barriers to fertility-preservation utilization specific to this transgender population,” said lead author Dr. Leena Nahata, of Nationwide Children’s Hospital and The Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus.    Most research to date on fertility preservation has focused on young patients undergoing cancer treatment, Nahata told Reuters Health by phone. However, she and her colleagues point out in the Journal of Adolescent Medicine, there are many other medical situations where a discussion of fertility preservation could be warranted, including for transgender individuals undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy.    Current guidelines and ethics committee statements recommend that transgender patients receive fertility counseling and be offered fertility preservation before they begin hormone treatment. They also recognize that transgender individuals may have the same desire for biological children as other populations, Nahata noted.   The researchers studied 73 adolescent patients treated at their center (50 transgender males and 23 transgender females). All but one received fertility counseling, but only two - both transgender females - opted for fertility preservation.   About three-quarters of the study participants had a documented reason for refusing fertility preservation, with 45 percent saying that they were considering or planning to adopt, 22 percent saying they never want to have children, and 8 percent saying they thought fertility preservation would be too expensive.   By comparison, the authors note, about 25 percent of pubertal males diagnosed with cancer will bank their sperm, while pubertal females may be less likely to choose fertility preservation.   “Our findings suggest that parenthood goals among transgender individuals may not be the same as they are in other populations,” Nahata noted.    Unease or dissatisfaction about one’s body, urgency to start treatments, developmental factors and mental health concerns could also make these patients less likely to use fertility preservation, she and her colleagues note.   “Many of the adolescents in this study said ‘I don’t ever want to have kids,’ or ‘I want to adopt,’ and we don’t know if that attitude persists into adulthood for these kids,” Nahata said. “We intend to pursue prospective work in those areas to examine if and how parenting goals may change over time, and what the perceived benefits and barriers to fertility preservation are in this population at different ages and developmental stages.”  "
2lpis8p,2017-02-09,Eating during labor may be safe - even beneficial - for women," (Reuters Health) - Women may be able to eat more than just ice chips during labor without risking complications, according to a new review of previous research.   In fact, women who were allowed to eat before delivery had a slightly shorter labor than those who were restricted to ice chips or sips of water - although the study can’t prove that eating caused deliveries to happen sooner.   “We really don’t know how much if anything people can eat or drink in labor,” said senior author Dr. Vincenzo Berghella, of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.   Whether women can have more than water or ice chips as they labor to give birth is a common discussion among healthcare providers, he told Reuters Health.   Concerns go back decades, to a 1940s study in which women who delivered under general anesthesia were at risk of inhaling their stomach contents and choking in it, Berghella and colleagues write in Obstetrics and Gynecology.   The use of general anesthesia during delivery is far less common today, but guidelines still recommend against eating solid food during labor, they add.   For the new study, the researchers compiled data from randomized controlled trials that compared the labor outcomes of women who were allowed to eat only ice chips or water and those who were allowed to eat or drink a bit more.   For example, one study allowed women to drink a honey and date syrup. Another study allowed all types of food and drinks. A few others allowed women to drink liquids with carbohydrates.   Overall, the researchers analyzed 10 trials that included 3,982 women in labor. All were only delivering one child - not twins or triplets - and were not at risk for cesarean delivery.   The women with the less restrictive diets were not at increased risk for other complications, including vomiting or choking, during the use of general anesthesia.   And women who were allowed to eat and drink more than the traditional ice chips and water had labors that were shorter, by an average of 16 minutes, compared to women with the more restrictive diets.   “If we’re well hydrated and have adequate carbohydrate in our body, our muscles work better,” said Berghella. A woman’s uterus is largely made of muscle.   The finding is reinforced by another of his studies, which found women who received more fluid than normal delivered faster than other women.   Berghella said it’s still common practice for women with uncomplicated births to be restricted to water or ice chips during labor.   “The evidence from well-done studies is they can have more than that,” he said.

2kLmR2s,2017-02-09,"False alarms delay future mammograms, linked to later diagnosis"," (Reuters Health) - Women who are told that their suspicious mammogram was a false alarm are more likely to delay their next scheduled mammogram, or possibly not show up for their next screening at all.   The finding, in a study of 261,767 Chicago-area women in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, highlights an unintended consequence of such false alarms, known as false positives.   In cases where a mammogram was recommended every year, women who had an unfounded scare tended to delay their next test by an additional 13 months compared to a three- to six-month delay for women whose tests had come out negative.   That, in turn, can affect a woman’s chances of survival if breast cancer is subsequently diagnosed.   Among women who had not experienced a false alarm, their odds of being diagnosed with an advanced tumor were 0.3 percent. The odds for a woman who had experienced a false alarm were slightly but significantly higher at 0.4 percent.   Some women never showed up at all, but the researchers couldn’t determine whether they gave up on the breast cancer screening or simply had it done elsewhere.   “It’s a delicate balance,” chief author Firas Dabbous of Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, Illinois, told Reuters Health. “We want to detect tumors when they are present but we don’t want to overburden women with a lot of false positives and a workup that is not needed.”   Debates over how often women should get mammograms often focus on whether false positives - which can cause women to experience anxiety as well as painful and expensive extra testing, including biopsies – represent a harm that outweighs the benefits of screening.   “The delays the authors observed were significant,” Robert Smith, vice president for cancer screening at the American Cancer Society, told Reuters Health by email. “If these findings can be validated in other studies, then it suggests that extra attention should be dedicated to insuring that women with false positive findings are reminded to return to annual or biennial screening with sufficient notice and multiple reminders.”   Being told that a breast X-ray has uncovered something suspicious is always stressful, even though most women are also told that, in the vast majority of cases, there is no problem.   Women who have a mammogram have a chance as high as 1 in 10 of getting a false positive. In fact, a woman who has an annual mammogram has a 50-50 chance of having one false positive every decade. An estimated 7 percent to 17 percent of those will require a biopsy.   Previous studies that have tried to assess how false positives affect the willingness to have a future mammogram have produced mixed results.   “Most U.S. studies have shown either greater adherence to screening recommendations after a false positive, or no difference, whereas studies done in Europe have shown screening rates somewhat lower than women who have true negative results,” Smith said.   The Dabbous team looked at 741,150 screening mammograms done at a large healthcare organization.   In 12.3 percent of the cases, there was something suspicious but it turned out to be a false alarm.   During the three years after that initial mammogram, 77.9 percent of the women with a false positive result had a subsequent mammogram compared to 85.0 percent of the women who had not experienced a false alarm.   Biopsies seemed to play a significant role in whether a woman came back for another mammogram. Compared to patients who had received a false positive and simply received additional imaging, women who also got a biopsy were 19 percent less likely to come back for a regular mammogram.    It’s not known if the false positive experience prompted some women to give up on mammograms, said Dabbous, who is manager of patient centered outcomes research at Advocate’s Russell Institute for Research and Innovation.   The lesson for women remains “to encourage women to adhere to mammography screening and come back on time because this is the only tool that we have that is literally working,” Dabbous said. “Yes, it has some limitations. But it’s increasing the survivability of the woman through early detection.”  "
2kvPClc,2017-02-09,Few poor or minority patients in New York City’s academic hospitals," (Reuters Health) - Black patients are half as likely as white patients to get care at academic medical centers in New York City even after accounting for differences in health insurance, a recent study suggests.    Compared to privately insured patients, people with coverage through Medicaid, the government health program for the poor, are three times less likely to receive treatment at these elite New York hospitals, the study also found. Uninsured patients are five times less likely to get care at academic hospitals.    “Academic medical centers are generally better able to provide highly specialized care for patients with complex or rare illnesses,” said lead study author Roosa Sofia Tikkanen, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester who completed the work while at City University of New York School of Public Health at Hunter College.   “Most experts believe unequal access to high-quality health care contributes to disparities in health outcomes,” Tikkanen added by email. “In New York City, life expectancy can differ by up to 10 years between two neighborhoods that are located just six subway stops apart.”   About 18 percent of patients at academic medical centers are black, compared with almost one-third at other hospitals in the city, the analysis of discharge data from 2009 and 2014 found.    At the same time, 22 percent of patients were insured by Medicaid at academic hospitals, compared with 42 percent at other hospitals in the city. And only 1 percent of academic hospital patients were uninsured, compared with 4 percent elsewhere.    While Medicaid and uninsured patients accounted for nearly half of all patients at non-academic hospitals in the city, they made up less than one-quarter of inpatients at academic medical centers. At one-third of academic hospitals, less than 10 percent of patients had Medicaid or were uninsured.    To see how race, ethnicity and payer status affect the likelihood of being treated at an academic medical center, researchers analyzed data on adults discharged from hospitals in New York City in 2009 and 2014, and they also looked at similar data for Boston hospitals in 2009.    In Boston, uninsured and Medicaid patients were just as likely to be treated at academic medical centers as at other hospitals. And racial and ethnic minorities were slightly overrepresented at academic hospitals.    It’s possible some of the differences between the two cities might be explained by the extensive public hospital network in New York, the authors note in the International Journal of Health Services.    All of the academic medical centers in Boston and New York are nonprofit hospitals, however, and enjoy tax exemptions worth tens of millions of dollars, the researchers point out. In exchange, they are expected to provide community benefits, including caring for Medicaid and uninsured patients.   One limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t account for patients’ diagnoses or severity of illnesses, which could influence which hospital they went to for care, the authors add. The analysis of two cities also might not reflect what happens in other communities.    The study also didn’t examine the role of residential segregation or neighborhood poverty on use of academic medical centers, noted Asal Mohamadi Johnson, a public health researcher at Stetson University in Florida who wasn’t involved in the study.    “The issue of equity and fairness is at stake here,” Johnson said by email. “Academic medical centers should be held to higher levels of ethical standards in providing care for low income and minority patients.”   When there are disparities in patients’ access to care, academic medical centers may not offer the best possible education to new doctors, Johnson added.    “Active participation of academic medical centers in caring for non-whites and the poor prepares a more qualified and culturally competent generation of physicians and health care providers who will have more familiarity with the unique circumstances and barriers confronting these patients,” Johnson said.

2k4hbTV,2017-02-08,Dietary protein - from any source - may help muscle health," (Reuters Health) - Diets high in protein from any source - animals or plants - may help keep muscles big and strong as people age, according to a new study.   People with higher overall protein intake had higher muscle mass and stronger quadriceps, the muscle in front of the thigh, said lead author Kelsey Mangano of the University of Massachusetts in Lowell.   Proteins are found in meat, fish, poultry, eggs, dairy, vegetables, grains and nuts. The Institute of Medicine recommends adults get about 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. That translates to about 56 grams (about 2 ounces) per day for a sedentary person who weighs 70 kg (about 154 pounds).   Protein is known to protect bone density, muscle mass and strength, but it’s been unclear whether the protein must come from specific food sources, the researchers write in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.   For example, do people who get their proteins from meat benefit more than people who get their proteins from non-animal food sources, or vice versa.   The researchers used data from 2,986 men and women, ages 19 to 72, who filled out questionnaires about their diets between 2002 and 2005.    Overall, about 82 percent of participants were getting the recommended daily amount of protein. Their diets fell into one of six patterns: fast food and full fat dairy, fish, red meat, chicken, low fat milk, and legumes.   The researchers then looked to see if the participants’ dietary patterns were tied to their muscle mass, muscle strength and bone density.   Unlike past studies, the researchers found no links between dietary protein consumption and bone density, although they did find that dietary protein was tied to muscle mass and strength.   Muscle mass and strength were higher among people who consumed the most protein, compared to those who consumed the least.   People with the highest amounts of protein in their diets were eating about 1.8 grams per kilogram of body weight per day (or about 0.03 ounces per pound of body weight), compared to 0.8 grams per kilogram (about 0.01 ounces per pound) among those eating the least.   The results did not change based on people’s dietary patterns. A person getting a large amount of protein from red meat was benefiting as much as a person getting it from legumes.   “High protein diets do benefit most individuals,” said Mangano, who did the research while at Hebrew SeniorLife’s Institute for Aging Research. “It can be beneficial to maintaining muscle mass and strength – particularly as we age.”   She told Reuters Health it’s a positive message that people with dietary restrictions may still benefit from higher protein diets but cautioned the results are only one study with a group of mostly white participants.   Another study of older participants may help confirm whether the source of protein matters later in life, Mangano said. Her team previously looked at bone density in older adults and found that “people who were consuming most of their protein from red meat and processed meat had the lowest bone mineral density than other groups,” she said.

2krWCPY,2017-02-08,Sex education for teen boys linked to higher dual contraceptive use," (Reuters Health) - Young men who receive sex education before age 18 are more likely to use more than one type of contraceptive method during sex, such as a condom in addition to their female partner’s hormonal birth control, according to a small U.S. study.   “The dual method significantly decreases the chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or having an unplanned pregnancy,” said lead author Nicole Jaramillo, a public health researcher at San Diego State University in California.    “This is especially important among adolescent males with the growing use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods among their female partners,” she told Reuters Health. “It is still very important to promote and educate about the use of condoms for STI prevention.”   Jaramillo and colleagues looked at data from 539 heterosexual men, 15 to 20 years old, who answered the 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth and reported being sexually active. The survey asked whether they had received sex education about seven topics: STIs, HIV/AIDS, how to say no to sex, birth control methods, where to get birth control, how to use a condom, and abstinence, or waiting until marriage to have sex.    The survey also asked about contraceptive use during their last sexual intercourse, including whether they had relied only on female-controlled methods such as the pill or LARC, only on male-controlled methods such as vasectomy or condoms, had used a combination of contraceptive methods, or used no method.   Almost all of the men - 99 percent - said they had received sex education on at least one topic, and 19 percent said they had learned about all seven. Most learned about STIs (95 percent) and HIV/AIDS (92 percent). The least commonly taught topic was where to find birth control, with less than 42 percent of young men saying they had received instruction.     Most of the men, 91 percent, reported using a form of contraception. Condoms alone were used by almost 44 percent, almost 9 percent had relied on female-only methods and 39 percent used dual methods.    Having learned about birth control methods and how to say no to sex were associated with dual contraception use. With each additional sex education topic a young man had been exposed to, his odds of using dual methods increased by 47 percent, researchers found.   “This study allowed us to look at the different topics of sex education rather than grouping the topics as ‘abstinence only’ versus ‘comprehensive’ sex education,” Jaramillo said. “Sex education that focuses on a broad range of topics is the most effective form of sex education.”   In the United States, STI rates have increased in recent years, Jaramillo added. In 2013, about 20 million people contracted an STI, about half of the cases among ages 15 to 24, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In addition, chlamydia, gonorrhea and primary and secondary syphilis cases rose to an all-time high in 2015, the authors write in Journal of Adolescent Health.   U.S. rates of STIs and unintended pregnancies are among the highest in industrialized countries, the study team notes. However, U.S. teen birth rates have dropped to an all-time low of 24 births per 1,000 women between ages 15-19, according to CDC data.   “We know young men play a key role in making decisions about contraceptives, but not many reproductive health programs target them,” said Jennifer Manlove, a reproductive health researcher at Child Trends in Bethesda, Maryland, who was not involved in the study.   “We know from other research that high-quality programs are engaging, interactive and targeted toward the population,” she told Reuters Health. “Programs should highlight men’s role in contraception.”  "
2loX5jo,2017-02-08,Preteens who mistrust teachers less likely to reach college," (Reuters Health) - Students of color who perceive biased treatment from middle school teachers may be less likely to attend college than if they trusted instructors to treat them fairly, a small study suggests.    “We don’t think the discrimination and bias, by itself, had this effect,” said lead study author David Yeager, a psychology researcher at the University of Texas at Austin and co-chair of the Mindset Scholars Network at Stanford University in California.    “Instead, we think these experiences made students disengage from the system,” Yeager added by email. “Once you’re disengaged, you do worse, you get lower grades, you’re more likely to get in trouble, and so on, and once kids have low grades or high absences, they’re just less likely to go on and get higher SAT scores and eventually make it to college.”   In a time of increased concern about how minorities are treated by police, teachers and other authorities, it is critical to examine whether students of color have experiences in school that lead to mistrust of authorities and what the long-term implications are for young people, Yeager and colleagues write in the journal Child Development.   Minority youth perceived and experienced more biased treatment and lost more trust over the middle school years than their white peers, researchers found. Minority students’ growing lack of trust in turn predicted whether they acted out in school and whether they made it to college years later.    The analysis included 277 black and white students at one school in the northeast U.S. and a second group of 206 white and Latino students from Colorado. The first group was followed though college entry, but the second group was not.    Researchers assessed trust by asking the students to complete surveys that featured questions like “I am treated fairly by teachers and other adults at my school” and “If a black or white student is alone in the hallway during class time, which one would a teacher ask for a hall pass?”    With the first group, black students reported more bias in school discipline decisions, and school records in fact showed that only minorities were disciplined for “defiance” and “disobedience.”    As middle school progressed, black students became more aware of this bias and less trustful of school authorities, the study found. Even students who never had discipline issues before became more likely to experience these problems once they lost trust in teachers and other school authorities.    Researchers found a similar pattern among the Latino and white students in the second group, with distrust increasing for students of color as middle school progressed.    Within the first group of kids, however, researchers tested a pilot project that randomly selected 88 seventh grade social studies students to be singled out for special encouragement. These kids got a hand-written note on an essay encouraging them to meet a higher standard and implying the teacher believed they had the ability to do this.    This note made no difference for white students. But black students who received the note had fewer disciplinary incidents and were more likely to be enrolled in college six years later.    While the study is small, and a one-time note for a few kids doesn’t prove what interventions can improve college attendance among students of color, the findings suggest it’s possible to create an environment of trust even for students who contend with discrimination, the authors conclude.    “It is highly likely that students of color experience injustice based on race in the community as well as in school,” said Dr. Caroline Kistin, a pediatrics researcher at Boston University School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study.    “In some ways, this makes the intervention in school even more important,” Kistin added by email. “It might help to buffer the discrimination that students face elsewhere.”  "
2kILa11,2017-02-08,Mothers of preemies face increased heart disease risk," (Reuters Health) - Women who have premature babies are more likely than other mothers to develop heart disease later in life, even if they didn’t have any risk factors for cardiovascular problems before pregnancy, a recent study suggests.    Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born after 37 weeks are considered full term.   Compared to women who delivered their first babies after 37 weeks, first-time mothers of infants born earlier are 40 percent more likely to develop heart disease, the study found. With extremely preterm infants born before 32 weeks, first-time mothers had twice the later heart risk.    No more than 21 percent of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease for mothers of preemies could be explained by weight gain, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or diabetes that women developed after they had their first baby, researchers report in the journal Circulation.     The rest is unexplained and requires more research, but suggests that preterm delivery should be added to the list of women’s risk factors for future heart disease, the study team writes.    “Women who deliver a preterm infant have an early warning signal for their future cardiovascular health,” said lead study author Lauren Tanz of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.    “They may want to take special care with their hearts by adopting a heart healthy diet and lifestyle, including maintaining a healthy body weight, exercising, and not smoking,” Tanz added by email.    For the study, researchers examined data on more than 70,000 U.S. mothers, following half of them for at least 32 years.    The data was collected starting in 1989 as part of a long-term health study of nurses that included periodic surveys on medical conditions, diet, exercise, smoking, medication use and reproductive history.    Overall, almost 9 percent of the women delivered preterm babies in their first pregnancy. Roughly 2 percent delivered very preterm, or before 32 weeks, while about 7 percent delivered during weeks 32 to 36 of pregnancy.    Women who had preemies were more likely to be overweight or obese, have high blood pressure or high cholesterol or a family history of cardiovascular disease before they gave birth.    During the study, researchers observed 949 heart attacks and 455 strokes.    The increased risk seen among mothers of preemies translates to higher likelihoods of dying from one of those events, the researchers calculate. While 31 percent of women in general will die from cardiovascular disease, that figure rises to 36 percent for those who deliver three to seven weeks early and up to 60 percent for women who deliver eight or more weeks too soon.   Limitations of the study include the reliance on women to accurately recall and report how long pregnancy lasted and the lack of data to explore differences between spontaneous versus induced preterm deliveries, the authors note.    Still, the study is the largest to date to establish a link between preterm delivery and a future risk of heart disease for women, said Dr. Wayne Franklin of the Texas Children’s Hospital and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.   “We think that pregnancy acts as a stress that worsens a woman’s cardiovascular disease risk,” Franklin, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   Causes of premature birth like infection and inflammation are also well-known risk factors for hardening of the arteries, blood vessel dysfunction and rupturing of fatty plaques inside arteries, Franklin said.    “Early delivery itself does necessarily lead to the increased cardiovascular risk, but the process that leads to the early delivery is the same process that leads to heart attacks and strokes - and that’s the culprit,” Franklin added.    Mothers of preemies - especially before 32 weeks - should have heart health checkups at least once a year and try to minimize their risk of cardiovascular disease by keeping blood pressure, cholesterol levels and blood sugar within a healthy rage, said Kaberi Dasgupta of McGill University in Montreal.    “These are the things we can do something about, even if they may not fully explain the relationship between preterm delivery and heart disease and stroke later in life,” Dasgupta, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.

2kihPJM,2017-02-07,Adults urged to get vaccinated," (Reuters Health) - Too many U.S. adults are not getting vaccinated, putting themselves and others at risk, immunization experts say.                     A nurse displays a tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis whooping cough vaccine at a free medical and dental health clinic in Los Angeles, California, U.S., April 27, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson       According to the latest available data, about 44 percent of adults over age 19 had a flu shot; 20 percent had a Tdap vaccine, which protects against tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis; and 20 percent of 19-to-64-year-olds at risk of pneumonia had that vaccine (compared to 60 percent of those over 65).    Just 27 percent of those over age 60 were vaccinated against herpes zoster, which cuts the risk of shingles in half, according to new guidelines from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) published in Annals of Internal Medicine.   “Vaccinations not only protect you. They also protect those around you,” ACIP liaison Dr. Sandra Fryhofer said by email, yet, “vaccination coverage rates for adults are abysmal.”   Fryhofer, an Atlanta physician and adjunct associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine, also pointed to racial and ethnic disparities in vaccination rates, with whites more likely than all other groups to be vaccinated. And she noted that adults with health insurance are two to five times more likely to be appropriately vaccinated.    “It’s a double whammy for those without insurance. They don’t have insurance coverage if they get sick and they don’t have insurance coverage to pay for vaccinations that can help them stay well,” said Fryhofer, who was also a member of the working group that came up with the new guidelines.   Dr. Walter Orenstein, associate director of the Emory Vaccine Center in Atlanta, called adult vaccine uptake “disappointing” and said it is substantially below the rates achieved for most recommended vaccines for young children.   “All adults should be vaccinated against influenza annually, receive a booster of a tetanus vaccine every 10 years, two different types of pneumococcal vaccine when they turn 65, and a vaccine to prevent shingles when they reach age 60,” Orenstein said by email.     If you weren’t vaccinated as a child, you may need additional vaccines, added Orenstein, who was not involved in the guidelines. “All pregnant women should receive influenza vaccine, which protects them and their newborns, as well as a dose of a vaccine that protects their newborns against whooping cough,” he said.    Some of the  important changes made in the 2017 guidelines, according to Fryhofer and Orenstein, include the recommendation that everyone aged 6 months and older should still be vaccinated against flu, even this late in the season, but should not use the nasal vaccine, which has been found not to work very well.   Another new guidance says that young people vaccinated against human papilloma virus (HPV) before age 15 need only two vaccine doses, not three, given at least five months apart. If you’re 15 or older and haven’t been vaccinated before, you still need three doses.    People with liver disease should get the hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects against liver cancer. And those with HIV need two doses of a meningococcal vaccine, and doctors should use the same vaccine for all doses.    How well an individual responds to a vaccine - whether or not it works - depends on the health of their immune system, Fryhofer said. “The very young, the old, or anyone with a weakened immune system - including pregnant women - don’t respond as well,” she noted.    “Healthy people are more likely to make the most protective antibodies, and that’s another reason why it’s important for them to get vaccinated. They need to stay protected so they won’t spread infection to others who are not so healthy and could die if they get sick,” she added.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Vaccinations for Adults web page ( bit.ly/2fzDu1A ) can help you determine which vaccines you need, Orenstein said.   "
2kG191X,2017-02-06,Many teens use e-cigarettes for &#039;dripping&#039; liquid nicotine," (Reuters Health) - One in four teens who use electronic cigarettes have tried “dripping” liquid nicotine directly onto the heating coils on the devices to get thicker clouds of vapor, a new study suggests.                     An exhibitor staff member uses an electronic cigarette at Beijing International Vapor Distribution Alliance Expo (VAPE CHINA EXPO) in Beijing, July 24, 2015. REUTERS/Jason Lee             Big U.S. tobacco companies are all developing e-cigarettes, battery-powered gadgets with a heating element that turns liquid nicotine and flavorings into a cloud of vapor that users inhale.   For the past decade, public health experts have debated whether the gadgets might help with smoking cessation or at least be a safer alternative to traditional combustible cigarettes, or whether “vaping” e-cigarettes or vape pens might lure a new generation into nicotine addiction.    The current study suggests at least some of the answers to these safety questions may have to account how people use e-cigarettes to get their nicotine hit, said Dr. Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin, a psychiatry researcher at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.    “The risks of short term and long term use of e-cigarettes are not known,” Krishnan-Sarin said by email.    While e-cigarettes may contain fewer toxicants than traditional cigarettes, they do contain chemicals like propylene glycol and glycerin, “which when heated at high temperatures like with ‘dripping’ can produce high levels of carcinogenic compounds like aldehydes,” Krishnan-Sarin added.    “E-liquids also contain many flavor chemicals such as aldehydes, vanillins and alcohols which are considered safe for ingestion, but little is known about the toxicity of inhaling these chemicals, especially when they are volatilized at high temperatures,” Krishnan-Sarin said.    To assess how often teens tried “dripping,” researchers examined 2015 survey data from 7,045 students in eight Connecticut high schools.    Overall, 1,080 teens, or about 15 percent, said they had tried e-cigarettes, researchers report in Pediatrics.    About 26 percent of e-cigarettes users had tried dripping. Most often, teens did this to produce thicker clouds of vapor, though they sometimes tried dripping to enhance flavors of the liquid nicotine or to heighten the feeling of smoke inhalation in the throat or lungs.    The study didn’t examine what flavors teens used for dripping or assess how much nicotine might be in the liquids adolescents used, the authors note.    Another limitation is that a large proportion of teens said they didn’t know whether they had tried dripping, which might have led the authors to underestimate the prevalence of this behavior.    It’s also not clear from one year of survey data that dripping is gaining in popularity, and it may actually be falling out of favor, said Dr. Riccardo Polosa, a researcher at the University of Catania in Italy who wasn’t involved in the study.    Dripping was common in the early days of e-cigarettes when the devices had open-system atomizers and no tanks to hold liquid, Polosa said by email. It was considered a nuisance because users had to carry a bottle with liquids, add more fluids frequently and worry about flooding the atomizer.   Newer e-cigarette devices make dripping unnecessary, Polosa said.   Still, there’s cause for concern, said Maciej Goniewicz, a researcher at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Although this study does not look at the health effects of ‘dripping’ in youths, laboratory tests showed that ‘dripping’ increases risk of inhaling high doses of nicotine and cancer-causing chemicals from e-cigarettes,” Goniewicz said by email.   “Inhaling aerosols from e-cigarettes seems to be less risky as compared to smoking tobacco cigarettes, but ‘dripping’ is not a safe technique for using e-cigarettes and should be avoided,” Goniewicz said.   "
2kktU3z,2017-02-06,Childhood cancer treatments tied to sex lives years later," (Reuters Health) - In general, childhood cancer survivors are just as satisfied with their sex lives as people who didn’t have cancer, a recent study suggests.     The cancer survivors had fewer lifetime sex partners, on average, than a comparison group that hadn’t had cancer, researchers found. Even so, as long as the cancer survivors were in satisfying relationships, they were satisfied with their sex lives, too.    Researchers also found, however, that children who received cancer treatments that were toxic to the brain had more trouble achieving certain milestones of psychosexual development, like first intercourse, number of lifetime sex partners, being in a relationship, and having biological children.   “We found what we expected, the high-dose (chemotherapy) group was the least likely to be sexually experienced, to be in relationships or to have children,” said lead author Vicky Lehmann, of the Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital and The Ohio State University in Columbus.       While marriage may be a milestone, she said, marrying later or not at all does not mean a person is unhappy with their life.   “It doesn’t matter whether you were 17, 18, 19 or 35 when you had your first boyfriend or girlfriend, as long as you’re happy,” Lehman told Reuters Health.   She was inspired to conduct this research, she said, after other studies found childhood cancer survivors were less likely to marry in adulthood than other people.   For the new study, she and her colleagues surveyed 144 survivors of childhood cancer and 144 people with similar background who didn’t have cancer during childhood. Participants were ages 20 to 40 when they answered questionnaires about their psychosexual development, sexual satisfaction and satisfaction with relationship status.   In both groups, first sexual experiences occurred around age 18. A similar proportion in each group had children and was partnered or married. Additionally, there was no difference in sexual satisfaction or relationship status satisfaction between the two groups.   Childhood cancer survivors reported about seven sexual partners during their lives, compared to about 11 among the comparison group, however.   The researchers also found differences based on the cancer patients’ treatments.    For example, people who received high-doses of neurotoxic treatments reported the lowest rates of achieving psychosexual development - but their satisfaction did not consistently differ from other participants.   The study can’t say why people who received the most toxic treatments are less likely to reach milestones, but Lehmann said it might be due to impairments from those treatments that leave some childhood cancer survivors with worse social skills to find partners.   If people are struggling, she said it’s important for them to look for help, such as at survivor clinics.   Lehmann also said it’s important to remember that many measurements of sexuality are subjective.   “They may not be achieving everything, but it doesn’t mean they’re less satisfied,” she said.  "
2kumfAA,2017-02-07,Synthetic marijuana substitutes are likely not safe," (Reuters Health) - Drugs known as K2 or Spice, often sold as “safe” or “legal” versions of marijuana, are none of those things, a research review concludes.    These synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs) are not detectable with standard drug screening for the active substance in marijuana because they are very different, and potentially dangerous, molecules, the study team writes in Trends in Pharmacological Sciences.   “Synthetic cannabinoids produce a number of adverse effects such as neurological, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal toxicities as well as tolerance, dependence, and even withdrawal,” lead author Benjamin Ford from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock said.   Evidence of K2 and Spice use in the United States was first reported in 2009, Ford and his colleagues write, but it wasn’t until late 2010 that the National Forensic Laboratory Information System reported tremendous spikes in K2 and Spice product usage.   “Alarmingly, there have been over 20 deaths reported between 2011 and 2014 due to some of these toxicities,” Ford told Reuters Health by email.    A major issue regarding acute toxicities of SCBs concerns the poor and inconsistent quality control of synthetic cannabinoids in these products, Ford said.    “It is common for a single K2 or Spice product to contain between three to five different synthetic cannabinoid compounds at arbitrary, and sometimes dangerous, doses,” he said.   Ford and his colleagues reviewed existing studies of the chemical structure of these compounds, how they work in the brain, how they affect animals in experiments, and the types of side effects seen among human users.    Ford concludes that terms like “synthetic marijuana” or “synthetic pot” are very misleading descriptions. They suggest that K2 and Spice products contain marijuana-like compounds and produce effects similar to those of marijuana, he said. But, the SCBs are much more potent than regular marijuana and sometimes cause more intense reactions.   It’s important to note that there is very little crossover between the adverse effects observed with synthetic cannabinoids and marijuana, he added.    “The problem is that people are abusing these new synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists because a lot of them don’t show up on the urine tox screen,” Dr. Rana Biary, an emergency physician at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York, told Reuters Health.    “So it’s a way to bypass any form of drug screen monitoring, and so a lot of people who are regularly having their own drug screens sent on might be using this in lieu of marijuana,” said Biary, who wasn’t involved in the review.   Biary noted that the earliest synthetic cannabinoids were chemically designed to look just like THC, the psychoactive substance in marijuana, and were studied as a way to reduce cancer-induced vomiting.   “But what ended up happening is there was an unexpected side effect where they found that people were having different effects, and so they then started to create different molecules that actually no longer resemble THC,” she said.   “The reason that we’re kind of getting concerned about synthetic cannabinoids now is that first of all, the molecules are changing so quickly that we actually don’t really know what is in the bag that people are selling,” Biary said.   “As soon as we start to regulate one, there’s already several that are down the pipeline of new synthetic cannabinoids that are available,” she said.   One problem in with overuse symptoms is that there’s no consistent presentation as far as symptoms, Biary added.    “So with one batch, patients might come in wildly agitated, screaming, needing to be restrained, needing large amounts of medication to sedate them, while the next batch, they’re coming in not breathing so well, their blood pressures might be low,” she said. “So part of the problem is the presentations are so unpredictable, and you can’t really say you know if someone overdosed on, or is using, a synthetic cannabinoid.”   "
2kegaEU,2017-02-06,Pet medicines pose poison risk for kids," (Reuters Health) - Parents who store medicines and household cleaners out of reach to protect their kids from accidental poisoning shouldn’t forget to consider any drugs they have for the family pet, a new study suggests.     Children five and under account for 88 percent of calls to poison control centers for exposure to veterinary medicines, researchers report in Pediatrics. In almost all of these cases, kids consumed drugs intended for the family pet.    About one in four of these poisonings happened while someone was trying to give medicine to a pet, the study also found.    “This could have happened if the pet spit the medicine out onto the floor then the child ate it or if the medicine was mixed in with food such as a hot dog or piece of cheese and the child ate the food containing the medicine,” said study co-author Kristin Roberts of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.   “The good news is that you can help keep everyone in the family a little safer by storing medicine for pets up and away and out of sight, only giving medicine to pets when the children aren’t in the room and by making sure the pet has taken the medicine,” Roberts added by email.    To assess the risk veterinary medicines pose to children, Roberts and colleagues analyzed data on 1,431 calls to a regional poison control center in Ohio from 1999 through 2013.    Most of the calls – 88 percent – related to medicines for dogs, the study found.    In 93 percent of cases, children ate or drank pet medicines. Another 2.3 percent of the calls involved children getting veterinary drugs in their eyes, and 1.1 percent of cases were for skin exposure.    While most instances happened at home and could be managed without a visit to the doctor, children went to a health facility for treatment in about 6 percent of cases.    When children did go to a hospital or health facility, they were evaluated and treated or released in about 60 percent of cases.    When parents were told children needed to see a doctor, the most common exposures were for pet pain medicines, or drugs for parasites, convulsions or other ailments.    In most cases, the children had few or no bothersome symptoms or didn’t require follow-up care because their exposure to the pet medicines was determined to be nontoxic or not that harmful.   The study was limited by the fact that it was done at a single poison center, and recording of different types of veterinary medicines by poison control specialists was inconsistent.    Not all families have pets, and the odds of poisoning from veterinary medicines may be lower than for other things around the house, said Dr. Carl Baum, a researcher at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, who wasn’t involved in the study.   Still, curious toddlers are going to be at risk, Baum added by email.    “Try as you might to teach toddlers not to explore/touch/taste/swallow objects, they will do so,” Baum said.    Child-resistant packaging, common with human medicines, isn’t a given with animal drugs, noted Dr. Kyran Quinlan, a researcher at Rush University Children’s Hospital in Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Families have to be particularly vigilant to protect their children from unintended ingestion when pills and medicines meant for their pet are brought into the house,” Quinlan, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Injury Violence and Poison Prevention, added by email.    “Kids will find them, and because they are naturally curious and explore everything, they will try to ingest them,” Quinlan said. “The safest thing would be to keep these animal pharmaceuticals locked up and out of reach when there are young children in the home.”  "
2k1jwes,2017-02-03,"For drowning victims, CPR sooner - even on the water - is better"," (Reuters Health) – Lifeguards who oversee open waters, such as oceans and lakes, may be able to deliver CPR effectively in a moving inflatable boat, according to a small study in Spain.   Surf-lifeguards provided the best cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on land but also delivered good-quality CPR on a small rescue boat, supporting the idea of starting CPR as soon as possible in real-life scenarios, researchers say.   “In cases of off-shore drowning, lifeguards should start CPR immediately and continue along the time required to reach the shore,” said study author Cristian Abelairas-Gomez of the University of Santiago de Compostela.    More research is focusing on out-of-hospital CPR in recent years, particularly lifeguards’ performance, he told Reuters Health by email. The European Resuscitation Council Guidelines put emphasis on open-water resuscitation in 2015, and experts are now investigating how different rescue scenarios affect CPR, he said.    The research team created an experimental simulation with 10 lifeguards on the Spanish island of Tenerife. The lifeguards were asked to perform two-minute CPR on training mannequins in four scenarios: onshore, on a floating boat, on a boat traveling at 5 knots and on a boat traveling at 10 knots. Each lifeguard had at least five years of experience, but none had on-boat CPR experience.    In all scenarios, the quality of CPR was measured by the number and depth of compressions and the degree of chest rise when breaths were administered to the mannequin. In all cases, the lifeguards’ scores surpassed the CPR “success threshold” of 70 percent. However, the quality of CPR did decrease as boat speed increased. In particular, the boat’s movement affected chest compression depth during CPR.   “Until more research is conducted, there may be a trade-off between quality of resuscitation during transport versus rapidly getting a victim to dry land,” said Stephen Langendorfer of Bowling Green State University in Ohio who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Since even highly-skilled professional lifeguards performed worse as speed increased, one could expect less well-skilled lifeguards to perhaps perform below the (CPR success) threshold,” he told Reuters Health by email.   Worldwide, more than 370,000 deaths are due to drowning each year, representing 0.7 percent of all unintentional injury deaths, according to the World Health Organization. In the United States, drowning is the leading cause of injury-related death among children ages 1 to 4, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    “Drowning is such a big problem and not publicized. The numbers are often underestimated,” said David Szpilman, medical director of SOBRASA, a drowning prevention group in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who also wasn’t involved in the study.    “There are so many variables in drowning scenarios that we don’t have a recipe to say exactly what to do next,” he told Reuters Health. “This study shows that as soon as you can ventilate, the better.”   The variables posed the biggest limitation in the study, the authors write in the Emergency Medicine Journal. Sea conditions, such as waves, wind speed, water temperature and distance to shore could result in different rescue scenarios.    During the tests in September 2015, conditions at Los Gigantes beach on the island’s west coast, where the testing was done, were cloudy, with calm winds, calm waves and water temperatures in the high 60s.   “In real life, sea conditions may be harder and CPR quality could be affected,” Abelairas-Gomez said. “For one of the first studies of CPR on a boat, we thought it was necessary to begin with calm conditions.”   Future studies will focus on harsher sea conditions and chest compressions on a moving boat, he added. In the current study, compared to onshore quality, chest compression depth dropped 20 percent at 10 knots and CPR quality decreased by 13 percent. There was also a 7 percent drop from CPR quality on an adrift boat versus a boat traveling at 10 knots.    “Drowning can happen to anyone, including those who know how to swim and think they can’t drown,” Szpilman said. “People underestimate the danger, especially when they’re used to calm swimming conditions in a pool.”  "
2kBno94,2017-02-03,U.S. patients have lower mortality rates with foreign-trained doctors," (Reuters Health) - U.S. patients may have lower mortality rates if their doctors were trained at foreign medical schools rather than at American universities, a recent study suggests.    Researchers examined data for more than 1.2 million hospitalizations handled by general internists at U.S. hospitals and found patients were slightly less likely to die within 30 days after admission if their doctor went to medical school in another country.    “Although we are uncertain exactly why foreign-trained doctors have slightly better outcomes, the U.S. currently sets a very high bar for foreign medical graduates to practice medicine in the U.S.,” said lead study author Dr. Yusuke Tsugawa, a policy and management researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.    “Therefore, the doctors who choose to leave their home country and manage to pass all certification exams may be very capable and motivated individuals,” Tsugawa said by email.    The absolute difference was small, with mortality rates of 11.2 percent for foreign-trained doctors versus 11.6 percent for U.S. medical school graduates.    After accounting for other factors that could contribute to patients’ outcomes, the mortality rate was 5 percent lower for foreign medical graduations. But that’s large enough to impact tens of thousands of patients nationwide.   International medical graduates make up a quarter of the physician workforce in the U.S., the UK, Canada and Australia, researchers note in the BMJ. In the U.S., doctors trained elsewhere treat a far greater proportion of patients in many rural and underserved communities, previous studies have shown.   The research team points out that in order to get a license to practice medicine in the U.S., foreign medical school graduates must pass two examinations that test medical knowledge and one examination that assesses clinical skills, and they must also complete several years of accredited residency training in the U.S.   For the current study, Tsugawa and colleagues examined data on patients 65 and older covered by Medicare who were treated by 44,227 general internists between 2011 and 2014.    Overall, 19,589 of the doctors, or 44 percent, were international medical school graduates. The foreign graduates tended to be slightly younger and were more likely to work in non-teaching hospitals, for-profit hospitals and hospitals without intensive care units.    In general, compared with patients treated by U.S. graduates, those seen by international graduates were less likely to be white, affluent or covered by private insurance. Patients seen by international doctors were also more likely to have multiple chronic health problems like congestive heart failure, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.   When researchers looked at conditions that commonly bring patients to the hospital, they found international graduates had significantly lower mortality rates for pneumonia and congestive heart failure.    The non-U.S. doctors had lower mortality rates for most other conditions, too, but the difference wasn’t big enough to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    There wasn’t a meaningful difference in readmission rates, or the proportion of patients who returned to the hospital again within 30 days of being sent home.    The study isn’t an experiment designed to prove whether doctors educated in the U.S. or other countries provide better care or help patients live longer, the authors note. Researchers also couldn’t distinguish between foreign-born international medical school graduates and U.S. citizens who left the country to train overseas.    It’s also possible that patients treated by foreign-trained doctors were different from people seen by U.S. medical school graduates in some ways that weren’t detected in the study, said Dr. Vineet Arora, a researcher at the University of Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study.    “I find the mortality difference hard to explain by educational or cultural differences alone given the varied educational experiences and cultural backgrounds of international medical graduates,” Arora added by email. “We do know that international doctors who gain entry into the US are often at the top of their class - so it’s certainly possible that this could explain the findings.”  "
2jGQUuE,2017-02-03,Impromptu ice bath helpful for exercise-induced heat stroke," (Reuters Health) - A tarp, volunteers and a lot of ice water can be used to rescue athletes and other people from heat stroke caused by exertion if a traditional ice bath is not available, according to a new study.   Researchers call the approach the “TACO method” because rescuers lift the edges of the tarp to form a taco shape and then pour ice water into the tarp to cool down the person with heat stroke.   Traditional cold-water immersion should still remain the standard treatment for exertional heat stroke, but the researchers say their impromptu method can be used in remote areas or emergency situations.   “Exertional heat stroke is potentially fatal,” said senior author Brendon McDermott, of the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. “It’s probably not 100 percent preventable, but with effective recognition and treatment it’s 100 percent survivable and TACO represents one method that can be used as effective treatment for that individual.”   Exertional heat stroke occurs when a person’s body temperature rises through activities like working in the sun or running on a hot day, McDermott told Reuters Health.    The body’s cells begin to die when a person’s temperature reaches 104 to 105 degrees Fahrenheit (about 40 degrees Celsius), he said. “Without effective treatment,” he added, “you will have multiple organs that fail and that’s what leads to the demise afterward.”   The gold-standard treatment is to immerse the patient in a bathtub with circulating ice water, but this can sometimes be a logistical challenge, the researchers say.    For the new study, the researchers recruited nine men and seven women in their 20s or early 30s to run or cycle until their body temperature reached about 102 degrees F (39 degrees C).   They were trying to mimic industry settings or situations in athletics or in the military where people might get dangerously overheated, McDermott said.   Participants were then instructed to lie down in a tarp for 15 minutes or until their body temperature reached about 101 degrees F (38.1 degrees C).   During one run of the experiment, volunteers lifted the edges of the tarp to form a taco shape. Then they poured about 40 gallons (151 liters) of water that was about 35 degrees F (2.1 degrees C) over each participant.   In a second run of the experiment, the same participants were again told to lie down on the tarp but this time no cold water was poured on them.   Overall, body temperatures declined at a per-minute rate of about 0.25 degrees F (about 0.14 degrees C) with cold water in the tarp, compared to 0.07 degrees F (about 0.04 degrees C) when cold water wasn’t used.   The researchers conclude that the TACO method is an appropriate alternative when money, location and space make a proper ice bath impractical or unobtainable.   McDermott said the TACO method could be used in schools and industrial situations.   The study findings are reported in the November issue of the Journal of Athletic Training, which according to the National Association of Athletic trainers wasn’t released until early January.  "
2kmi4nF,2017-02-02,Fat shaming tied to increased risk of metabolic problems," (Reuters Health) - Obese people who feel stigmatized about their size are not only more likely to struggle with weight loss, they’re also more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders, a new study suggests.                     An overweight woman sits on a chair in Times Square in New York, May 8, 2012. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson       In many cultures, people who are obese are viewed as stereotypically lazy, lacking in willpower, incompetent, unattractive and personally responsible for their excess weight, researchers note in the journal Obesity. These negative beliefs, known as weight bias, can cause obese people to experience discrimination, which is in turn associated with an increased risk of “internalizing disorders” like depression, anxiety and low self-esteem, previous research has found.    For the current study, researchers focused on what’s known as metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors for heart disease, stroke and diabetes. People with this syndrome typically have at least three of these five problems: excess belly fat, high triglycerides, low levels of “good” cholesterol, elevated blood pressure and high levels of sugar in the blood.    Participants who internalized weight-related stigma were 41 percent more likely to experience metabolic syndrome than people who didn’t internalize stigma very much, after accounting for depression and the degree of obesity, the study found.   “Experiencing weight stigma can elicit a physiological stress response, marked by elevated blood pressure and inflammation, and it’s possible that self-directed weight stigma may be a form of chronic stress as well,” said lead study author Rebecca Pearl, a psychiatry researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.   “Individuals who internalize weight bias may also engage in unhealthy behaviors to cope with this stress – such as eating high-caloric comfort foods – which could affect triglycerides and other cardiometabolic risk factors measured in this study,” Pearl added by email. “Additionally, when people apply negative weight stereotypes to themselves, such as being lazy or lacking willpower, they have less confidence in their ability to engage in healthy behaviors, such as physical activity.”   For the study, Pearl and colleagues examined data from lab tests for risk factors of metabolic syndrome and from questionnaires assessing weight stigma in 178 obese adults.    Overall, 51 people, or 32 percent, had metabolic syndrome.    When researchers accounted for other patient characteristics in addition to depression and the degree of obesity, the connection between weight stigma and metabolic syndrome was no longer statistically meaningful, the study found.    The study was funded by Eisai Pharmaceutical Co., which sells a prescription weight-loss drug. One study author served on advisory boards for Nutrisystem, Weight Watchers and Novo Nordisk, a maker of diabetes treatments.    The study wasn’t an experiment designed to prove how different levels of weight stigma directly cause metabolic syndrome, the authors note. It’s also possible that the results based on a group of patients participating in an obesity treatment study might not necessarily reflect what would happen with obese people in real life.    Still, discrimination clearly can cause chronic stress, which can result in biochemical changes that contribute to weight gain and inflammation that lead to abnormalities in blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol, said Dr. Kimberly Gudzune of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.    “It can start you down a pathway that increases your risk for cardiovascular disease,” Gudzune, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.    In part to avoid making feelings of discrimination and stress worse, doctors treating patients for obesity should choose their words carefully, said Dr. Anne McTiernan, a researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington in Seattle who wasn’t involved in the study.    “I would like people with obesity and their health care providers see the number on the scale as an indicator of health, just like their blood pressure,” McTiernan added by email. “The goal with excess blood pressure is to get the number down, not to subject the patient to shame. Similarly, let’s treat the number on the scale as a measure of health risk, and help the patient get the number down effectively and safely, and help them avoid gaining the weight back.”  "
2jx42m2,2017-02-02,"Maternity, paternity leave rates in the U.S. remain low"," (Reuters Health) - The proportion of U.S. women taking maternity leave has remained about the same for the past two decades, according to a new study.   Laws mandating paid leave in four states and an expanding national economy have had no impact on the proportion of working women who take maternity leave, which remains at about 678 per 10,000 births, an economist reports in the American Journal of Public Health.   “The U.S. economy has expanded dramatically since the middle of the 1990s,” Jay Zagorsky, from the Ohio State University Center for Human Resource Research in Columbus, told Reuters Health. “Since 1994, it’s gone up about 66 percent after adjusting for inflation, and none of those benefits have flowed to women on maternity leave.”   The Family and Medical Leave Act entitles employees of companies covered by the law to 12 weeks of unpaid time off during the first 12 months after the birth of a baby or the adoption of a child.     But the U.S. Department of Labor estimated in 2015 that only 12 percent of private sector workers have access to paid family leave, Zagorsky writes.   He found that men are increasingly taking opportunities for paternity leave, whether paid or unpaid, but the total numbers are still tiny.   “There’s a tremendous growth in paternity leave, but we started at such a really low base, like 6,000 men per month, and now we’re up to 22,000,” Zagorsky said.   But there are over 300,000 babies born in the U.S. each month, he  said, “so we’re up to 22,000 men taking care of newborn children, out of a third of a million each month.”   For the study, he analyzed data from a monthly national survey that includes about 60,000 randomly selected households.   Based on data for the years 1994 through 2015, he found that about 273,000 new mothers took time off during a typical month, and the rate remained fairly steady over time.   Women on maternity leave tended to be older than the average woman who gave birth, as well as more educated, more likely to be married and more likely to be white.   Currently, only about half of all maternity leaves are paid, but there has been a slow upward trend, Zagorsky said. “If you average that trend, it’s a quarter of 1 percent a year, which means every four years we go up one percentage point. Every eight years we go up two percentage points, and so on.”    At this rate, it would take roughly 200 years for the U.S. to catch up with 98 other countries that require working women to receive at least 14 weeks of paid time off after a baby is born, he added.       “The newborn period is a naturally incredible moment in a family’s life,” said Dr. Jillian Parekh, a primary care pediatrician at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City who was not involved in the study.     “It’s always a very intense, emotional experience,” she said. “Mostly positive, but it’s also a really difficult time, and newborns are challenging. There is exhaustion, and there are lots of factors that make it a tough experience.”   Parekh thinks it’s important for mothers and fathers to have time to recover physically from the experience and to bond with the baby. “And have time to form those most important relationships in the most formative time in a newborn’s life.”   The first three months of life are critical for newborns to secure an attachment with their parents, and for their physical and emotional needs to be met, Parekh added. “I’ve just always felt strongly that it’s sort of setting up a good pattern and a good family relationship that can hopefully continue throughout childhood,” she said.   A lot of people rely on other family members if they don’t have paid leave and there have been new laws that have been put in place to make pumping and breastfeeding at work possible, she noted.    “I always try to empower my patients, and my friends, and my family, to ask more and to see what’s really available and to see if there’s something creative that can be done within your maternity leave rules,” Parekh said.

2k5KjZC,2017-02-02,&#039;Heading&#039; in soccer may lead to concussion symptoms," (Reuters Health) - Purposely “heading” a soccer ball may lead to concussion symptoms despite research suggesting those issues mainly arise from accidental knocks to the head, according to a new study.   While amateur soccer players were at an increased risk of concussion-like symptoms from colliding with each other and objects, they also had an increased risk for those symptoms if they often used their head to hit the ball - an action known as heading.   The new study can’t say heading leads to brain damage or other issues down the road, however.   “There is enough here to say there may be risk,” said senior author Dr. Michael Lipton, a neuroradiologist and neuroscientist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Health System in New York City.   “We’re reporting on effects in the very short term,” he told Reuters Health. “These are really immediate symptoms. This paper does not address the long term consequences.”   Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, Lipton and his colleagues write in the journal Neurology. Recent research suggested concussion-like symptoms among young soccer players were caused by accidental collisions - not heading.   For the new study, the researchers recruited adult amateur soccer players living around New York City to take part in a large study known as the Einstein Soccer Study. Part of the study included online surveys that asked how often the participants played soccer over the past two weeks, how often they head the ball, if they took any hits to the head and if they experienced any negative symptoms like pain, dizziness and unconsciousness.   Overall, 470 surveys were completed by 222 participants in 2013 and 2014. The participants were between ages 18 and 55, and about 80 percent were men.    The researchers found that 37 percent of men reported accidental hits to the head. Men headed the ball an average of 44 times during a two week span. Women headed the ball an average of 27 times over the same length of time, and 43 percent reported unintentional hits to the head.   About 20 percent of participants reported moderate to severe concussion-like symptoms.   Compared to those who reported the least amount of accidental hits to the head, the participants who reported the most were about six times more likely to experience symptoms.   After adjusting for accidental hits, the researchers found those who were heading the ball the most were more than three times as likely to experience those symptoms as those who reported doing it the least.   “There is not enough information here to say that heading is universally evil or causing people to be brain damaged,” said Lipton. Ultimately, he said, it would be good to know if heading does lead to cognitive problems years later, and if that could somehow be prevented.    “I think what we need to try to understand is if continuous heading is contributing to the long term problems of dementia or are they an epiphenomenon - something that happens but doesn’t cause any trauma or injury,” said Dr. Jeffrey Bazarian, a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.   Concussions in soccer are understudied, compared to football, said Bazarian, who was not involved with the new study. Technology advances such as sensors that measure hits to the head will make research easier in this area.   “We’re going to see a profusion of information that’s going to be really helpful,” he said.  "
2kuezhN,2017-02-02,Evaluators often disagree about who needs disability benefits," (Reuters Health) - Medical experts who assess workers to see if they need disability benefits often don’t reach the same conclusion, according to a review of research that questions the quality of these evaluations.   Private insurers and government programs in many countries worldwide use medical experts to evaluate workers who claim that illness or injury limits their ability to work. The experts decide whether the employee’s health problems merit disability benefits designed to replace lost wages.   For the current study, researchers examined data in 23 studies conducted between 1992 and 2016 in 12 countries in Europe, North America, the Middle East and Northeast Africa.    In 63 percent of studies, medical experts reached only low to moderate agreement on workers’ capacity to do their jobs, researchers report in The BMJ.   “This problem seems to be universal,” said senior study author Dr. Regina Kunz, a researcher at the University of Basel in Switzerland.    “What we found is the challenge to decide on the threshold when a health problem is ‘severe enough’ to qualify for disability benefits,” Kunz added by email. “No gold standard exists as of today to determine this threshold.”   For the current analysis, Kunz and colleagues examined data from 16 studies conducted in an insurance setting and seven done in research settings.    Studies done in the insurance setting were conducted with medical experts assessing claimants who were actual workers seeking disability benefits or actors portraying hypothetical cases.    Workers were seeking benefits for mental health problems in 38 percent of cases, physical injuries or illnesses in 25 percent of instances and a combination of both mental and physical issues in 38 percent of cases.    Only seven of the insurance studies, or 44 percent, were generalizable to real life evaluations, the study found. Another three insurance studies, or 19 percent, were rated as “probably generalizable.”   Researchers saw an “excellent” level of reliability in results for just two insurance studies.    By contrast, five of the studies done in research settings, or 71 percent, had “excellent” reliability in results, the current analysis found.    Conclusions were particularly unreliable when medical experts assessed workers for subjective complaints or chronic health problems, or when they didn’t use a standardized set of measurements or questions to determine if people needed disability benefits.    Taken together, the authors conclude, these results suggest that there might be greater need for strategies to improve agreement when patients present with subjective complaints and better understanding of factors that contribute to variability in evaluations of capacity to work.    One limitation of the current study is that the researchers looked at previous studies with wide variation in design, outcome measurements and size, the authors note. This made it difficult to draw statistically meaningful conclusions from the current analysis, they point out.    Mental health problems in particular can stymie evaluators, and are often exacerbated because people don’t get adequate mental health care or vocational services, said Dr. Robert Drake, a health policy researcher at The Dartmouth Institute in Hanover, New Hampshire, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Many people are disabled temporarily and need help but get trapped in the disability system,” Drake said by email. “Continuing reviews do not help. We need to have more sensible rules, and patients need better mental health and vocational services.”  "
2jZqFhw,2017-02-01,Sleep tied to sexual activity and satisfaction among older women," (Reuters Health) - Older women who sleep well at night are more likely to have satisfying sex lives, a recent study suggests.    Postmenopausal women reported less sexual activity and less sexual satisfaction if they also had trouble sleeping through the night, researchers found.   Based on the findings, doctors may want to consider an older woman’s overall health if she brings up issues like sexual satisfaction, said lead author Dr. Juliana Kling, a women’s health internist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona.   “When a patient is asking me about a sexual health concern, it’s important for me to look at other aspects of her health and ask about sleep,” she told Reuters Health.   For the new study, Kling and colleagues analyzed data collected from nearly 94,000 women, ages 50 to 79, who were enrolled in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study. The women had answered questions about their sexual function in the previous year and their sleep in the previous month.   Overall, 56 percent of the women reported being at least somewhat satisfied with their current sexual activity. Additionally, 52 percent reported sexual activity with a partner during the previous year.   Nearly one third of women had insomnia, as determined by a tool that takes into account their ability to fall asleep, how often they wake during the night and overall sleep quality.   After accounting for variables that may influence the results, like hot flashes and vaginal dryness, the researchers found that women who scored high on the insomnia tool were about 8 percent less likely to report being satisfied with their sex lives.   The researchers also report in the journal Menopause that sexual activity and satisfaction decreased with shorter sleep duration.   Women who slept six hours per night were about 6 percent less likely to be sexually active and 6 percent less likely to be sexually satisfied, compared to women who slept seven to eight hours per night.   Likewise, women who slept only about five hours per night were about 12 percent less likely to be sexually active and 12 percent less likely to be sexually satisfied than those who slept seven to eight hours per night.   “The study suggests high-quality and sufficient sleep is important for sexual function,” said Kling.   The results don’t prove poor sleep causes less sexual activity and satisfaction, however. The study also can’t say whether increasing sleep duration would improve the women’s sex lives.   “It certainly suggests that, but it’s an observational study we can’t show the directionality of that relationship,” Kling said.   Women and their doctors should recognize how symptoms of menopause and sleep affect women’s lives, including their health, work, home and relationships, said Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, who is executive director of the North American Menopause Society.   “We know that seven hours of sleep have been determined by the national sleep foundation as best for your cognitive functioning and prevention of Alzheimer’s,” said Pinkerton, who is also affiliated with the University of Virginia Health System in Charlottesville.   For women having trouble with sleep, there are a number of interventions that may help, including short-term hormone therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and good sleep hygiene, Pinkerton told Reuters Health.   “Paying attention to getting seven hours of sleep per night is one of the most important things you can do for your family, your relationship your work and your health,” said Pinkerton, who was not involved with the new study.

2jw5p4s,2017-02-01,Toxic chemicals in one-third of fast food packaging," (Reuters Health) - Fast food isn’t exactly known for its health benefits, but a new U.S. study suggests even the packaging may be harmful.    That’s because the study found one-third of fast food packaging contains chemicals known as PFASs (for polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances) that give it stain-resistant, water-repellant and nonstick properties. The trouble is these fluorinated chemicals have also been linked to an increased risk of certain cancers, hormone problems, high cholesterol, obesity and immune suppression in human and animal studies.   “Our study is the most comprehensive assessment of how common fluorinated chemicals are in fast food wrappers in the U.S., and which types of wrappers are most likely to contain them,” said lead study author Laurel Schaider of the Silent Spring Institute in Newton, Massachusetts.   “We found that nearly half of paper wrappers, for instance wrappers for sandwiches and burgers and flat bags for cookies and pastries, contained fluorinated chemicals, and that around 20 percent of paperboard packaging, for instance boxes for French fries and fried foods, contained fluorinated chemicals,” Schaider added by email.    PFASs aren’t found naturally in the environment. These man-made chemicals have been used for decades in products ranging from food wrappers to clothing, nonstick cookware and fire-fighting foams. People may be exposed to PFASs from direct contact with these products, through the air they breathe, the food they eat and the water they drink.    For the study, Schaider and colleagues tested for PFASs in more than 400 samples of paper wrappers, paperboard and drink containers from 27 fast food chains across the U.S.   More than half of the tests were done on food contact paper, including 138 wrappers for sandwiches or burgers, 68 wrappers for dessert or bread and 42 wrappers for Tex-Mex foods.    Overall, 46 percent of paper wrappers tested positive for PFASs. This included 38 percent of sandwich and burger wrappers, 56 percent of bread or dessert wrappers and 57 percent of wrappers for Tex-Mex food, researchers report in Environmental Science and Technology Letters.    Tests of 30 samples from paper cups didn’t turn up any of these chemicals. But in tests of 25 other beverage containers, 16 percent did have PFASs.    Researchers also did more extensive testing on a subset of 20 samples to see what types of PFASs were in the food packaging. Six of these samples contained a type of PFASs called PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid, or C8) that many U.S. manufacturers voluntarily stopped using in 2011 due to concerns about the potential health risks.   One limitation of the study is that researchers were unable to assess how often people came into contact with these chemicals in food packaging, the authors note.    Still, the results show that even chemicals being phased out due to health concerns are still widely used, said Dr. Leonardo Trasande, an environmental medicine researcher at New York University School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study.    “This study reinforces the reality that these chemicals are highly persistent in the environment, and may find their ways into people’s bodies for years after they are no longer intentionally added,” Trasande said by email.   “This study adds to concerns about chemicals that contaminate highly processed or packaged foods, potentially magnifying health effects above and beyond the effects that may result from their high-fat or high-sugar content,” Trasande added.    Avoiding fast food is one way to limit exposure.    Serving food in wax paper instead of grease-resistant wrappers typically used in food packaging might also reduce contact with the chemicals, Trasande said.    Diners can also limit exposure by avoiding oily food, high-temperature food and taking food out of wrappers right away so it has less contact time with any chemicals, said Xindi Hu, an environmental health researcher at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.     Whenever possible, customers should avoid disposable packaging, Hu added by email.    “If they are dining in, then it is not necessary to use paper plates,” Hu said. “Some restaurants do not provide regular dishes for logistical reasons, but from the perspective of reducing exposure to chemicals in food packaging, it is actually encouraged that restaurants use more regular dishes.”  "
2jRTj1V,2017-02-01,Jet lag dampens Major League Baseball players’ performance," (Reuters Health) - Bookmakers have long factored home-field advantage into a baseball team’s odds of winning, but a new study suggests that jet lag could wipe it out.   Researchers analyzed more than 46,000 Major League Baseball games played over the course of 20 years - from 1992 until 2011 - and saw the home-field advantage disappear when the home team traveled two time zones east and the away team visited from the same time zone.    “We all know intuitively from experience what it means to be jet-lagged,” said senior researcher Dr. Ravi Allada, a circadian rhythms expert and neurobiology professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.    “We all know it will impact our own performance,” he said in a phone interview. “I think we showed very specifically what it is.”   Pitchers – on both home and away teams – gave up more home runs when they presumably suffered jet lag as a result of traveling through two time zones, the researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.   Jet-lagged home-team pitchers allowed enough home runs to negate their home-field advantage, Allada said.   Prior studies have shown that eastward travel is more likely to desynchronize internal clocks than westward travel, the authors write. The new study confirmed that eastward travel was more likely to alter baseball players’ performance.   Surprisingly, when both teams were jet-lagged, the offense for eastbound jet-lagged home teams suffered more than the offense of jet-lagged away teams, the study showed. The eastward-traveling home teams ran and stole fewer bases, batted in fewer doubles and triples and hit more double plays, the analysis found.   Allada hypothesized that traveling players may follow stricter schedules, which could help them recover faster from jet lag, than players on the home team. Baseball players also may have more responsibilities and obligations when they are at home and less time to adjust their clocks, he said.   When games are two time zones or more away, coaches should consider having their starting pitchers fly a day or two before games to adjust their clocks to the local environment, Allada said.   The same advice could apply to athletes on other sports teams as well as to travelers in other professions, including military pilots, Allada said. A Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency grant partly funded the study.   After staying up late and sleeping in over the weekend, adolescents face similar disruptions to their circadian rhythms on Monday mornings if they must rise at 6 a.m. and take tests at 8 a.m., said Dr. Asha Singh, medical director of the Sleep Disorder Program at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.   People who work night and graveyard shifts also must adjust their clocks. Exposing themselves to bright lights and taking supplements containing melatonin, a naturally secreted hormone, a few hours before bedtime can help, Singh said in a phone interview. She was not involved with the new study.   The new research replicates what she’s seen in patients in the sleep lab, she said.   Eating at regular intervals and exercising earlier in the day also can help regulate circadian rhythms, Singh said.    Nighttime exercise delays the release of melatonin, which is necessary to go to sleep. “You want to make sure you’re not asking your players to do that,” she said.   Light and genetics are the most powerful factors, she said.   “It’s genetic how easily you’re able to shift,” she said. “It’s actually encoded in your DNA, even in fruit flies.”  "
2kgYF7D,2017-02-01,Immigration raids tied to greater risk of underweight babies," (Reuters Health) - In the aftermath of an immigration raid, Latina women in the U.S. may be more likely to have low birthweight or premature babies even when they are citizens, a new study suggests.    To explore the link between immigration policy and pregnancy outcomes, researchers examined data on babies born before and after U.S. authorities arrested 400 undocumented workers at a kosher slaughterhouse and meatpacking plant in Postville, Iowa, in 2008. At the time, it was the largest single site raid in U.S. history.    “The Postville raid caused a great deal of fear and distress for immigrant and U.S.-born Latinos throughout the state of Iowa, including pregnant mothers,” said lead study author Nicole Novak, a researcher at the University of Michigan Population Studies Center in Ann Arbor.    “We know that emotional stress can affect pregnant mothers and their infants’ gestation in many ways, including shifting stress hormone balances in ways that affect a developing fetus,” Novak added by email. “Social support networks can help protect against these effects, but after the Postville raid fear isolated people from one another, reducing emotional support and leaving them doubly vulnerable.”   Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born after 37 weeks are considered full term. Babies who arrive earlier often have difficulty breathing and digesting food in the weeks immediately after birth. Preemies can also encounter longer-term challenges such as impaired vision, hearing and cognitive skills as well as social and behavioral problems.   For the study, researchers analyzed birth records for 52,344 infants born in Iowa either during the 37 weeks after the raid or in the same 37-week period the previous year.    Babies born to Latina mothers after the raid were 24 percent more likely to be underweight than infants born the year before, researchers report in the International Journal of Epidemiology.    Among foreign-born Latina mothers, 4.5 percent of newborns were underweight before the raid, compared with 5.6 percent afterwards. Among Latina mothers born in the U.S., 5.3 percent of infants were underweight before the raid, compared with 6.4 percent afterwards.    Premature births were also more common for Latina mothers after the raid, though this primarily impacted foreign-born women. Among Latinas born outside the U.S., 7.5 percent of infants were premature before the raid, and this increased to 8.9 percent afterwards.    But for white mothers, the odds of underweight or premature babies didn’t change significantly after the raid.    The proportion of white and Latina women getting adequate prenatal care, which can help reduce the risk of underweight or preterm babies, was little changed during the study period.    “This suggests that the effect of these raids on low birth weight is the result of psychosocial mechanisms such as stress or decreased social support rather than medical care use,” said Steven Wallace, associate director of the Center for Health Policy Research at the University of California, Los Angeles.    Because the adverse pregnancy outcomes extended to U.S.-born Latina mothers, this also suggests that the climate of fear in the aftermath of the raid impacted the entire community, not just immigrants, Wallace, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.    One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on where in Iowa mothers lived, making it impossible to know how much of the change in birth outcomes occurred closer to Postville, the authors note.    Even so, the results offer clear evidence of physical health problems that can result from stress experienced by immigrant populations, said Mina Fazel, a psychiatry researcher at the University of Oxford in the UK who wasn’t involved in the study.   “There is little benefit in raising levels of distress in any population, especially in those who already experience socio-economic deprivations, social stigma and little housing stability,” Fazel added by email.    Current U.S. policies restricting immigration by refugees and citizens of certain predominantly Muslim countries may also negatively impact birth outcomes, Fazel remarked.     “The increasing Islamophobia that these policy changes feed into in the U.S. is likely to have an impact on all Muslims in the country,” Fazel said.

2jKJLYI,2017-01-31,"African-Americans suffer inordinate loss of parents, children and siblings"," (Reuters Health) - By the time they turned 10 years old, black children born in the U.S. in the 1980s were three times more likely than white children to have lost their mothers and twice as likely to have lost their fathers, a new study shows.   Lead researcher Debra Umberson imagines the grieving children and the far-reaching repercussions of their losses when looking at her study’s broader findings: compared to white individuals, black people born between 1900 and 1984 had to cope far more often with the deaths of their parents, siblings and even their children, earlier and throughout their lives.   “It’s a national crisis,” she said in a phone interview. “The effects of these deaths reverberate throughout these communities.”   Umberson, a sociology professor at the University of Texas at Austin, and her team compared national statistics for blacks and whites between 1900 and 1965 and between 1980 and 1984. The findings point to the “the spiraling damage” of racial disparities, the authors write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.   Blacks born from 1900 through 1965 were twice as likely as whites to have lost their mothers and 50 percent more likely to have lost their fathers by the age of 20, the study found. By age 60, they were nearly twice as likely to have lost a spouse and 50 percent more likely to have lost a sibling.   “I’m almost 60. I have never lost anyone,” said Umberson, who is white.   One of the statistics that startled her most was the racial disparity for child loss. Blacks born in the 1980s were two and a half times more likely to have lost a child by age 20 than whites, the study found. Blacks born from 1900 to 1965 were more than three times more likely to have lost a child between the ages of 50 and 70.    “All of these losses are very scarring. It’s parents losing children; it’s children losing parents, and it’s altering the families these people come from,” she said.   Jocelyn R. Smith Lee, a psychology professor at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, has seen the toll of grief and loss on young men she interviewed in Baltimore.   “The study echoes and affirms what young black men have been communicating to me is happening in their daily lives,” she told Reuters Health.    They grapple with the loss of their relatives and friends, and they so often see death that they fear for their own lives, Lee said.   A 19-year-old man in East Baltimore told her: “It’s a lot of work to keep your life.”    The news media have reported on the disproportionate number of black men killed on the streets, Umberson said. But blacks die even more frequently from illness.   “I think it’s extraordinarily important that we draw attention to the race difference in homicide,” Umberson said. “Violence is a leading cause of death.”   “It’s a big deal, but others are even bigger. Cancer, diabetes, heart disease, perinatal conditions contribute to more of the race difference in life expectancy than homicide,” she said.   Previous studies have shown that mourning increases the risk for mental and physical illness, and the consequences may be particularly rough and lasting for grieving children and young adults, the authors write.    Often, when children return to school after experiencing the death of a mother, father, sister or brother, their teachers have no idea, Umberson said.   “The kid just comes back and starts acting out,” she said.   Umberson and Lee both called for programs to help teachers, doctors and others to identify children who are in grief and to provide needed support.   Some of the young men Lee interviewed in Baltimore told her she was the first person who talked to them about the violence they confront daily.   One youth told her he expected to die before he turned 25. When she interviewed him again, he had passed the milestone.    He rolled up to meet her in a wheelchair. He’d been shot in both legs during a robbery just past his 25th birthday.   "
2jznKZG,2017-01-31,"Skipping breakfast may be bad for your heart, doctors say"," (Reuters Health) - Planning meals and snacks in advance and eating breakfast every day may help lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, new guidelines from U.S. doctors say.                     A traditional full English breakfast of sausages, chips, baked beans, bacon, black pudding and toast is pictured at 'Enough To Feed an Elephant' cafe in London May 24, 2012.   REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo       Eating more calories earlier in the day and consuming less food at night may also reduce the odds of a heart attack, stroke or other cardiac or blood vessel diseases, according to the scientific statement from the American Heart Association.    “When we eat may be important to consider, in addition to what we eat,” said Marie-Pierre St-Onge, chair of the group that wrote the guidelines and a nutrition researcher at Columbia University Medical Center in New York.    As many as 30 percent of U.S. adults may routinely skip breakfast, a habit that has become more common in recent years as more people snack throughout the day instead of sitting down for three traditional meals, St-Onge and colleagues note in the journal Circulation.    When people do eat breakfast daily, they’re less likely to have risk factors for cardiovascular disease like high cholesterol and elevated blood pressure. And people who skip this morning meal are more likely to have risk factors like obesity, poor nutrition and diabetes or high blood sugar.   That’s because meal timing may affect health by impacting the body’s internal clock. We may not process sugars as well at night as we do during the day, and studies of shift workers have linked this schedule with a greater risk of obesity and heart disease than a typical day job, St-Onge said by email.   “We know from population studies that eating breakfast is related to lower weight and healthier diet, along with lower risk of cardiovascular disease,” St-Onge said.    “However, interventions to increase breakfast consumption in those who typically skip breakfast do not support a strong causal role of this meal for weight management, in particular,” St-Onge cautioned. “Adding breakfast, for some, leads to an additional meal and weight gain.”   It’s possible that some people who add breakfast aren’t eating the right things or cutting back on what they eat later in the day, resulting in more calories but not necessarily good nutrition.    A healthy diet is heavy on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, poultry and fish, according to the guidelines. Eating well also means limiting red meat, salt and foods high in added sugars.   Plotting out what to eat ahead of time, especially for busy people who eat on the go, can help create a diet that’s better for heart health, St-Onge said.    “Planning ahead and making healthy, carry-on foods is important,” St-Onge suggested. “This could be a homemade smoothie or whole grain muffin or cereal bar for breakfast; packing a sandwich or leftovers for those times when time is tight.”   Advance thought can also help people eat the right amount of food throughout the day and eat at the right time, said Samantha Heller, a nutritionist at New York University Langone Medical Center who wasn’t involved in the guidelines.   “The ‘eating several small meals’ during the day advice that we commonly hear is unrealistic for most people because the ‘small’ meals often turn into meal-sized meals and weight gain is inevitable,” Heller said by email.    “Another booby trap for overeating is after dinner,” Heller added. “Night time eating is quite common and an easy way to add unnecessary calories and pack on the pounds over time because people snack when in front of TV, computer and tablet screens.”   Heller’s advice: “Once dinner is finished, the kitchen should be closed. If your schedule is crazy and you cannot get to dinner until later in the evening, then eat light at night.”  "
2knKDnf,2017-01-31,Exposure to violence tied to risk of teen gun possession," (Reuters Health) - Adolescents with criminal records may be more likely to carry guns if they have witnessed or experienced violence, a U.S. study suggests.    Plenty of previous research has linked gun use among young people to the availability and visibility of weapons in their homes and communities. The current study focused on teen boys found guilty of serious crimes and found every exposure to violence was associated with 43 to 87 percent higher odds that these young men would carry guns.   “Experiencing trauma, whether by witnessing drive-by shootings in the neighborhood or a school classmate being shot, impacts every sphere of an adolescent’s life - invalidating expectations of finding safety in the world and shattering optimistic beliefs about the future,” said lead study author Joan Reid, a criminology researcher at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg.   “Repeated exposure to violence gradually desensitizes adolescents to the risks and they become numb to the dangerous reality,” Reid added by email. “Paradoxically, gun carrying makes them feel safer while actually increasing their likelihood of an early death.”   For the current study, researchers surveyed 1,170 young men ages 14 to 19 who had been found guilty of a serious criminal offense in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Phoenix, Arizona.   After the initial survey, researchers assessed participants at four and six month intervals between 2000 and 2003 to see how often they carried guns, experienced psychological distress or were exposed to violence.    Most of the teens were around 14 years old at the time of their first arrest, and roughly half of them had carried guns at least once.   Witnessing violence was associated with 43 to 59 percent higher odds of gun carrying, researchers report in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Experiencing violence was tied to 63 to 87 percent higher odds of gun carrying.    The findings in teen boys may not apply to teen girls, the authors note. It’s also possible that other factors may have influenced gun carrying, particularly because so many of the boys in the study had handled weapons prior to joining the trial.    For parents trying to prevent violence exposure and gun use, there aren’t a lot of easy answers, said Deanna Wilkinson, a researcher at Ohio State University in Columbus who wasn’t involved in the study.    Surrounding children with positive adult role models, and getting to know their friends and the families of their friends can help, Wilkinson said. So can reading to kids from birth and trying to keep teens focused on education.    But these efforts may still not be enough to overcome the stress and exposure to trauma that happens when children grow up in a violent community.    “Move out of the most dangerous neighborhoods or schools if at all possible” Wilkinson said. “Do not enable your child to slide into gray or black market hustles even if poverty is a problem.”   In reality, this often isn’t possible.    “Because serious crime and economic distress are so tightly linked, it is very difficult for parents to entirely eliminate the risk that their children will be exposed to violence, experience psychological distress, or even carry guns,” said Alex Piquero, a researcher at the University of Texas in Dallas who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Parents need to do the best job they can at raising their kids to be good students, respect the law, and stay away from the fray, so to speak,” Piquero added by email. “At the same time, local officials and city leaders must continue to do all they can to help bolster distressed communities by developing meaningful employment opportunities and establishing top-performing educational institutions.”   "
2kaeRaL,2017-01-30,Active lifestyle linked with healthier blood pressure in African-Americans," (Reuters Health) - African-Americans are less likely to develop high blood pressure if they’re physically active throughout the week, according to a new study of people living in Jackson, Mississippi.   African-Americans who reported getting the ideal amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity at the start of the study were about 24 percent less likely to have hypertension, or high blood pressure, years later compared to those who weren’t active, researchers found.   They write in the journal Hypertension that African-Americans have the highest rate of high blood pressure of any racial or ethnic group in the U.S. The condition is tied to health conditions such as heart attack, stroke and kidney disease, and to premature death.   “If you’re African American, your odds of developing hypertension is pretty high,” said lead author Dr. Keith Diaz, of Columbia University Medical Center in New York. “If you’re worried about hypertension or high blood pressure, one of the things you can do to prevent it is physical activity and exercise.”   While physical activity is considered a key tool for preventing poor health, the researchers write that evidence of its effectiveness in preventing high blood pressure among African-Americans was lacking.   The 1,311 African-Americans in the study were all participating in the Jackson Heart Study. When they enrolled in the study, none of them had high blood pressure. Their physical activity levels were recorded when they first entered the study between 2000 and 2004, and they were reexamined for high blood pressure between 2005 and 2008 and again between 2009 and 2013. Half the people in the study were tracked by the research team for at least eight years.   High blood pressure is typically diagnosed when the top number reaches 140 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and the bottom number reaches 90 mmHG. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends people keep their blood pressure below 120/80 mmHg.   About half of the participants were diagnosed with high blood pressure over the course of the study.   Compared to people who hadn’t been taking part in physical activities at the start of the study, those who were getting an intermediate amount (less than 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity exercise) were 16 percent less likely to develop high blood pressure later, the researchers found.   Those getting 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity exercise or at least 75 minutes of vigorous exercise were 24 percent less likely to have developed high blood pressure than people who didn’t exercise.   The most beneficial type of exercise was physical activity from sports and exercise - not from home- or work-related tasks like housekeeping or physical labor.   Diaz told Reuters Health that physical activity related to work at home or on the job may not increase heart rates enough or for a long enough period of time to be beneficial.   Dr. Ernesto Schiffrin, a spokesperson for the AHA, said a good suggestion is for people to do something like taking brisk walks to meet the 150 minute minimum.   “So it’s 30 minutes most days of the week,” said Schiffrin, who wasn’t involved with the new study but is physician-in-chief at Sir Mortimer B. Davis-Jewish General Hospital in Montreal.   Exercise should be used in conjunction with other recommendations, he said, including a healthy diet and low salt intake.   “These are not difficult to implement,” said Schiffrin. “Managing time of course is important and more or less difficult for some people, but the benefits are probably huge.”   The researchers caution that the study’s findings are limited. For example, participants may have inaccurately reported their amounts of physical activity. Additionally, the findings are drawn from a single population of people in one U.S. community, and their exercise habits were only measured at one point in time.  "
2kb2TQi,2017-01-28,Elderly face increased disability risk after emergency room visit," Elderly patients who get treated for illnesses or injuries in the emergency department (ED) are at risk of increased disability for up to six months afterward, a recent study suggests.   To look at how ED visits might relate to functioning once patients go home, researchers examined data on 754 elderly patients who went to the ED without being admitted to the hospital and another 813 similar people who didn’t visit the ED.   At the start of the study, they had comparable functional abilities, with both groups scoring fairly low on a disability scale. But those who had an ED visit scored an average of 14 percent higher on the same scale over the next six months, researchers report in the Annals of Emergency Medicine.    “The higher risk of disability following emergency department visits is likely related to the illness or injury that led these patients to seek care in the emergency department,” said study co-author Dr. William Fleischman, an emergency medicine researcher at the University of Maryland in Baltimore.    “This does not mean that these patients should have avoided the emergency department or that they should have been hospitalized,” Fleischman, who completed the study as a researcher at Yale University, added by email. “Rather, it suggests that older adults who are medically appropriate for discharge from the emergency department may benefit from the kind of discharge planning that often occurs in the inpatient setting.”   For the 14-year study, participants completed home-based assessments every 18 months and were also interviewed monthly to reassess their functional status, identify any illnesses or injuries leading to ED visits or hospitalizations and identity nursing home admissions and deaths.    Participants were about 84 years old on average when they joined the study, and they were all living in the community, not in institutional settings like nursing homes or assisted living facilities.    Disability was measured on a scale of zero to 13, with higher scores indicating poorer functioning on basic tasks of daily living like dressing and walking, as well as more complex tasks like meal preparation, driving and managing finances.    In addition to rising disability scores, researchers found that people who had ED visits were more than three times as likely as those who didn’t to be admitted to nursing homes within the next six months, and they were almost twice as likely to die.    People who were admitted to the hospital after an ED visit tended to fare even worse.   Hospitalized patients’ average disability scores were 17 percent higher than scores of patients seen in the ED and sent home, the study found. These hospitalized patients also had the highest risk of nursing home admissions and death.    One limitation of the study is that it only included patients insured by one health plan in a small urban area, which may limit how similar the findings would be for people in other parts of the U.S. or with other types of medical coverage, the authors point out.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether ED visits or hospital admissions directly cause a decline in functioning for elderly people, or why, the authors also note.    Still the results should be a red flag to watch elderly patients closely when they’re sent home from the ED or the hospital, said Dr. Amy Kelley, a geriatrics researcher at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.    “Older adults and their families can do their best to manage chronic health conditions in partnership with their doctors and ask for additional services such as home care or palliative care for symptom management in an attempt to avoid the need for ED visits when possible,” Kelley, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “After an ED visit, they can work with their healthcare providers to optimize physical function, add needed support at home and continuing discussions to ensure that the individual’s personal priorities are always the true focus of the healthcare plan,” Kelley added.

2iQDZlo,2017-01-27,Stronger malpractice laws may not prevent surgical complications,"  (This Jan. 13 story corrects spelling of Mello, from Mellow, in paragraphs 12 and 13)   By Lisa Rapaport   (Reuters Health) - More aggressive malpractice climates don’t necessarily protect patients from surgical complications, a new study suggests   Supporters of medical malpractice laws that make it easier for patients to sue doctors say these protections are necessary to improve care. But in the current study, the risk of litigation didn’t translate into better outcomes, said study leader Dr. Karl Bilimoria, director of the Surgical Outcomes and Quality Improvement Center at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.   “It doesn’t really work – malpractice environment doesn’t influence doctors to provide better care,” Bilimoria said by email. “Rather, it may lead to defensive medicine practices where more tests and treatments are ordered unnecessarily just to try to minimize malpractice risk.”   Bilimoria and colleagues examined state-specific data on medical malpractice insurance premiums, average award size and the number of claims for every 100 physicians in each state as of 2010.    They also examined 2010 data on the odds of death, complications or repeat operations within 30 days surgery for patients insured by fee-for-service Medicare, the U.S. health program for the elderly and disabled.    The study included data on about 890,000 Medicare members who received care at almost 3,200 hospitals nationwide. Half were at least 74 years old.    During the study period, the average annual malpractice premium for general surgeons was roughly $47,000.    More aggressive malpractice laws and larger malpractice awards did not reduce patients’ risk for any of the postoperative complications studied, the researchers report in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons. No individual state malpractice law was consistently associated with improved post-operative outcomes.   Instead, in states where doctors faced greater risk from malpractice claims, patients were 22 percent more likely to develop sepsis, a potentially life-threatening bloodstream infection, the study found.    Patients in states where doctors had the most litigation risk were also 9 percent more likely to develop pneumonia, 15 percent more likely to suffer acute kidney failure and 18 percent more likely to have gastrointestinal bleeding.    The study can’t prove how specific laws cause specific outcomes, the authors note. It’s also not clear from the results whether patient outcomes led to certain state laws or if the reverse was true, and certain state policy shifts created different outcomes for patients.    Still, the results add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that tort reforms aren’t associated with better outcomes, said Michelle Mello, a law professor at Stanford University in California who wasn’t involved in the study.    “This study contributes further evidence that liability pressure doesn’t spur doctors to get better results for patients, but neither does adopting reforms to limit liability,” Mello said by email.    It’s not surprising that the study didn’t find a consistent link between malpractice environment and surgical complications because these associations can be specific to certain procedures or fields within medicine, said Dr. William Sage, a law and medicine professor at the University of Texas at Austin who wasn’t involved in the study.    “The only things that are really clear are that too many patients are injured, too few of those receive compensation, and the whole process is slow and miserable for both physicians and patients,” Sage said by email. “We also know that tort reforms capping damages at low amounts discourage most people from suing because lawyers won’t take the cases, which in turn reduces the malpractice insurance premiums that physicians pay – both of which are pretty obvious.”     Some previous research suggests that one type of law, that compares doctors’ results against national averages, can help improve outcomes in below-average states, said Dr. Anupam Jena, a researcher at Harvard University in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Changing the standards against which physicians are judged, either by ensuring that all states adopt national standard laws, or using administrative courts that hold physicians to a pre-specified clinical standard, are ways that I think the malpractice system can be leveraged to improve quality,” Jena said by email.

A patient takes a blood glucose test during an event aimed to help people with diabetes to cope with their illness at Saint Luka diagnostics medical center in Sofia, November 13, 2012.  REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov       Ketone monitoring is particularly important when patients with type 1 diabetes are sick or have consistently high glucose levels, the authors write in Diabetes Care.   “Ketones occur when the body burns fat instead of using carbohydrates for fuel,” lead author Anastasia Albanese-O’Neill told Reuters Health by email.   “If high glucose levels and ketones remain untreated, there is an increased risk for a life-threatening condition called diabetic ketoacidosis, which requires hospitalization,” said Albanese-O’Neill, a pediatrics researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville.   Dangerously high ketone levels can happen to anyone with diabetes, though the problem is rare in people with type 2, according to the American Diabetes Association.   People with type 1 diabetes have lost the ability to produce any insulin, so ketones can occur when insulin doses are missed, or when the body’s insulin requirements rise due to stress or illness, she said.   “Monitoring for ketones as recommended allows for early detection and treatment. Ketone testing supplies are available over the counter without a prescription at a local pharmacy and online,” Albanese-O’Neill said.   About 5 percent of people with diabetes have type 1, according to the American Diabetes Association.   Type 1 diabetes is most commonly diagnosed in young kids, and for that reason it used to be called juvenile diabetes. But the disease does not go away, and it can also be first diagnosed in adulthood. While children usually have caregivers to help them manage the disease, adults typically need to manage it themselves.    Part of that management is regularly testing urine or blood for high levels of ketones. To see how well patients keep up with this requirement, researchers examined data from about 3,000 people who answered an online questionnaire    Participants included parents of children 4 to 12 years old and adults aged 18 to 89.    More than 60 percent of participants had urine ketone testing kits at home and 18 percent had blood ketone monitors, researchers found. But about one third of the respondents did not have any ketone testing supplies in their homes at the time of the survey.     If cost or other factors are a barrier to obtaining supplies, these need to be identified and remedied, Albanese-O’Neill said.   Overall, 30 percent of the study participants said they never checked for ketones, and 20 percent said they rarely checked. Young kids were more likely to have been tested for ketones compared to adults.    “If they are uncertain when they should be checking for ketones, or don’t know how to test, they should ask their diabetes care team for additional education and training. This is a fundamental diabetes self-management skill for people with type 1 diabetes,” Albanese-O’Neill said.   Diabetes care providers and educators should never assume their patients with type 1 diabetes know the proper protocol for ketone monitoring, she added.   “Some may have been diagnosed before ketone testing was the standard of care, others may never have been taught, and still others may have been so overwhelmed with the diagnosis that the knowledge was lost,” Albanese-O’Neill said.   The diabetes care team has the opportunity during routine visits to evaluate patients’ understanding of ketone monitoring, and provide education and training as needed, she said.   “Somewhere around 1 in 300 or 400 children in the United States develop type 1 diabetes,” said Dr. Michael Gottschalk, associate director of the Pediatric Diabetes Research Center at the University of California, San Diego, who wasn’t involved in the study.    There has been a steady 3 percent annual increase in the number of cases in Europe and the U.S. over the last decade, if not longer, he added.    Gottschalk thinks parents are good at checking ketones in their young children. “But when it gets to adolescence that becomes an issue just in terms of compliance, and it seems that obviously, adults are no better or even worse than the adolescents,” he said.

2kCpsdv,2017-01-27,Alternative medicine might help treat premature ejaculation," (Reuters Health) - Complementary and alternative medicine options may help men manage premature ejaculation, according to a new review of existing research.   The improvements were small, and the studies were of varying quality, but preliminary evidence suggests that acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Ayurvedic herbal medicine and a Korean topical cream may all have desirable effects, researchers conclude in the journal Sexual Medicine.   “There are a range of treatments available for premature ejaculation, including drug treatments, behavioral techniques and counseling, however, some men may not want to visit the doctor, take drugs long-term or be on a long wait list for counseling,” said lead author Katy Cooper of the University of Sheffield in the UK.   “It’s important to evaluate the evidence for other therapies,” she told Reuters Health by email. “To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to assess complementary and alternative medicine for premature ejaculation.”   According to the International Society for Sexual Medicine, premature ejaculation can be a lifelong problem, and this primary form of the problem is usually defined as ejaculation happening within one minute of initiating vaginal intercourse every time a man has ever had sex. A man’s “latency time” can also become reduced later in his sexual life, and this secondary form is usually defined as ejaculation within three minutes or less.   In the current study, researchers evaluated 10 randomized controlled trials that included comparisons either to another type of treatment or to a placebo, or dummy, treatment. Two studies were of acupuncture, five were of Chinese herbal medicine, one of Ayurvedic herbal medicine and two of Korean topical “severance secret” cream.    Together, the two acupuncture studies found that the treatment slightly increased intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) by about half a minute compared to placebo.    Chinese herbal medicine increased IELT by about two minutes, Ayurvedic herbal medicine increased IELT by nearly a minute and topical cream increased IELT by more than eight minutes.   In some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. For example, Chinese medicine paired with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increased IELT by two minutes longer than SSRIs alone and nearly three minutes longer than the Chinese medicine alone.    “There are no approved treatments for premature ejaculation,” said Donald Patrick, vice chair for research at the University of Washington in Seattle. “This is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,” said Patrick, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We need treatments to address it, and it should be treated with equal seriousness as erectile dysfunction.”   The prevalence of premature ejaculation is difficult to measure because of the differing definitions of the problem and some men’s reluctance to report it. Some studies suggest that between 20 and 30 percent of men report early ejaculation concerns, but the International Society for Sexual Medicine estimates that about 4 percent of men have a lifelong condition.   “Although it is not openly discussed in the media - at least not as much as erectile problems have been discussed in the post-Viagra era - numerous studies report men feel frustrated, depressed and anxious because of this problem,” said Ege Can Serefoglu of the Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.    The main limitation of the study is the underlying weakness of the studies evaluated. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the “gold standard” for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said.   In addition, the authors write, the studies are so different, it’s tough to draw conclusions about the different options. For example, the five Chinese medicine studies tested different substances, including Qilin pills, Yimusake and Uighur.    Some studies, but not all, discussed side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, mild pain and decreased libido. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.   “Nowadays, I am encountering alternative medicine-obsessed patients more than I used to, and it doesn’t make sense to argue with them about the treatment they want,” Serefoglu told Reuters Health by email. “After all, the placebo is a well-known clinical phenomenon, and some of my patients report surprisingly favorable outcomes.”  "
2ku8CO6,2017-01-27,Nearly half of breast cancer patients have severe treatment side effects,"  (This Jan. 24 story was refiled to add dropped words in paragraph 18 of this story)   By Lisa Rapaport   (Reuters Health) - Many women being treated for breast cancer suffer from severe treatment side effects even when they don’t receive chemotherapy, a recent study suggests.    For the study, researchers surveyed 1,945 women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer about the severity of seven treatment side effects: nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, pain, arm swelling, shortness of breath and breast skin irritation.    Overall, 45 percent of participants reported severe or very severe forms of at least one of these side effects. When women got chemotherapy, the odds of severe side effects were twice as high, though the side effects were just 30 percent more likely when chemo was paired with radiation.    “We did know that some of these side effects were associated with these treatments, but we did not know how severe or how common these side effects were,” said study co-author Dr. Allison Kurian, a researcher at Stanford University School of Medicine in California.    “I found it striking that nearly half of all women treated for early-stage breast cancer reported suffering toxicity that they considered severe or very severe,” Kurian added by email. “This emphasizes the prevalence and seriousness of the problem.”   Early-stage breast cancer is the most common type of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in the U.S, and it involves smaller tumors that may have spread to nearby lymph nodes but not other parts of the body.    Most early-stage breast cancer patients have surgery – either a lumpectomy that removes malignant tissue while sparing the rest of the breast or a mastectomy that removes the entire breast. After surgery, they may also get chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any remaining abnormal cells and reduce the risk of cancer coming back.   Overall, 93 percent of the women in the study experienced at least one of the seven side effects, researchers report in the journal Cancer.    Nearly one in 10 women surveyed said they made at least one unscheduled clinic visit because of side effects, and 5 percent said they went to an emergency department or hospital.    Severe swelling in the arm or skin irritation were the most common reasons for unscheduled clinic visits. Severe breathing difficulties, arm swelling, pain or diarrhea were the most common side effects that brought women to the hospital.     Most patients in the study got some type of surgery and about half of them had radiation. There were 736 women who had chemotherapy, including 217 who received this in addition to radiation.    About 29 percent of chemotherapy patients reported severe or very severe pain, compared with 19 percent of women who didn’t receive chemo.    Women who had both chemotherapy and radiation treatment were 30 percent more likely to report a severe side effect, compared to women who had only one of those treatments.    Women who had double mastectomy were twice as likely as those who had lumpectomy to report severe or very severe pain.    Severe side effects were also more common for Latina women, who were 30 percent more likely than white women to report a severe or very severe side effect.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that certain treatments directly cause specific severe side effects, the authors note. Researchers also lacked data on the timing or dosing of chemotherapy and radiation, both of which can influence the severity of side effects.    “It is intuitive that patients who have worse disease, and who therefore require more therapy, experience worse toxicity,” said Dr. Anees Chagpar, a researcher at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who wasn’t involved in the study.    Still, the results should encourage doctors to consider when patients’ treatment regimens might be able to achieve the same survival benefit with fewer side effects, Chagpar added by email.    “The treatments we have for cancer are very effective, but there is a growing recognition of the ‘collateral damage’ that can accompany these treatments,” said Dr. Shelley Hwang, a researcher at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Patients should recognize two things: first, that cancer treatments involve trade-offs; second, that some toxicities can be long-lasting,” Hwang added by email.

2jCkLR6,2017-01-26,Sitting less linked to lower risk of diabetes," (Reuters Health) - People who spend time walking or even just standing instead of sitting down may be at lower risk of diabetes, a UK study suggests.                     A man uses his phone while riding the subway in New York, U.S., August 24, 2016. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson       Previous research has linked sedentary time to type 2 diabetes, which is tied to aging and obesity and happens when the body can’t properly use insulin to convert blood sugar into energy.    For the current study, researchers asked 435 adults at risk for developing diabetes to wear activity monitors around the clock for one week to see how much time they spent sitting, standing and walking. Then they examined lab tests to see how well their bodies processed sugar and insulin.    Findings from this study “provide further encouraging evidence” that simply substituting standing for sitting throughout the day may improve markers of type 2 diabetes, said study co-author Dr. Joseph Henson, a diabetes researcher at the University of Leicester.    “However, stronger associations were observed for stepping, thus highlighting the continued importance of more intense physical activity,” Henson said by email.    Study participants were 67 years old on average. Most of them had excess fat around the midsection and were either overweight or obese, and about one third had a family history of diabetes.    Each day, participants spent an average of 9.4 hours sitting or lying down during their waking hours. This included a total of about 4.2 hours of brief periods of sitting for no more than a half hour, as well as 5.4 hours of prolonged bouts of sitting that lasted at least 30 minutes.    In addition, participants typically spent an average of 4.5 hours a day standing and 1.7 hours a day walking.    People who replaced 30 minutes of prolonged sitting time with shorter bouts of sitting had a 4 percent reduction in fasting insulin levels, researchers calculated.    If participants replaced prolonged sitting with standing, however, they had 5 percent drop in fasting insulin levels, and walking instead was associated with an 11 percent difference, researchers report in BMJ Open.    The study didn’t find an association between blood sugar or insulin levels when people swapped short periods of sitting for standing, however. Stepping instead of sitting for short periods was linked to a 7 percent drop in fasting insulin.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment and can’t prove how different activity levels directly influence the risk of diabetes, the authors note. Researchers also used statistical models to estimate how much changes in activity might impact blood sugar and insulin.   Still, the results add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that even small reductions in sedentary time may help lower the risk of diabetes, said Bethany Barone Gibbs, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Breaking up prolonged sitting with walking or standing can improve how our body takes up blood glucose,” Barone Gibbs said by email.    When the body moves, it signals muscles and cells that will need fuel and they start absorbing sugar from the blood. When people are sedentary, these signals don’t go out.    “This is why blood sugar seems to go higher if we engage in prolonged sitting versus more active behaviors after eating,” Barone Gibbs added. “If we are constantly exposed to high blood sugar over time, this can cause diabetes and cardiovascular diseases to develop.”   Even though the results mirror other studies linking reduced sedentary time to a lower diabetes risk, the use of statistical models rather than a controlled experiment makes it hard to see what would happen if people cut back on sitting in real life, said Peter Katzmarzyk of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.    “The people didn’t actually replace their sitting with physical activity, which is what would happen in an intervention,” Katzmarzyk, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email. “We need more actual interventions for us to better understand what is going on.”  "
2ko4xM0,2017-01-26,Cervical surgery for pre-cancer tied to preemies and small babies," (Reuters Health) - - Women who get surgery to treat precancerous abnormalities on their cervix are more likely to have premature or low-birth weight babies than women who don’t have these procedures, a recent study suggests.    Researchers focused on women with a common condition known as cervical dysplasia, abnormal tissue growth that is typically caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Milder cases of dysplasia may go away on their own, but doctors often surgically remove abnormal tissue in more severe cases to help prevent the condition from progressing to full-blown cervical cancer.   “Women who have already had the surgery to remove pre-cancerous lesions may want to wait a while to get pregnant, as we found the risk of pre-term birth increased even more if women gave birth within a year of their surgery,” said study co-author Allison Naleway, of the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland, Oregon.   In the study, researchers examined data on pregnancy outcomes for 4,307 women who didn’t have cervical procedures and compared them to 322 women who had surgery to remove precancerous tissue and another 847 women who had cervical biopsies to investigate abnormalities.    Women who had surgeries that cut out at least one centimeter of tissue were more than twice as likely to have preterm births or underweight babies as women who didn’t have any cervical procedures, the study found.   And when women gave birth within one year of cervical surgery, their odds of these complications more than tripled.    Compared to women who didn’t have surgery, those who did were more likely to be smokers, overweight or obese and first-time mothers.   Researchers looked at several common surgical methods for removing or destroying precancerous tissue, including excising cells with a scalpel or destroying tissue with a laser, using a thin wire loop to burn tissue with an electrical current or using a device that freezes tissue.     About 5 percent of women who had ablation procedures, typically using the wire loop, had preemies, compared with about 10 percent of women who had less than 1.6 centimeters of tissue excised with scalpels. When women had 1.6 centimeters of tissue or more cut out, 28 percent of them had preterm babies.    By way of comparison, 7 percent of women in the study who didn’t have cervical procedures had preterm babies, as did 8 percent of women who had cervical biopsies.    Women who had excision procedures cutting out at least 1 centimeter of tissue were 2.2 times more likely to have low-birthweight babies as women who had no cervical surgery or only biopsies, researchers report in PLoS ONE.   Miscarriages and stillbirths were more likely among women who had ablations, however. About 25 percent of women who had ablations experienced pregnancy loss, compared with 19 percent of women who had excision procedures and 18 percent of women who didn’t have cervical surgery or biopsy.    Cesarean deliveries were also more likely among women who had cervical surgeries, but the increased risk wasn’t big enough to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on excision thickness for some women and also didn’t have information on a variety of factors that can influence pregnancy outcomes like women’s income and education levels, marital status and type of insurance.    GlaxoSmithKline, which makes one of two HPV vaccines approved in the U.S., paid for the research and three of the authors were employees of the company at the time. A fourth author disclosed having received consulting fees from both GSK and Merck, which manufactures the other U.S.-approved HPV vaccine.   The results suggest that the actual treatment of cervical dysplasia, rather than the condition itself, is a relevant factor in increasing the risk of pregnancy complications, said Dr. Christina Chu, a gynecologic oncology researcher at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study.   “The best thing that women can do is to protect themselves against HPV infection, which is the greatest risk factor for developing cervical dysplasia,” Chu added by email. “Girls and young women should get the HPV vaccine.”   When women are treated for this condition, waiting to have a baby may make sense.    “It does appear that the risks may be less for women who deliver more than one year after excision, so if excision is necessary, women may consider delaying pregnancy to allow the cervix to heal fully,” Chu said.

2ktP6Fw,2017-01-26,Child pedestrian deaths more likely around parks," (Reuters Health) – - Child pedestrian fatalities are up to twice as likely around parks as they are around schools, according to a study based on 30 years of U.S. crash data.   Child pedestrian safety initiatives, such as the Safe Routes to School program, tend to focus on schools, but traffic risks around parks deserve more attention, the study authors write in Injury Prevention.   “Fatalities and injuries in our transportation system, especially vulnerable ones such as children and pedestrians, are a vitally important and soluble issue, yet we treat them as the price of doing business,” said lead author Nick Ferenchak, a civil engineer at the University of Colorado in Denver.    In the United States, motor vehicle collisions are the leading cause of death for young people between the ages of 5 and 24 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Every hour, about 40 children die on roads around the world, many on foot, according to the World Health Organization.    “We need to stop our practice of thinking myopically by focusing just around schools and start thinking about how we make our entire cities safer,” Ferenchak told Reuters Health by email. “This is not just a transportation issue but a planning/land use issue as well.”   Ferenchak and a coauthor looked at National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data on crashes in six cities between 1982 and 2012 for children under age 18 to identify where fatalities typically occur. Then they used GIS mapping to evaluate the quarter-mile surrounding parks to compare fatality rates to those around schools and the city as a whole.   They focused on the country’s fastest-growing regions - the South and the West - and the cities there with the largest proportionate increases in population, on the theory that new infrastructure could affect the way schools, parks and trails are included in communities.    The analysis included Austin, Dallas and Houston in Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Denver and Los Angeles, and in all six cities, fatality risk around parks was found to be 1.16 to 1.81 times that of the city overall.    Researchers also found that fatalities near parks were 1.04 to 2.23 times more common compared to the vicinity of schools, with Dallas showing the biggest difference.    “This comes at a critically important time when we’re seeing changes in U.S. transportation funding and a changing menu of options that states can choose from,” said Charles DiMaggio, an director of injury research at the New York University School of Medicine, who was not involved with the study.    “We know that enforcement and education are important, but engineering is the most expensive and effective way to protect kids,” he told Reuters Health by email. “We need, more than anything, to evaluate all of these efforts.”   One limitation of the study, the researchers acknowledge, is that specific child pedestrian exposure numbers are hard to track accurately by geographic area. They are likely to vary by age, and may vary by city.   “If you’re 5 years old, you’re likely not far from home if you get injured,” DiMaggio said. “But if you’re 14 or 15, you’re roaming more widely, which is tough to measure.”   The study team suggests that solutions to the problem lie in the realms of transportation and urban design. Just as reduced speed limits and pedestrian crossings in school zones have lowered child pedestrian injury rates, similar transportation measures around parks could reduce fatalities.   However, that won’t help in areas with major highways. In several cities studied, parks were often located near roads with four or six lanes and speeds above 70 miles per hour, Ferenchak noted. Instead, parks should be placed on slow, narrow roads in neighborhoods.    “Although I talk about expanding our considerations beyond schools, that is not a slight at the research being done around schools in the least,” he said. “We’d like to build collaborations with Safe Routes to School because they have many important findings and best practices that could be applied in parks as well.  "
2jjO7CB,2017-01-26,Frequent nighttime bathroom trips tied to higher risk of falls at all ages," (Reuters Health) - People who wake more often during the night to use the bathroom are also more likely to slip and fall, a study of Korean men suggests.   Compared to people who slept through the night without any bathroom trips, those who woke just once for the toilet on an average night were 41 percent more likely to experience falls, the study found. With three or more nightly bathroom trips, the risk of falls at least doubled.   Plenty of previous research has documented an increased risk of falling among elderly people with nocturia, or routine awakening to use the bathroom during the night. But the current study looked at men from 19 to 103 years old and suggests that even young people may not be immune to the fall risk associated with this type of sleep disruption, said senior study author Dr. Hyo Geun Choi, a researcher at Hallym University College of Medicine in Anyang, South Korea.   “Nocturia could cause falls at night because several instances of abruptly waking up to void may elevate the risk of incidental falls,” Choi said by email.    “In addition, nocturia is known to be a leading cause of sleep fragmentation in elderly individuals,” Choi added. “This disturbance or fragmentation of sleep may induce daytime sleepiness, which increases the risk of falls.”   For the current study, Choi and colleagues examined data on the history of falls in the previous year and incidents of nocturia for than 92,000 men.   Overall, almost 15 percent of the men had a history of slipping or falling, researchers report in PLoS ONE.    Among the men without any history of falls, 67 percent also had no experience with nocturia.    But 40 percent of men with slips or falls in the past had at least some experience with frequent nighttime awakenings to use the bathroom.   When researchers looked just at the subset of younger men aged 19 to 30, they still found nocturia linked to falls. For these men, four or five awakenings were associated with three times the odds of falling.   With middle-aged men, 31 to 60, four or five instances of nocturia a night were tied to slightly more than 50 percent higher odds of falling.    It’s possible that nocturnal waking might contribute to impaired attention, psychiatric problems or chronic diseases that might make falls more likely, Choi said.    Often nocturia first occurs about two or three hours after sleep begins, during a period of so-called slow wave sleep, Choi added. Waking during slow-wave sleep can impact mood during the day and may also contribute to poor blood sugar control in people with diabetes, Choi said.    Waking to urinate once in the night is not considered abnormal, according to the National Sleep Foundation, but two or more events per night is linked to daytime sleepiness. People with severe nocturia may wake five or six times during the night to go to the bathroom and the frequent need to urinate is often a symptom of another health condition, such as diabetes or prolapsed bladder.   Limitations of the study include a reliance on men to report how often they fell or experienced nocturia, as well as a lack of detailed data on when during sleep people awoke to use the bathroom.     Still, the findings offer more evidence linking nocturia to a risk of falls, said Glenn Brassington, a researcher at Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, California, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Awakening to go to the bathroom increases the opportunity for falling,” Brassington said by email.    “Frequent nighttime awakenings likely indicate that study participants are not getting sufficient deep sleep, resulting in impairments in memory, attention, coordination, and balance - all of which are related to increased incidence of falling,” Brassington added.   "
2kxgz9e,2017-01-26,Physician survey shows broad opposition to wholesale Obamacare repeal," (Reuters Health) - A survey of doctors shows overwhelming opposition to the effort by President Donald Trump and the Republican Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.   The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, show only 15 percent of 426 primary care physicians favor total repeal.   Even among doctors who said they voted for Trump, only 38 percent said they wanted the act eliminated in its entirety.   Mr. Trump has promised to replace Obamacare with something better. Neither he nor Congress have released specifics.   That might garner support from the physicians surveyed, depending on the provisions of a new plan; 74 percent favored making improvements to Obamacare. But some improvements they want may not be popular with opponents of the law.   For example, more than 66 percent of the respondents said the government should create a public option similar to Medicare to compete with private insurance. Many opponents want the government out of the healthcare business altogether.   More than half (59 percent) of the physicians surveyed supported tax credits that would allow the purchase of private insurance by people eligible for Medicaid, the federally-financed but state-run health insurance program for the poor.   Nearly 69 percent favored increasing the use of health savings accounts.   In contrast, only 29 percent supported increasing the use of high-deductible health plans, a proposal being floated around to keep down government costs, and fewer than half of the physicians (43 percent) said Medicare should be expanded to cover people aged 55 to 64.   Some Republican proposals have called for deregulating the private insurance industry, a move that would allow companies to sell health plans across state lines. Only 42 percent of physicians supported that idea.   The primary care physicians were almost evenly split on the idea of requiring all states to expand Medicaid under the auspices of Obamacare, a controversial concept. Many states with Republican governors have refused to do so.   But the provisions of the law that are most popular with the public are very popular with the first-line physicians as well.   Just over 95 percent said it was somewhat or very important to prohibit insurance companies from denying coverage or charging more for people with preexisting conditions, which companies were allowed to do before Obamacare.   Support levels among the physicians were nearly 88 percent for allowing children up to age 26 to be covered on their parents’ insurance plan, 91 percent for providing tax credits to small businesses and 73 percent for expanding Medicaid for the poor.   “I do think it’s striking that even among doctors who said they voted for Donald Trump for president, only about a third - 38 percent - supported repealing the ACA in its entirety,” study coauthor Dr. Craig Pollack, an associate professor of general internal medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, told Reuters Health.   Only 32 percent of doctors who said they were Republicans favored complete repeal. The rate among Democrats was zero.   The survey was done by mail in December and January. The response rate was 45 percent.   It focused on primary care physicians, a group that includes family practitioners, pediatricians and internal medicine specialists because “they’re on the front line trying to advocate for their patients,” Pollack said.   In contrast, a survey done by The Kaiser Family Foundation and the Commonwealth Fund during the first quarter of 2015, a year and a half after the botched rollout of the Obamacare enrollment website, found that 52 percent of primary care physicians had an unfavorable view of the law while 48 percent viewed Obamacare favorably.   Political debate over the subject of physician support has been the subject of a lot of hype. For example, in 2012, Republican lawmakers were claiming that 83 percent of doctors were considering leaving the profession because of Obamacare. That claim was based on a survey by a group founded to oppose the law.   PolitiFact, the fact-checking website, ruled the claim false because the survey never directly asked doctors if Obamacare had sparked thoughts of quitting medicine.  "
2k1ncQi,2017-01-25,Parenting help for dads tied to better school readiness for kids," (Reuters Health) - A reading program designed to help men become better fathers is associated with better parenting skills as well as behavior and learning improvements in kids, a small study suggests.    In the study, researchers focused on fathers and kids at Head Start centers in New York City, where programs are designed to improve school readiness for children under age 5 with education, healthcare and social services.    Researchers randomly assigned 126 families to either participate in a reading-based parenting program with eight weekly sessions or join a control group of people on a waiting list for the program.   “We found that our program supported positive changes in fathers’ behavior, children’s language skills, and children’s behavior in comparison to families who did not participate in the program,” said lead study author Anil Chacko, a psychology researcher at New York University.   Even though fathers play a significant role in the social, emotional and behavioral development of children, much of the previous research on parenting programs to improve kids’ behavior and learning abilities has focused on mothers, Chacko added by email.    “Our study did not compare the effects of book exposure or mother-child versus father-child reading interactions, but we did use reading with fathers as a specific situation to have fathers practice father-child interactions that support children’s positive behavior and reduce risk for behavior problems while also fostering children’s literacy skills,” Chacko said.    “We found that fathers engaged well in the program and saw benefits, and the program was feasible to deliver in Head Start with staff in the center being the ones who delivered the intervention,” Chacko added.    For the study, fathers in the parenting program watched videos showing dads reading with children but with exaggerated errors. The fathers in the program discussed better approaches to these interactions with kids in groups, and then they were encouraged to practice these strategies when reading at home with their own kids.    Among other things, the program tried to improve parenting skills such as establishing consistent routines, spending time with kids doing things children choose. The program also encouraged dads to use praise and rewards to promote good behavior and use distraction or reduced attention to discourage negative behavior.   Compared to kids with dads who didn’t join the program, children with fathers in the program had significantly bigger improvements in behavior and language development during the study period, researchers report in the Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology.     Fathers in the program also reported improved discipline approaches and promotion of their children’s psychological growth by the end of the study.    When researchers observed how dads’ interactions with kids changed after the program, they found fathers made fewer critical statements to their children and used more positive parenting behaviors like praise and affection.    Overall, researchers estimate that the program was associated with a more than 30 percent improvement in parenting and school readiness outcomes.   Beyond its small size, another limitation of the study is the lack of follow-up data to see if the program had a lasting effect on fathers or kids after the parenting help ended, the authors note.    The type of shared book reading used in the program may work well with preschoolers but not with older kids, Chacko said.    Still, the study suggests that approaches previously tested to help mothers improve parenting can also help fathers, said Dr. Caroline Kistin, a pediatrics researcher at Boston University who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Shared reading supports child cognitive development, but probably more importantly, helps children develop the ability to pay attention and cooperate,” Kistin said by email. “For these social-emotional skills, the shared experience – sitting close together, pointing out pictures, making connections between the book and daily life - are critical.”  "
2koLS1X,2017-01-24,Federal program cuts disparities in HIV/AIDS care," (Reuters Health) - When Gina Brown was diagnosed with HIV in 1994, she considered it a death sentence, but nearly 23 years later, she’s living a full life in New Orleans, thanks largely to the federally funded Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.   In 2014, the safety-net program provided drugs, medical care and support services to more than 268,000 people in the U.S. living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Now a study shows that in 82 percent of them, including Brown, HIV is no longer detectable in their blood – a state known as “viral suppression.”    Those who are virally suppressed take antiretroviral medications that allow them to expect to live a nearly average lifespan. In addition, the drugs can virtually eliminate the possibility of transmitting the virus to others.    The number of Ryan White program participants who achieved viral suppression rose 12 percent from 2010 until 2014, researchers found. The study considered only those who used the program for medical care and were at least 13 years old.   Senior author Dr. Laura Cheever hailed the increase as a “huge improvement.” She is the associate administrator of the federal Health Resource and Service Administration’s HIV/AIDS Bureau in Rockville, Maryland.   Named for a boy who was expelled from school at age 13 following a 1984 diagnosis with HIV, the Ryan White program has offered healthcare and other services – from drugs to temporary housing to counseling, substance-abuse treatment and rides to medical appointments – to HIV-positive people since 1990.    The program cost $2.3 billion this fiscal year and is expected to serve more than 500,000 people, about half the number of Americans diagnosed with HIV, Cheever said.    The viral suppression rate rose even higher for program participants who received medical care in 2015 – to more than 83 percent, Cheever said in a phone interview. Some participants receive just support services, not medical care, and were not included in the viral suppression number.   From 2010 to 2014, disparities between suppression rates for those in vulnerable groups shrank, the report in Health Affairs found.    The gap in viral suppression rates for blacks narrowed in comparison to whites; the gap for adolescents and youth adults narrowed in comparison to those for older adults; and the gap for HIV-positive people living in the South narrowed in comparison to people in other regions of the U.S.    Disparities persisted, but were significantly reduced for every group except homeless and transgender people, Cheever said.    Brown, 51, a black woman living in the South, has been a beneficiary of the program’s equal access, and she sees it as her salvation.    “The Ryan White program allows us to live,” she said in a phone interview.    The program enabled Brown to earn a master’s degree in social work, and she now works in the HIV testing and prevention program at the Institute of Women and Ethnic Studies in New Orleans.   Most importantly, Brown said, the program has introduced her to other HIV-positive people. “You can hang out with women just like you and not feel stigmatized and not feel so alone,” she said.   The Ryan White program reduces disparities for vulnerable groups that persist for other diseases throughout the U.S., Cheever said.   “The paper demonstrates that by taking a public health approach to a complicated medical condition, we can really serve the people in this country who have limited access to care,” she said.    Dr. Michael Saag directs the University of Alabama at Birmingham AIDS Center and was not involved in the new research. The study’s findings mirror what he’s seen in his clinic and present “evidence that when you give people ready and equal access to care, healthcare disparities disappear,” Saag said in a phone interview.    “Why is it that health disparities are substantially less with HIV? The answer is it’s because of the Ryan White Care Act,” he said. “These are the healthcare disparities we’re so used to, that we expect. And that’s a tragedy.”   Under the Ryan White program, financial status no longer limits access to care because the program fills whatever holes people with HIV have in their healthcare coverage and in their related needs.   “You could almost think of it as an experiment in single payer because it creates relatively equal access to all people, regardless of their station in life,” Saag said. Because people who are virally suppressed don’t transmit HIV, he said, the program benefits not only individuals but the general public.   Before the Affordable Care Act was enacted, only about 13 percent of HIV-positive people in the U.S. had private health insurance, and 24 percent had no coverage at all, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.    Ryan White died at age 18, just months before Congress passed the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act.  "
2jhSW2H,2017-01-23,Researchers credit Obamacare with helping find early-stage cancer," (Reuters Health) - The Affordable Care Act likely extended the lives of thousands of seniors who took advantage of free screening exams and were diagnosed with treatable, early-stage colorectal cancer, a new study suggests.                    FILE PHOTO - The federal government forms for applying for health coverage are seen at a rally held by supporters of the Affordable Care Act, widely referred to as ""Obamacare"", outside the Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center in Jackson, Mississippi, U.S. on October 4, 2013.  REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman/File Photo       “I think the prevention-related provisions of the Affordable Care Act helped to detect cancer at earlier and more treatable stages and eventually will save lives,” said senior author Nengliang “Aaron” Yao, a health-policy professor at the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville.   Before the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, took effect, people ages 65 and older who were insured under Medicare had to pay $275 for colonoscopies, the report in Health Affairs says.    The Affordable Care Act (ACA) directed that colonoscopies be offered for free.   From 2011, when the law took effect, until 2013, an additional 8,400 seniors, or 8 percent more than before, were diagnosed with early-stage colorectal cancer, researchers estimated.    “The study does a very nice job of showing that when you remove financial barriers to healthcare, health improves,” said Dr. Cary Gross, a professor at the Yale School of Medicine, in New Haven, Connecticut who was not involved in the study. “When the Affordable Care Act granted more generous coverage, we were more likely to detect cancer at an earlier stage.”   “This shows that when it comes to creating a new healthcare plan, the devil’s in the details, and policymakers need to look at things like how will the proposed changes affect cancer screening,” Gross said in a phone interview.    Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of U.S. cancer-related deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. Nearly 52,000 Americans died from colorectal cancer in 2013.    Though research shows that screening reduces the risk of dying from colorectal cancer, only 25 percent of uninsured people and 60 percent of insured people had been screened as recommended, a 2015 CDC study showed.    Both Yao and Gross would like President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have pledged to repeal the ACA, to consider the ramifications of the new study before ruling on future healthcare legislation.   “I’m very concerned that policymakers who are trying to save money by not covering cancer-prevention services are being penny-wise and pound-foolish,” Gross said. “They may save money today, but we will be paying a lot more taking care of patients with metastatic cancer down the road.”   “I’m worried on behalf of our patients and our communities that these great strides we’ve made against cancer will evaporate if the important provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which ensure that patients can access cancer screening services without additional costs, are taken away,” he said.   In the new study, researchers examined data from 18 cancer registries across the U.S. They found no change in the number of Medicare early-stage cancer diagnoses for breast cancer between the period before Obamacare, from 2008 until 2010, until the period after, from 2011 until 2013.   Mammography to screen for breast cancer became free for Medicare patients under the ACA, but before that, it cost just $9 – a significantly smaller financial barrier than the $275 cost of a colonoscopy, Yao said in a phone interview.   In addition, breast cancer screening had been marketed more successfully than colorectal screening before the ACA was enacted, he said.   Gross noted that colonoscopies can actually prevent cancer, because doctors can remove polyps during the procedure, whereas mammograms only allow doctors to see growths in the breast.   The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force found convincing evidence that colorectal cancer screening substantially reduces deaths in adults between 50 and 75 years old, it said last year. The task force recommended screening with colonoscopy, stool analyses or flexible sigmoidoscopy combined with a fecal-occult blood test.    The new study could not determine the impact of free colonoscopies on metastatic colorectal cancer rates or mortality from colorectal cancer. Gross urged follow-up studies examining those numbers after they become available.  "
2ifBGbp,2017-01-20,Heartburn pills tied to serious bacterial infections," (Reuters Health) - People who take popular heartburn pills known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may be more likely to develop intestinal infections than people who don’t take these medications, a Scottish study suggests.    The pills work by stopping cells in the stomach lining from producing too much of the acid that can cause ulcers and reflux symptoms such as heartburn.   Researchers examined data on about 188,000 people who used these drugs and about 377,000 similar individuals who didn’t take PPIs. Compared to people who didn’t use the drugs, those who did were at higher risk for a severe form of diarrhea caused by the Clostridium difficile bacteria. Their odds of this infection were 1.4 times higher when they were hospitalized and 1.7 times higher when they weren’t in the hospital.    In addition, PPI users had a 4.5 times greater risk of getting Campylobacter infections, a common form of food poisoning, if they were hospitalized and a 3.7 times higher risk when they weren’t hospitalized.    “Reducing stomach acid, which acts as a barrier to infection, increases the chance of getting a GI infection,” said senior study author Dr. Thomas MacDonald, a pharmacology researcher at the University of Dundee in Scotland.    “The main risk of PPIs are gastrointestinal infections,” MacDonald added by email.    MacDonald and colleagues analyzed data on stool samples collected from patients in Scotland between 1999 and 2013.   Overall, there were 22,705 positive test results for bacterial infections. This included 15,273 people with C. difficile and 6,590 cases of Campylobacter, the authors reported in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology.    Researchers also tested for Salmonella, Shigella and Escherichia coli, or E. coli, but didn’t find an association between PPIs and these infections.    One limitation of the study is that it only included data on people who took PPIs with a prescription, even though these drugs have been available in Scotland since 2004 without a prescription, the authors note. Researchers also lacked data on other factors that can influence the risk of bacterial infections such as obesity, smoking and alcohol use.    Previous research on PPIs and infections has produced mixed results, with some studies suggesting an association and others failing to establish a connection, noted Dr. Wojciech Marlicz, a gastroenterology researcher at Pomeranian Medical University in Poland who wasn’t involved in the study.    Millions of people worldwide take PPIs, which are available without a prescription in Europe and the U.S., which means even a slight increase in the odds of bacterial infections can still impact a lot of patients.    “The main problem with PPI use is their general overuse,” Marlicz said by email. “These drugs are very potent and safe when used according to indication.”   “Some patients will gain clear benefits from PPIs as they have stomach problems, such as ulcers which will heal better with less acid,” said Dr. Claire Steves, a researcher at King’s College London who wasn’t involved in the study.    “However other patients may take these as preventatives, or for mild symptoms,” Steves added by email. “This study would prompt us to reassess the risk and benefit for each individual, and in some cases alternatives – such as changing diet or lifestyle – may be better options.”  "
2jgIUfK,2017-01-20,Preterm birth linked to health problems in adolescence," (Reuters Health) - Adolescents who were born extremely premature are much more likely to have chronic health problems than their peers who were delivered at full term, a Swedish study suggests.     Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born after 37 weeks are considered full term. The study focused on extremely preterm infants, delivered at 23 to 25 weeks gestation.   In the weeks immediately after birth, these early arrivals often have difficulty breathing and digesting food. They can also encounter longer-term challenges such as impaired vision, hearing, and cognitive skills as well as social and behavioral problems.   “Children born extremely preterm at 23 to 25 weeks gestation face an increased risk of chronic health problems such as neurodevelopmental handicap (mostly mild or moderate), asthma, and behavioral difficulties,” said study co-author Dr. Aijaz Farooqi, a researcher at the University Hospital of Umea in Sweden.    “At school age, many extremely preterm children whose general intelligence is normal or in the lower normal range have motor impairments, behavioral problems, social problems and academic underachievement,” Farooqi added by email.    Farooqi’s team studied 134 youngsters ages 10 to 15 who were born extremely preterm, plus 103 children who were full-term infants but otherwise similar.    Compared to the full-term group, adolescents in the preemie group were 15 times more likely to have severe physical or mental impairments and more than five times as likely to require more medical or educational services than children typically need, the study found.    Overall, 64 percent of the preemies in the study had functional limitations, compared with 6 percent of the full-term teens, researchers report in Pediatrics.    This included mental or emotional developmental delays as well as an inability to play and socialize.    In addition, 60 percent of the adolescents who were preterm infants needed special equipment or assistance to complete daily tasks like walking, feeding, dressing and using the bathroom, compared to just 29 percent of the teens who were born full-term.    Roughly 64 percent of the teens born preterm needed routine care from a physician or specialist for a chronic health problems or special services like physical or occupational therapy, nursing care or special school arrangements. That was true for 25 percent of other kids in the study.    Even though the study didn’t examine what factors might cause problems for extremely preterm babies who survive to adolescence, disruptions in brain and central nervous system development may be part of the problem, Farooqi said.    The study was small and it wasn’t designed to see how birth timing influences health in adolescence, however.   Complications that are common in extremely preterm infants, such as central nervous system injuries, lung disease, eye problems and infections, “have been shown to be related to many of the chronic health problems” Farooqi noted.    Still, there are things parents can do for preemies that may make a difference later on, said Dr. Jill Zwicker, a researcher at the University of British Columbia in Canada who wasn’t involved in the study.    “When deemed safe to do so, parents can help their babies by holding them skin-to-skin while in the nursery, which is mutually beneficial for parents and babies,” Zwicker said by email.    “Throughout childhood, parents can support their child’s development by providing enriching opportunities for learning - reading to them, providing opportunities to move and play, exploring the environment, engaging with other children - and so on,” Zwicker added. “Early developmental intervention, such as occupational and physical therapy, can also improve outcomes.”  "
2hww6B9,2017-01-19,Far fewer men being treated for prostate cancer," (Reuters Health) - The number of older Americans treated for prostate cancer plummeted 42 percent since health officials began questioning the benefits of screening tests, a new study shows.   The finding points to the success of efforts to curtail the use of controversial prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, screening tests, said lead author Dr. Tudor Borza.   At the same time, his team found, doctors still face challenges trying to convince men diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer to watch and wait before undergoing surgery or other invasive treatment, Borza said.   From 2007 to 2012, Medicare data showed a relatively meager 8 percent drop in the number of men who were treated immediately after a prostate cancer diagnosis, Borza’s team reports in Health Affairs.    Borza, a urologist and research fellow at the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor, said he feared the statistics might mean that too few men are being screened, and among those who do get a prostate cancer diagnosis, too few are following the strategy of watchful waiting and surveillance recommended by urologists for early-stage tumors.    “I believe more men should be screened,” Borza said in a phone interview. “A diagnosis of prostate cancer shouldn’t necessarily lead to treatment.”   A PSA test measures the amount of a protein known as prostate-specific antigen in a man’s blood. Often, however, the test falsely signals possible cancer, causing anxiety and leading to unnecessary, invasive and sometimes debilitating procedures.   Moreover, many men are likely to die of other causes before slow-growing prostate cancer harms them. But once they’ve been diagnosed with prostate cancer, men frequently elect to be treated and can suffer punishing side effects, including impotence and incontinence.   “Diagnosis has a way of begetting treatment, whether or not it warrants treatment,” said Dr. Gilbert Welch, professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in Lebanon, New Hampshire. He was not involved with the new study.   “Patients think once cancer is there, you’ve got to act,” Welch said in a phone interview. “The question is whether you want to be looking for early forms of cancer.”   Borza and Welch both believe the decision should be left to individual men. But the two physicians approach the question from differing perspectives. Borza’s interest in continuing to screen men for prostate cancer with PSA tests generally aligns with other urologists, and Welch’s preference for less screening aligns with other primary-care physicians.   In 2008, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) advised against routine PSA testing of men older than 75. By 2011, the government-backed panel of independent physicians recommended against all PSA screening, warning that the benefits do not outweigh the harms.   The American Urological Association, however, recommends that men weigh the benefits and harms of PSA screening in conversations with their doctors and finds the greatest value to screening in 55 to 69 year olds.    Borza and his team analyzed Medicare data and identified more than 67,000 men age 66 and older who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2007 and 2012. During the same period, the population-based rate for men treated for prostate cancer dropped 42 percent, from 4.3 per 100,000 men to 2.5 per 100,000, the study shows.   Nearly three-quarters of the men diagnosed with prostate cancer had curative treatment, such as surgery or radiation, within a year, while 17 percent instead opted for “watchful waiting” or “active surveillance,” the study found.   Most of the men diagnosed with prostate cancer were between 66 and 75 years old, but nearly 16 percent were 80 and older - too old to likely benefit from treatment, according to the USPSTF guidelines.   Men are much more likely to die with prostate cancer than from it, Welch said.   “The question is whether you want to be looking for early forms of cancer,” he said. “There’s no limit to how much data we can collect, but that doesn’t mean we want all that information. It can lead people down a rabbit hole.”   Borza sees it differently.   “Information is power,” he said. “Knowing where you stand allows you to make the best decisions.”   Nonetheless, he acknowledges that deciding whether and how to treat an early-stage prostate cancer diagnosed after a PSA test can be an agonizing decision. And no one can say how many lives might be saved by treating those cancers.    Borza recommends men consider getting PSA tests at 50 years old. But, he said, “It is a very difficult decision for a man to make. There’s not a great answer.”  "
2iY0c3K,2017-01-19,"Olympic athletes have heart problems, too"," (Reuters Health) - Some Olympic athletes could be at risk while training and competing because of heart defects or dysfunction that they may not even know about, Italian researchers say.                    The Olympics rings logo is pictured in Lausanne, Switzerland, June 21, 2016. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse       About 4 percent of the Italian athletes studied over a 10-year period with MRI and CT scans as well as electrocardiograms (ECG) had cardiovascular disorders – a higher proportion than researchers expected to find.   “Even though it’s a small percentage with abnormalities, the implications can be huge,” said lead author Dr. Antonio Pelliccia, scientific director of the Institute of Sports Medicine of the Italian National Olympic Committee in Rome. “Athletes may be healthy, but they may not be safe from certain risks such as sudden death syndrome.”   Pelliccia and colleagues looked at screening results for more than 2,300 athletes during the period between the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens and the 2014 games in Sochi, Russia. As part of the heart screening process, the Italian medical team incorporates medical history, a physical exam, an ECG and an echocardiogram.    They found that 92 athletes had abnormal results, including inherited heart problems, coronary artery disease, hypertension, electrical diseases such as atrial fibrillation and tachycardias. The research team didn’t see a major difference based on the type of sport played.   Overall, nine of 92 athletes with cardiac abnormalities were disqualified from competitive sport and 17 had temporary restrictions until the abnormalities were resolved. For many of the athletes, however, these abnormalities don’t show any symptoms and may not affect performance either, the study authors write in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.    About 60 percent had valvular problems, which didn’t prompt conversations about disqualification for future sport participation, they write.    “Not all abnormalities are diseases, and not all are concerning,” Pelliccia said. “Valvular abnormalities in young people, for instance, are treatable and don’t represent a real limitation.”   Since 2009, the Italian National Olympic Committee has required periodic evaluation of elite athletes. Few international groups - only the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) - require screenings, the authors note. In fact, no medical evaluation was universally required for athletes until the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympic Games, they write.   Italy’s screening process, particularly with mandated electrocardiograms, has been among the most vigorous in recent years, said Dr. Douglas Zipes, a professor of cardiology at Indiana University School of Medicine in Indianapolis, who wasn’t involved with the study.    “Their required ECGs have reduced sudden deaths and encouraged the rest of the world to follow suit,” Zipes told Reuters Health. “But the rest of the world still asks questions about the benefits, costs and effectiveness of requiring it.”   The study also points out false negatives from the screenings during the decade, said Dr. Kimberly Harmon, head football physician at the University of Washington in Seattle, who wasn’t involved with the study. Many of the abnormalities may have been present at previous screenings but didn’t lead to a diagnosis because of inconclusive results or incorrect interpretation of the results.   “Screening for these conditions is important to prevent sudden cardiac death,” she told Reuters Health by email. “The currently recommended history and physical is unlikely to discover many of these conditions, so advanced screening may be required to detect them.”     Despite concerns, sudden death in athletes is still quite rare, Zipes noted, with fewer than 100 sudden deaths occurring in U.S. athletes annually. That compares to more than 300,000 annual sudden deaths in the general U.S. population, according to a 2014 American Heart Association report.   “We make a big deal out of these deaths because of the emotional impact, especially among professional and Olympic athletes who represent the epitome of health,” he said.    The study makes a statement about the potential for cardiovascular abnormalities in everyday athletes as well - but shouldn’t cause alarm, he said.    “Exercise is beneficial, whether you achieve Olympic status or are a weekend warrior,” Zipes said. “Ultimately, whatever you like to do, exercise is helpful for the heart.”  "
2k7nWUz,2017-01-19,Seeing e-cigarettes may boost desire to smoke," (Reuters Health) - - Newer versions of e-cigarettes known as vape pens may not look much like traditional cigarettes, but seeing someone use these devices still sparks a desire to smoke, a recent study suggests.                     A customer prepares to try a Philip Morris' ""iQOS"" smokeless tobacco e-cigarette at an iQOS store in Tokyo, Japan, March 3, 2016.   REUTERS/Toru Hanai        Like other types of e-cigarettes, vaporizers, or vape pens, are battery-powered gadgets with a heating element that turns liquid nicotine and flavorings into a cloud of vapor that users inhale. Vape pens are larger, produce bigger clouds of vapor and look less like traditional cigarettes than other e-cigarettes.   In a lab experiment, researchers randomly assigned 108 young adult smokers to interact with a person using either traditional cigarettes or vape pens. Both scenarios led to a similar spike in participants’ desire to smoke a cigarette, even if they had never tried a vape pen before.    These results were a surprise, and cast doubt on the potential for e-cigarettes to work as smoking cessation aid, said lead study author Andrea King, a psychiatry researcher at the University of Chicago.   “Smokers needs to be aware that – just like Pavlov’s dogs salivating to a bell associated with food – cigarettes, ashtrays, lighters, etc. may increase desire to smoke and alert the brain’s reward system,” King said by email.   “Our findings would suggest that smokers may want to reduce their exposures to the use of e-cigarettes as well as traditional cigarettes,” King added.    Big U.S. tobacco companies are all developing e-cigarettes. In the decade since the devices came on the U.S. market, public health experts have debated whether they might help with smoking cessation or at least be a safer alternative to smoking traditional combustible cigarettes, or whether they might lure a new generation into nicotine addiction.   The current study doesn’t explore the safety of the devices, but it does cast doubt on the potential for e-cigarettes to help blunt cravings for cigarettes.   In their experiment, King and colleagues testing smoking urges in 108 men and women aged 18 to 35 who currently smoked an average of about nine cigarettes a day.    More than 80 percent of the participants had also tried e-cigarettes at least once and almost 30 percent had used one in the past month.    When people volunteered for the study, researchers told them they would be invited to participate in an experiment assessing their mood after completing certain tasks or social interactions. Participants didn’t know the experiment was really assessing their urge to smoke.    In the lab, participants chatted with researchers posing as other volunteers. During these interactions, the pretending volunteer either smoked a traditional tobacco cigarette or used a vape pen. Both cues increased desire among research subjects for a cigarette or an e-cigarette.    The level and duration of desire to smoke among volunteers was the same whether they observed the researcher smoking a cigarette or using a vape pen. When the researcher drank bottled water, however, volunteers had no change in desire to smoke or vape.   At the end of the experiment, researchers tested the ability to resist smoking in a subset of 26 volunteers who were daily smokers. Researchers put a cigarette, lighter and ashtray in front of the volunteers and told them they could smoke or receive 20 cents for every five minutes they resisted.    Most volunteers held out for only 20 minutes, and this delay was the same whether their partner had been previously using a vape pen or a cigarette, the study found.    One limitation of the study is that its small size and lab setting make it difficult to know how seeing vape pens would influence smoking urges among smokers in real life situations, the authors note in Nicotine and Tobacco Research.    Still, the findings suggest being around vapers may make it harder for smokers to quit, said Dr. Brian Primack, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It may lead to more urges to smoke or more relapses,” Primack said by email.

2iATBNW,2017-01-19,Barbecued and smoked meat tied to risk of death from breast cancer," (Reuters Health) - Women who eat a lot of grilled, smoked and barbecued meats and develop breast cancer may be more likely to die from their cancer than those who eat less of these foods, a U.S. study suggests.     A higher intake of barbecued, smoked or grilled meat before diagnosis was also associated with 23 percent higher odds of death from all causes, the study found.    Of the three cooking options, smoking may be the worst. Routinely eating smoked beef, lamb and pork was tied to a 17 percent greater risk of death from all causes and 23 percent higher odds of dying from breast cancer.    “There are many carcinogens found in grilled or smoked meats,” said lead study author Humberto Parada, a researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “One of the most common are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which are formed during combustion of organic material.”   Women may be exposed to these carcinogens by cigarette smoke or air pollution, which are associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, Parada said by email. Some research has suggested exposure to these chemicals through grilled or smoked meat can increase the risk of breast cancer, but the current study offers some of the first evidence suggesting it also influences survival odds.    “Grilling or smoking meats produces PAHs much more readily than other cooking methods, such as pan-frying,” Parada said. “Several factors may influence the formation of PAHs including ‘doneness’ and meat type - higher fat content may result in the formation of more PAHs.”   For the current study, researchers interviewed 1,508 women diagnosed with breast cancer about their eating habits in 1996 or 1997 and then questioned them again five years later.    After following half of the women for at least 17.6 years, there were 597 deaths including 237 fatalities from breast cancer.    Compared to women who consistently ate only small amounts of grilled, barbecued or smoked meat, women who consumed a lot of these foods both before and after their diagnosis were 31 percent more likely to die during the study period, researchers report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.    Women who included poultry and fish in their diet before or after their breast cancer diagnosis were 45 percent less likely to die during the study than women who didn’t eat these foods.   Lower levels of saturated fats in chicken and fish relative to red meats might help explain this, Dr. Pagona Lagiou, a researcher at the University of Athens Medical School in Greece who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   It’s also possible that chicken and fish have a protective effect because women eat less red meat, said Carrie Daniel-MacDougall, a researcher at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Simply increasing fish or poultry intake, without reducing red meat intake, is likely to be less beneficial for cancer prevention,” Daniel-MacDougall added by email.    One limitation of the study is that it relied on women to report how often they consumed different foods and didn’t assess portion sizes or the number of times they ate meats each week, the authors note. The study also isn’t an experiment, so it cannot prove that different types of meat influence survival odds with breast cancer.    Still, the findings suggest women should pay attention to how they cook their food to minimize their exposure to carcinogenic chemicals, said Dr. Mingyang Song, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and Harvard University who wasn’t involved in the study.    “These chemicals can be produced from wood smoke or when fat and juices from meat grilled directly over an open fire drip onto the fire, creating flames and smoke,” Song said by email. “Generally, the fattier the meat is, the higher the chemical levels will be.”    "
2jLy5Tz,2017-01-18,Paying people to walk more may work until the money runs out," (Reuters Health) - Handing out prize money for exercise might get people moving, but a new study suggests the increased activity only lasts as long as the cash keeps coming.    In an experiment, researchers gave 94 older adults daily walking goals and pedometers to track their progress. They randomly sorted participants into four groups to get different types of weekly motivation for meeting the walking goals: $20 to keep for themselves, $20 to donate to a charity of their choice, $20 to keep or donate or a control group that got no cash at all.    During the 16-week experiment, people who had the chance to get cash were more than three times as likely to meet daily walking goals as the group that had no way to win money, the study found.    Over another 16 weeks of follow-up after payments ended, however, there wasn’t a meaningful difference between the groups in how often people met their walking goals.    “I think that people don’t continue their changed behavior of walking more because they are not getting that immediate incentive or reinforcement from the money,” said senior study author Karen Glanz, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.    “We’ve seen that, in order to maintain behavior change, people have to ‘internalize’ the reward – that could be by focusing on how walking more makes them feel better, such as having more energy or easier everyday activities, or helps them get off medication,” Glanz added by email.    Adults should get at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity a week, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    All of the people in the study lived in retirement communities, and they were 80 years old on average.    At the start of the study, they walked an average of 4,556 steps a day. This amounts to a bit more than two miles at a comfortable pace for most people, and might take a total of 30 to 40 minutes to complete.    Every participant had the same daily goal – to walk 50 percent more than they did at the beginning of the experiment. This translated into a daily goal of about 6,379 steps on average, or more than three miles, extending walking time to about 45 to 60 minutes.    Both financial incentives and opportunity to donate to charity increased walking, by 2,348 steps and 2,562 steps per day, respectfully, researchers report in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.    There wasn’t a statistically meaningful difference in the number of days people met goals based on the type of financial incentive they could get.    After the payouts went away, all of the groups that had been offered money walked less, dropping down to about the same level seen in the control group that didn’t have a chance to win money.    The study was small, making it hard to spot statistically meaningful differences among the groups, the authors note. The experiment was also too short to see how payouts might influence long-term changes in physical activity levels.    Financial incentives may work well to trigger motivation and to increase walking during the time they are handed out, said Dr. Per Ladenvall, a researcher at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden who wasn’t involved in the study. Long-term behavior change, however, may require counseling or other efforts to motivate people to stick with their exercise programs, Ladenvall said by email.    “I think financial incentives can serve a purpose of helping people increase their physical activity over a short-term,” said Lucas Carr, a physiology researcher at the University of Iowa in Iowa City who wasn’t involved in the study.    “In terms of maintaining activity long-term, I think we need to focus on designing work, school and neighborhood environments that sustainably nudge everyone to be more active,” Carr added by email.

2iSgw5U,2017-01-19,"Blood pressure care in U.S. improving, but disparities remain"," (Reuters Health) - Treatment of high blood pressure is improving in the United States, but a new study suggests white people are seeing more improvements than black or Hispanic people.   Blacks and Hispanics were less likely to have their blood pressure under control, compared to whites, researchers found. Hispanics were also less likely than whites to be treated for the condition.   The new study shows public health efforts to improve blood pressure control are working, but “there are still disparities that still affect minorities,” said senior author Dr. Edgar Argulian, of Mt. Sinai St. Luke’s Hospital in New York City.   “It probably means we need to tweak those efforts,” he told Reuters Health.    The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends keeping systolic blood pressure (the top number of a reading) below 120 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). Diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) should be below 80 mmHg.   High blood pressure - known as hypertension - can lead to stroke, heart problems, kidney disease and other health issues, according to the AHA. Doctors usually start prescribing medicine to lower blood pressure when a person’s readings are consistently over 140/90 mmHG.   For the new study, the researchers analyzed data collected from 8,796 U.S. adults with high blood pressure between 2003 and 2012 as part of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.   Blood pressure treatment and control increased during that time period, the researchers write in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.    Treatment rates increased from about 66 percent in 2003-2004 to about 77 percent in 2010-2012. The proportion of people who got their blood pressure under control increased from 33 percent to 45 percent over the same period.   White people tended to do better on a variety of measures, however.   About 74 percent of whites, 71 percent of blacks and 61 percent of Hispanics were being treated for their high blood pressure over the course of the study, the researchers found.   All three groups experienced substantial improvement in hypertension control over the course of the study. But while roughly 43 percent of whites had their hypertension under control during the study period, only about 37 percent of blacks and about 31 percent of Hispanics could say the same.   Doctors are treating blacks nearly as often as whites for high blood pressure, the researchers note, but blacks are still less likely to have the condition under control.   Black people are particularly predisposed to high blood pressure and more aggressive forms of the condition, said Argulian.   Unlike blacks, Hispanics were not treated as aggressively as whites for high blood pressure. They were also less likely to have their condition under control.   “There is no biological evidence to suggest that Hispanics are more vulnerable to loss of blood pressure control,” lead author Dr. Anna Gu, of St. John’s University in New York, told Reuters Health.   For Hispanics, factors like access to health insurance and language barriers may be obstacles to getting appropriate care, Gu said.   “One of the things we should get out of this study is what a bad job we’re doing controlling blood pressure across the board,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, who directs the Cleveland Clinic’s Women’s Cardiovascular Center in Ohio.   Doctors can be better at providing the best proven treatments for individual patients, said Cho, who was not involved with the new study.    For example, she told Reuters Health, high blood pressure among black people responds well to drugs known as calcium channel blockers and diuretics.   People should be encouraged to monitor their blood pressure at home, she added.   Argulian said treating hypertension is a complex issue that goes beyond merely giving patients pills to take. Blood pressure control needs to take into account many lifestyle factors like weight and diet, but also social factors like insurance access and ability to get and take medications, he said.  "
2jRqpOY,2017-01-18,Person-to-person contact may cause most drug-resistant TB cases," (Reuters Health) - The worst form of drug-resistant tuberculosis isn’t just arising from inadequate treatment, it’s mostly being spread from person to person, according to a new study of hundreds of cases in South Africa that has important implications for how the deadly disease is treated.   Researchers tracked TB that is resistant to at least four key drugs and found that 69 percent of the victims had never received treatment, an indication that they had acquired it from others with extensively drug-resistant TB.   TB develops resistance to drugs when it is attacked with lackluster therapy, allowing the slow-growing bacterium to become insensitive to well-established therapies. Strains that are simultaneously resistant to at least four drugs have been reported in 105 countries.   “For many years, there was this thought that maybe drug-resistant TB strains might not be able to be transmitted as efficiently a regular TB strains,” coauthor Dr. Neel R. Gandhi of Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta told Reuters Health by phone.   The results published in the New England Journal of Medicine “turn this idea on its head,” said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious disease at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Atlanta who was not involved in the research.   The study team’s estimate that two thirds of the cases are surfacing because the disease is spreading by person-to-person contact “is mostly likely a minimum estimate,” Gandhi said.   “This is an epidemic we’ve known about for 10 years and we don’t seem to be making a dent in it,” he said. “And that may be because the driver isn’t what we thought it was.”   “It raises the possibility of turning the clock back to the 1930s and 1940s” and requiring infected people to live in sanitariums so patients can’t inadvertently spread the disease, Schaffner said. “You also have to do better at diagnosing them earlier. We’re going to have to be a lot more aggressive in finding the infected people early. These are substantial public health challenges.”   Drug resistance has gotten so bad, the rate of successful treatment can be less than 40 percent if a person acquires an extensively drug-resistant strain. It can be particularly deadly in people who also harbor HIV, the AIDS virus. In South Africa, where the new study was done, there has been a 10-fold increase in the number of extensively drug-resistant cases in the past decade. One in 36,000 are now infected.   The team of researchers used contact tracing to find where the TB patients were spending at least two hours per week, trying to uncover any links.   They found 31 clusters of the disease, the largest of which accounted for 84 percent of the 404 patients they studied.   Living with someone with TB accounted for most of the acquired cases, although the disease was also spread in the workplace (representing 13 percent of cases) or in other community settings such as a church, bar, beauty salon or prison (accounting for 8 percent of cases).   “Certain networks spanned multiple homes, family generations, and community settings,” the study team writes.   Complicating control is that people can be infectious before they know they have drug-resistant TB.   “We know people transmit (the disease) for weeks or months before they come for a diagnosis,” said Gandhi, an associate professor of epidemiology, global health and infectious diseases at Emory.   “You have to focus on stopping the chain of transmission,” he said. “You have to identify early and intervene early. When you diagnose, drug susceptibility should be part of that diagnosis. And we have to do a better job creating facilities where transmission doesn’t take place, particularly in healthcare settings, hospitals, homeless shelters in the United States and in schools and workplaces.”   The other researchers involved in the study were from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa, the province of 10.3 million people where the study was done.

2jy5dAO,2017-01-18,Successful pregnancy possible even with heart defects," (Reuters Health) - Women who are born with high-risk heart defects can have successful pregnancies if they get the right medical support, according to new U.S. guidelines.                     A child touches her pregnant mother's stomach at the last stages of her pregnancy in Bordeaux April 28, 2010. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau       The guidelines are the first from the American Heart Association to offer a road map to women with congenital heart defects who have long been told to avoid pregnancy altogether, said Mary Canobbio, a researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles and chair of the committee that drafted the advice.    “Historically the tendency has been to advise these women to avoid pregnancy because the defect and surgeries done to keep these women alive are complex and the long term survival is difficult to predict – so concern has been that the ‘added burden’ of pregnancy could potentially cause more problems and decrease their own long term survival,” Canobbio said by email.    Congenital heart defects such as defective vessels, leaky valves or holes in the heart muscle are among the most common types of birth defects. These structural problems can cause symptoms like abnormal heart rhythm and breathing difficulties and may require surgery or a heart transplant.   While most girls born today with congenital heart disease will reach childbearing age, pregnancy carries a risk of complications for both these mothers and their babies.    One concern is that women’s blood volume increases by 50 percent during pregnancy to help support her growing baby. That means the mother’s heart must be able to handle the additional burden, Canobbio said.    Hormonal changes during pregnancy can also increase the risk of irregular heart rhythm and blood clotting. In healthy women these changes aren’t usually a problem, but in women with structural heart damage this can increase their risk of stroke, Canobbio added.   Pre-pregnancy counseling is essential for women with complex congenital heart defects so that they have a clear understanding of how their heart abnormalities could affect both their own health and the health of their child during a pregnancy, the new guidelines advise.    For some structural heart problems, and women with a family history of these problems dating back several generations, genetic screening before conception can help estimate the odds that women may pass heart defects on to their children.   Once pregnant, a delivery plan is also essential, so the medical team can anticipate problems that could happen during and following delivery and be prepared.    Ideally, women should deliver their babies at medical centers that have a cardiologist experienced in managing complex congenital heart disease, obstetricians trained in high-risk maternal-fetal medicine, cardiac anesthesia and a cardiac surgical team.   After delivery, women need monitoring for up to six months because the effects of pregnancy can linger that long, the guidelines also note.    The scientific statement, published in Circulation, will likely set a new standard of prenatal, delivery and postpartum care for women with congenital heart defects because this marks the first time a leading U.S. cardiology group has weighed in, said Dr. Wayne Franklin, medical director of the adult congenital heart disease program at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston.   “The take-home message here is that women should talk to their cardiologist, and also obtain preconception counseling with a maternal-fetal-medicine specialist, if they have a heart problem but are considering pregnancy,” Franklin, a researcher in obstetrics and cardiology who wasn’t involved in the guidelines, said by email.    That’s because normal changes in blood volume, heart rate and blood pressure that happen in every pregnancy can adversely affect women with congenital heart disease, Franklin said.    And, mothers with congenital heart disease have an 8- to 10-fold increase in the chance of their baby having a congenital heart defect, Franklin added. With close monitoring, many problems in developing infants can be detected before infants are born.   “We now know that with close collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team, we can achieve excellent outcomes for both the mother and baby,” Franklin said.

2jtWBaQ,2017-01-18,Migraines tied to increased stroke risk after surgery," (Reuters Health) - People with a history of migraines may be more likely to have a stroke after surgery than patients who don’t get these severe headaches, a recent study suggests.    While stroke was rare in the study, the odds of stroke within 30 days of surgery were 75 percent higher for people with a history of migraines.    When patients had a history of migraines with aura – or visual symptoms such as flashing or shimmering lights, zigzagging lines or stars – the odds of stroke were more than doubled.   “Our study shows that patients with migraine, particularly migraine with aura, undergoing a surgical procedure are at increased risk of perioperative ischemic stroke and readmission to hospital within 30 days after discharge,” said senior study author Dr. Matthias Eikermann of Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.    Ischemic stroke, the most common type, results from an obstruction in a blood vessel supplying the brain. Many previous studies have linked migraine to an increased risk of stroke.    Up to one in five people get migraines, a chronic, often debilitating disorder characterized by severe headaches as well as symptoms like nausea and intense sensitivity to sight or sound, researchers note in The BMJ.    To assess how migraine history influenced the odds of stroke following surgery, researchers examined data on 124,588 patients who had operations requiring general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation from 2007 to 2014.    People with a history of migraines made up about 8 percent of the total cases. Of these 8,901 patients diagnosed with migraine, 1,278 had migraine with aura.   Overall, 771 people had a stroke within 30 days of surgery, or less than 1 percent of the study population. Most often, strokes occurred after vascular, heart or brain surgery.    Among all the patients who had a stroke, 89 of them, or about 12 percent, had a history of migraine with or without aura.    The absolute risk of stroke was about 2.4 cases for every 1,000 surgical patients, researchers estimated. For patients with a history of migraine, the risk increased to about 4.3 strokes for every 1,000 surgical patients.    In addition, researchers examined how often surgical patients were admitted to the hospital within 30 days of being sent home.   Altogether, 10,088 people had repeat hospital admissions.    Compared to patients without any history of migraines, the risk of repeat admissions was 59 percent higher for people with a history of migraine with aura and 27 percent greater for migraine without aura.    Researchers speculate that genetics may play a role, as well as characteristics of the brains of people with migraines that make them more susceptible to stroke.    “Patients with migraine have a hyperexcitable brain, which increases the vulnerability to stroke during and after surgery,” Eikermann said by email.    “When examining the electrical activity of the brain of patients with migraine, we observe a spreading depolarization which induces prolonged constriction of the blood vessels in the brain leading to decreased oxygen supply during migraine aura and stroke,” Eikermann added.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment and it can’t prove that migraines cause increased stroke risk.    Another limitation of the study is that it relied on billing codes to identify people with migraines and lacked clinical information that might offer other explanations for an increased risk of stroke in some patients, the authors note.    Even so, the findings should prompt doctors to consider migraine history when they assess the risks of surgery and when they monitor patients for complications afterwards, said Dr. Samuel Wann, a researcher at Ascension Wisconsin Cardiovascular Physicians in Milwaukee who wasn’t involved in the study.    “This important study reminds us that migraine headaches, especially those associated with an aura, are not benign and can be associated with stroke,” Wann said by email.

2jCul6V,2017-01-16,U.S. high school soccer concussions on the rise," (Reuters Health) - As soccer has soared in popularity in recent decades, concussion rates for youth players have also surged, a U.S. study suggests.   Researchers examined data on high school soccer players from 2005 to 2014 and found non-concussion injury rates declined for boys and were little changed for girls. But concussions increased in both male and female players.    The significant rise in concussion rates “could be mainly due to a better recognition of concussion by medical and coaching staff,” study leader Dr. Morteza Khodaee, a sports medicine researcher at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said in an email.    The research team looked at injuries per minute of athletic exposure (AE), which includes both practices and competitions, for U.S. high school athletes.    Overall, there were 6,154 injuries during 2.98 million athletic exposures, for an injury rate of 2.06 per 1,000 AEs, the study found.    That included about 1.8 million soccer injuries among girls and 1.5 million among boys.    Girls were 27 percent more likely to sustain soccer injuries than boys, the study found.    Injuries were 42 percent more common in competitions than during practice.    “The majority of injuries during competitions occurred during the second half indicating a potential accumulated effect of fatigue,” the authors reported.   “It is well known that the risk of injury is higher in competition compared with practice,” Khodaee said. “This is most likely due to more intense, full contact and potentially riskier play that occurs in competition.”   Still, while injury rates were significantly higher in competition, more than one third of all injuries occurred in practice.    About 43 percent of injuries overall happened when athletes collided with another player.    Midfielders sustained the most injuries, accounting for 38 percent of cases for boys and 37 percent among girls.    The most common diagnoses were ligament sprains, accounting for about 30 percent of injuries.   Concussions accounted for about 18 percent of injuries, followed by muscle strains at 16 percent.    Injuries that forced players to stop participating most often involved ligament sprains and fractures, but concussions made up almost 11 percent of these cases.   Overall, the concussion rate during the study period was about 0.36 per 1,000 AEs. Among girls, it rose from about 0.4 per 1,000 AEs at the start of the study to about 0.6 per 1,000 AEs at the end. For boys, the rate rose from about 0.2 to 0.45 per 1,000 AEs over the course of the study.    Concussions accounted for about 17 percent of injuries among boys and 19 percent of injuries among girls.    In about 21 percent of concussion cases, symptoms resolved within one day. But recovery took more than one week in 29 percent of concussions.    Most concussions required athletes to miss between one and three weeks of soccer. Athletes were medically disqualified for an entire season in 3.5 percent of concussion cases, the study found.    One limitation of the study is that not all schools in the U.S. contributed data for analysis, the authors note. Only injuries reported to an athletic trainer were included.    Researchers also lacked data on how many minutes individual players participated in sport, requiring them to instead calculate injury rates based on the total minutes of play for teams. This means injury rates in the study don’t necessary reflect how much time athletes spend on the field.    “This was only an epidemiologic study to calculate the risk of injuries and (find) any differences in sex, position of players, and mechanism of injuries,” Khodaee said.   "
2iE7yco,2017-01-16,Friends may influence children&#039;s fear and anxiety," (Reuters Health) - Parents may have a lot to do with how children react to scary things, but a new study suggests kids’ response to fear may also be heavily influenced by their friends.   In an experiment, researchers gave kids 7 to 10 years old information about scary-looking animals. They assessed how children felt on their own, and again after kids discussed their perceptions with friends.    After speaking to friends, children tended to shift their opinions to match how their friends felt about the animals, the study found.    “Studies show that children tend to choose friends who have similar attributes to themselves and that they can also become more similar through their interactions,” said lead study author Jinnie Ooi, a psychology researcher at the University of East Anglia in the UK.   “In our study, there was some evidence that the friends had similar levels of anxiety symptoms and fear responses even before they had their discussion, and that they became more similar in their fears after the discussion” Ooi added by email.    Anxiety disorders are one of the most common mental illnesses, affecting almost one in five adults at some point, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Symptoms often emerge in childhood.    For the current study, 106 boys and 136 girls completed age-appropriate questionnaires to measure anxiety and beliefs about fear.    Then, participants were show pictures of two animals that would be unfamiliar to them – the cuscus and the quoll – Australian marsupials. Researchers read two versions of information about the animals – one that was neutral and one that described the creatures as dangerous.    Researchers assessed how kids felt about each animal on their own, then asked kids to discuss the creatures with close friends.    To see how kids felt after these discussions, researchers gave them maps showing animals on a path and asked kids to mark the spot they would like to be in the image. Kids who put themselves far away from the animals show they’re trying to avoid the creatures, an indication of fear.    After speaking to friends, children tended to have fear responses similar to their friends, researchers report in Behaviour Research and Therapy.     There were some gender differences, however.    When pairs of boys discussed the animals, they tended to show a significant increase in fear after they talked.    Pairs of girls, however, showed a significant decrease in their fear beliefs when they had seen threatening information.    Children’s fear-related thoughts didn’t necessarily become more negative when they discuss their fears with close friends who are more anxious.    The study is small and doesn’t prove how much peers influence fear relative to other factors such as family or genetics.    But the results suggest that anxious children who become friends with kids who are also anxious may contribute to each other’s fearfulness. Therapy might help reduce anxiety in these children by helping pairs of friends learn to discuss and resolve their fears in a more positive manner that helps to diffuse anxiety, the authors say.    “Childhood anxiety disorders are the most common psychological disorders in preadolescent children,” Ooi said. “This work has the potential to contribute to the prevention of problems with anxiety, for example through work in schools, and also to inform treatment interventions in a clinical setting for childhood anxiety disorders.”  "
2jfkeY9,2017-01-16,Construction workers still at high risk for strains and sprains," (Reuters Health) - Despite significant improvements in the last 25 years, U.S. construction workers are still at high risk for on-the-job injuries to muscles, tendons, joints and nerves, a new study reports.   These work-related injuries often occur because of overwork, excessive exposure to vibration, bending, twisting and adopting awkward body postures. Collectively known as work-related musculoskeletal disorders, or WMSDs, they can be costly. The estimated wage loss for private wage-and-salary construction workers in 2014 was US$46 million, the study authors say.   “The average risk of WMSDs in construction is continually higher than all industries combined,” study leader Xiuwen Sue Dong told Reuters Health by email.   “Our study found that the major event and exposure of WMSDs among construction workers was overexertion, and (the) back was the primary body part affected by WMSDs, accounting for more than 40 percent of the WMSDs,” Dong said.   “Ergonomic solutions should be adopted extensively at construction sites in order to reduce WMSDs,” said Dong, a researcher with The Center for Construction Research and Training in Silver Spring, Maryland.   As reported in Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Dong and her colleagues examined data from 1992–2014 Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses, the 1992-2014 Current Population Survey, and the 1997 -2014 Occupational Employment Statistics.    The number of construction-related WMSDs dropped from almost 55,000 in 1992 to just over 18,000 in 2014.   However, all other types of construction injuries decreased as well, and WMSDs accounted for about one of every four non-fatal construction injuries throughout the study period.   “In my opinion, the significant drop in the number and rate of reported WMSDs may be due to continuous intervention efforts in construction, the changes of OSHA recordkeeping requirements, and potential injury and illness underreporting in this industry,” Dong said.   Age and time on the job were risk factors, the study found. The overall proportion of WMSD cases reported for construction workers ages 55 to 64 years rose from 6.4 percent in 1992 to 11.5 percent in 2014, and injuries were more common in workers who had been on the job for more than five years.    Furthermore, time away from work due to WMSDs increased from an average of 8 days in 1992 to an average of 13 days in 2014.    “I believe this reflects the aging workforce in the construction industry, and longer recovery times among older workers experiencing WMSDs,” Dong said.   Construction laborers had the most WMSDs, but rates of injury were higher among construction helpers, heating and air-conditioning mechanics, cement masons and sheet metal workers, she noted.   There are a number of reasons why days away from work could increase, said Dr. June Spector, an occupational health researcher at the University of Washington School of Public Health in Seattle.   Spector, who was not involved with the study, pointed out in a phone interview that if a healthcare provider releases a worker to a limited duty job, but there isn’t one available, that might delay the return to work.    “More severe injuries might also have longer recovery times,” she added. “I would say it’s a little bit hard to figure out for sure what’s happening but I think the authors’ speculation about longer recovery times among older workers with work-related musculoskeletal disorders is a possibility.”   Spector suggested ways to reduce the risk of injury.   “If a hazard can be removed totally, that’s ideal, but that’s often not practical. The next level that we often will look at is engineering controls,” Spector said, adding that powered equipment can be used to help move heavy materials.   “We can also think about adjustments to work organization, for example ensuring that someone isn’t alone when they have to lift a heavy load or asked to do the same thing for a long time repeatedly, that there are others around that can help,” she said.   Spector agreed that optimal ergonomics is also important, “for example, training and becoming proficient in the safest ways to lift heavy objects.”  "
2ioptjM,2017-01-13,Cognitive therapy improves behavior issues in kids with night terrors," (Reuters Health) - Young children who receive cognitive behavior therapy to help them cope with night terrors may have fewer behavior problems tied to poor sleep than kids who receive therapy that doesn’t include advice on how to manage symptoms, a recent study suggests.    The study focused on 90 children, ages 4 to 6, with severe and persistent fears that interfere with normal functioning and cause considerable stress for kids and their families.    These night terrors affect about 10 percent of children, and are much more debilitating than the occasional nightmares that wake kids every so often.    Researchers randomly assigned the children into two groups. One group received cognitive behavior therapy involving structured play with their parents designed to build coping skills. The other group received non-directive therapy involving playtime with parents but no guidance on how to manage the sleep issues.   Four weeks after treatment, all of the children had significantly fewer nighttime fears and sleep disruptions. With cognitive therapy, however, parents reported more improvements in sleep and behavior.    This suggests that cognitive behavior therapy, an established treatment for older kids with sleep problems, may also work with young children when a play component is added, said lead study author Michael Kahn of Tel Aviv University in Israel.   “The take-home message for parents is that sleep problems in the preschool age can be successfully treated with very brief interventions,” Kahn said by email.    “Parents could try addressing the problem on their own by being aware of their own cognitions and knowledge regarding sleep (for example, understanding the importance of regular bedtime routines), by speaking to their child about it and trying to find creative solutions that would help him or her to spend the night in their own bed (e.g., using a stuffed animal, a flashlight, placing a picture of the family near the child’s bed, etc.), and by limiting the extent of their accommodation to the child’s attempts to avoid falling and staying asleep in his own bed,” Kahn added.    For kids receiving cognitive behavior therapy in the study, researchers encouraged parents and kids to role play with dolls in a doll house bedroom to practice bedtime routines. Children would act out going to sleep and parents would gradually play smaller and smaller parts at bedtime and during the night to model the independent sleep habits they wanted kids to develop.    During these games, kids could earn rewards like stickers after successfully completing sleep exercises.    Children assigned to the control group didn’t get guidance on how to practice a good bedtime routine or cope with nighttime awakenings during the playtime with parents.    Researchers measured sleep using devices that track sleep, called actigraphs, and by asking parents how well children slept.    The actigraph measurements didn’t show more sleep improvement with cognitive behavior therapy, but parents in this group reported greater reductions in kids’ sleep problems and co-sleeping, researchers report in Sleep Medicine.    The researchers admit that because they used a variety of different therapy approaches, it’s difficult to pinpoint how each treatment component may have influenced how well kids managed to sleep through the night in their own beds.    The study may also have been too small to determine statistically meaningful differences in some of the interventions tested.    Even so, the findings add to a large body of evidence suggesting behavior therapy helps reduce bedtime problems and nighttime awakenings, said Jocelyn Thomas, a psychology researcher at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study.    “This treatment is based on the theory of learned behavior and involves teaching the parent to manage the child’s behavior,” Thomas said by email.

2jfobMC,2017-01-13,Psoriasis with arthritis linked to heart disease risk," (Reuters Health) - Arthritis that accompanies the skin condition psoriasis may also come with a higher risk of heart problems, according to a Hong Kong study.   In particular, patients with so-called psoriatic arthritis may have a three- to four-fold higher prevalence of plaque in their coronary arteries, which leads to a higher heart attack risk.   Clinicians need to identify patients with high cardiovascular (CV) risk so they can provide lifestyle advice and preventive treatment to those individuals, said study author Lai-Shan Tam of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.    Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are related, but not everyone who has the red, scaly skin patches associated with psoriasis will develop the more severe psoriatic arthritis associated with joint swelling and pain.    According to the National Psoriasis Foundation, about 30 percent of those with psoriasis develop the inflammatory arthritis, which that can cause permanent damage to joints.   Compared to the general population, people with psoriatic arthritis had a 68 percent higher risk of heart attack and a 43 percent higher risk of death during previous studies, the authors of the new study point out in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases. Although the increased risk and association are known, studies can’t yet explain why.    Atherosclerosis, or hardening and narrowing of the arteries, is one risk factor that reliably predicts heart problems. Recent studies of atherosclerosis in patients with psoriatic arthritis have been limited to ultrasound images of the carotid arteries in the neck, however, so Tam and colleagues decided to use CT scans to look at multiple arteries around the heart.   The research team evaluated 90 psoriatic arthritis patients and 205 patients who didn’t have this condition but who did have cardiovascular risk factors, such as chest pain.   The psoriatic arthritis patients, who didn’t have a prior heart disease diagnosis, had significantly higher amounts of plaques of all kinds, including non-calcified and mixed plaques that are considered more likely to rupture and cause heart attacks.   Sixty percent of psoriatic arthritis patients had at least one coronary plaque, as compared with 35 percent of the other patients. In addition, the researchers found three-vessel disease in 13 percent of psoriatic arthritis patients, compared to 3 percent of controls, and they found that blood vessels had narrowed by more than 50 percent in 9 percent of patients with psoriatic arthritis, versus 3 percent of controls.    Men over age 55 with longer histories of psoriatic arthritis were more likely to have the plaques most commonly associated with heart problems.   If doctors know to look for signs of heart disease sooner, they may be able to prescribe statins, anti-hypertension drugs and anti-inflammatory drugs before needing more aggressive treatment such as percutaneous coronary intervention or an angioplasty to improve blood flow to the heart, Tam told Reuters Health by email.    This could also be true for patients with other chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, Tam and colleagues reported in another study. The researchers would also like to study atherosclerosis in patients with the milder psoriasis.   “A large proportion of patients could be having silent coronary artery disease,” Tam said.   The study focuses on one group of patients at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Hong Kong, and the results might not be applicable everywhere, said Lihi Eder of the University of Toronto, who wasn’t involved with the study. The researchers also couldn’t study the effect of medications or changes for individual patients.   “The effect of psoriatic disease varies significantly over time,” she told Reuters Health. But additional studies “investigating atherosclerosis . . . could assist in understanding a link.”  "
2iMIUEb,2017-01-12,Hormone specialists want more education about transgender patients," (Reuters Health) - Doctors who specialize in conditions involving hormones need more training on how to treat people who are transgender, suggests a new study.   Researchers found that transgender health was part of the curriculum at less than three quarters of endocrinology training programs that responded to an online survey.    Additionally, more than 80 percent of practicing specialists said they had never received training on transgender medicine.       “We were aware that a deficit in education likely existed, however it was surprising how big this deficit is amongst clinicians in practice,” wrote lead author Dr. Caroline Davidge-Pitts, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.   Gender identity is how people view themselves, that is, as male, female or something less specific. People who are transgender have gender identities that differ from the sex assigned at birth.   While awareness and acceptance of transgender issues has increased in the past decade, providing optimal care for patients is still challenging, the researchers write in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.   Endocrinologists often have a key role in that care. They specialize in the endocrine system, which regulates the body’s hormones, and they may prescribe sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen to help transgender patients develop the physical characteristics tied to their gender identity.   Information is lacking on how much doctors in endocrinology training programs are taught about transgender care. There is also not much information on the training of doctors who are already in practice.   For the new study, the researchers sent a web-based survey to directors of 104 endocrinology training programs and received answers back from 54. About 94 percent said teaching about transgender care is important, but only about 72 percent included the topic in their curricula.   All programs covered the principles of hormone therapy for transgender patients, but only about 63 percent taught trainees to take comprehensive social and sexual histories on those patients. Also, only 40 percent taught trainees how to conduct physical exams on transgender patients.   “Endocrinology fellowships continue to face challenges adding transgender health topics to the curriculum and we need to be proactive about finding ways to improve this,” Davidge-Pitts told Reuters Health.   The research team also sent surveys to nearly 7,000 medical doctors who were members of the Endocrine Society, but only a very small percentage - 411 doctors - responded. About 80 percent said they had treated transgender patients at some point during their career, but a similar proportion said they were never trained in the specifics of that specialized care.   Most of the doctors reported confidence in using proper terminology, taking histories and providing hormones, but few showed similar confidence discussing psychosocial and legal issues, surgical interventions and screening guidelines.   “In my view, the notable thing is that they’re saying ‘train me more,’” said Dr. Joshua Safer, medical director for Transgender Medicine and Surgery at the Boston University School of Medicine.   The researchers found that directors of training programs desire online programs for trainees and teachers, lectures and would like to attend meetings that discuss transgender topics. Similarly, practicing endocrinologists who responded to the survey wanted online training and presentations about transgender topics at academic meetings.   Safer, who was not involved with the new research, is working to update the Endocrine Society’s 2009 guidelines on transgender care.   “The real take-home message is the clinical population still feels unprepared,” he told Reuters Health.   The new guidelines should go a long was to closing that gap, he added.  "
2j5mxKQ,2017-01-12,Can wearable sensors tell when you&#039;re sick?," (Reuters Health) – It may one day be possible to spot illness the same way many of us already track our exercise habits and sleep patterns: with wearable sensors, researchers say.    In a new study, 60 people wore devices that collected more than 250,000 measurements a day on things like heart rate, oxygen in the blood, activity levels, calories expended, sleep patterns and skin temperature.    After researchers got a baseline idea of normal readings for each person in the study, they looked for deviations from these typical patterns to see whether changes might be tied to new environmental conditions, illness, or other factors that can impact health.    The goal is a health dashboard that does for people what dashboards already do for cars, said senior study author Dr. Michael Snyder, director of the Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine at Stanford University in California.    “Your car has 400 sensors, and dashboard lights go on when a problem occurs like the engine starts overheating or you are nearly running out of gas,” Snyder said by email.    “In the future, you will have multiple sensors relaying information to your smartphone, which will become your health dashboard,” Snyder added. “Alerts will go off with elevated heart rate over your normal level and heart beat abnormalities will be detected - these will enable early detection of disease, perhaps even before you can detect it yourself.”    Altogether, Snyder and colleagues collected almost 2 billion measurements from the study participants, who each wore between one and seven commercially available activity monitors around the clock.    Snyder was one of the participants.   On a long flight for a family vacation last year, he noticed changes in his heart rate and oxygen levels. From previous trips with sensors, he knew his oxygen levels normally dropped during flights and his heart rate increased at the start of the flight but then returned to normal.    On this particular flight, however, his numbers didn’t return to normal, and Snyder then went on to develop a fever and other signs of illness.    He had a hunch that it might be Lyme disease because he’d spent time outdoors in rural Massachusetts two weeks earlier and might have been bitten by a tick that transmitted the illness. He convinced a doctor to prescribe an antibiotic, then got tests results that confirmed a Lyme diagnosis.    For a few other participants, higher than normal readings for heart rate and skin temperature also turned out to signal a developing illness.   A few successful predictions don’t mean the idea is ready for prime time, however. More research is needed before the snapshots of illness detection in the study might translate into gadgets people can purchase and use on their own. One device tested was recalled, and another didn’t appear to work well, the authors note.   Just because people can monitor some vital signs right now on their smartphone or fitness tracker doesn’t mean they can diagnose themselves without help from a doctor, noted Satchidananda Panda of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California.   “Many health enthusiasts will like this idea and will use the gadgets judiciously,” Panda, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email. “However, the danger lies in the vast majority of lay users who misinterpret the data.”   Because most patients only get vital signs checked at a physical or an appointment when they’re sick or something goes wrong, though, wearable sensors might help doctors do a better job of detecting the onset of disease and monitoring its progression, said Dr. Karandeep Singh, a medical researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Physiological changes precede the development of symptoms for a variety of illnesses, and being able to detect these changes early may bring patients to attention much earlier when diseases are more readily treatable and potentially curable,” Singh said by email.

2ja2HAM,2017-01-12,A scientist shares his lonely battle to withdraw from painkillers," (Reuters Health) - Travis Rieder spent more than four weeks in hospitals and nearly lost his foot after a van ran a stop sign and struck his motorcycle on Memorial Day weekend in 2015.   Rieder, 35, a research scientist at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics in Baltimore, considers himself handicapped now. He can no longer ride his bike, run or race, and sometimes he limps.   Still, the toughest challenge wasn’t the accident, five surgeries or having to walk with a cane, Rieder writes in a personal essay in Health Affairs.   His biggest trial came three months after the crash, when he returned home and one of his doctors advised him to get off the high doses of opioids prescribed to relieve his pain.   “I thought withdrawal might kill me,” Rieder writes. “The nausea left me curled up on the floor of the bathroom in the middle of the night.”    “I went three days without real sleep and – for the very first time in my life – had suicidal thoughts,” the essay says.   Rieder, a bioethicist, told Reuters Health in a phone interview that he wants to start a conversation about how the dozen doctors treating him were unable to provide him with information about how to stop taking the addictive medications.   The fact that no one on his medical team could help him was particularly stunning and infuriating given the national spotlight on the opioid epidemic, a crisis that has touched people in every state and in every demographic category in the U.S., Rieder said.    Opioid drug overdoses killed more than 33,000 Americans in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   Since 2009, more Americans have died every year from prescription opioid overdoses than from car crashes.    Rieder’s physicians knew how to control his pain with opioids. But they had no realistic plan for how he could quit taking them.    In fact, three weeks into an agonizing tapering scheme, when his wife called his prescribing doctor, a plastic surgeon, to say that her husband needed relief from crushing depression and the physical stress of withdrawal, the doctor suggested that Rieder might want to go back on the drugs.   “When people become addicted to painkillers after suffering a trauma, the best advice they might get from physicians when coping with withdrawal is to go back on it to feel better,” he writes. “Can we really do no better than that?”    “This is just insanely common,” Rieder told Reuters Health. “Doctors don’t know how to get patients off the medication. They have no education. This isn’t taught anywhere in most medical schools.”   Canadian-trained veterinarians generally receive more education on pain management and medicine than American-trained physicians, Rieder reports.    “This happened to me,” he said. “I’m a well-educated white dude who’s a professor at one of the best medical research institutions in the country. Is it any surprise that we’ve got this heroin epidemic? About 80 percent of heroin users say they got their start on prescription opioids,” he said.   “It never even occurred to me that I should be aggressively looking for the first possible moment that I could begin decreasing my medication, and no one told me to do so,” he writes in his essay.   People who become addicted to prescription painkillers and can no longer get their fix from physician-prescribed drugs sometimes turn to illegal drugs, often heroin.   “If someone like me has this hard a time getting off the medication, are you really so shocked that a bunch of people never really get off it?” Rieder asked.   Dr. Karl Wittnebel is not shocked. He directs a preoperative pain program for spinal-surgery patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The program was launched two years ago to try to reduce patients’ painkiller dosages before they undergo surgery.   Doctors often continue prescribing opioids past the time they are medically indicated and often fail to advise patients about how to wean off them, Wittnebel said in a phone interview.    The medications work best for acute, short-term pain, rather than long-term, chronic pain, he said.   “There’s a large number of people on high doses of medically prescribed opioids who lack access to medical practitioners willing to help them get off these drugs in an appropriate manner,” said Wittnebel, who was not involved with Rieder’s care.   Part of the problem, Wittnebel and Rieder said, is that doctors are paid poorly, if at all, for the complicated task of helping patients withdraw from opioids.   “Now that we understand the debilitating nature of opioid medications,” Wittnebel said, “we need to work to make opioid-reduction programs more accessible.”  "
2j1dieP,2017-01-11,Secondhand smoke during childhood may boost miscarriage risk," (Reuters Health) - Nonsmoking women who were exposed to secondhand smoke as children may have an increased risk of a miscarriage, a Chinese study suggests.                    A woman lights a cigarette in this illustration picture taken in Paris, October 8, 2014. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann      Although they had never been smokers themselves, women in the study who lived with two or more smokers as a child had a 20 percent higher risk of miscarriage, and those who were exposed to smoke five or more times per week had a 14 percent greater risk of losing a pregnancy, compared to women not exposed to secondhand smoke in childhood.    Nonsmokers who grew up with one smoker in the house, or were around smoke less than five times per week, didn’t appear to have any change in their miscarriage risk.   “Our findings support the enactment of stringent national smoke-free laws and strict enforcement in China, and promotion of smoke-free homes to protect children, as well as the need for campaigns to change social norms of smoking and passive smoking,” the authors wrote in Tobacco Control.   Shanshan Yang, a researcher at the Institute of Geriatrics at the Chinese PLA General Hospital in Beijing, and colleagues analyzed survey data for almost 20,000 women age 50 and older who live in Guangzhou, China.    About 57 percent of the women had been exposed to secondhand smoke during childhood, that is, before age 18.    The study had some limitations because the participants had to rely on memories of childhood, and the researchers were not able to assess how old the women were when they had their miscarriages or if they were exposed to secondhand smoke during their pregnancies.    Lucy Popova, a researcher with the Georgia State University School of Public Health in Atlanta, said there are considerable differences in smoking habits between the U.S. and China.    “In the U.S., smoking rates between men and women are pretty close; in China, very few women smoke while a majority of men smoke. There are also other factors (indoor smoking policies and rules, social norms) that might affect the rates of exposure to secondhand smoke in childhood,” she said.   However, Popover said the potential biological mechanisms linking secondhand smoke exposure and pregnancy loss would be the same no matter where the mother lives.    “So while a study might find different numbers of women with heavy childhood exposure to secondhand smoke, the relationship between exposure and pregnancy loss most likely will still be there,” she said.   She pointed out that three other studies, conducted in the U.S. and cited in the new report, have also shown that childhood secondhand smoke exposure is linked with pregnancy loss.   Popova added that according to the U.S. Surgeon General, there are no safe levels of exposure to secondhand smoke, even brief exposure causes immediate harm, and the only way to protect nonsmokers from the dangerous chemicals in secondhand smoke is to eliminate smoking indoors.    The authors of the report didn’t respond to a request for comment.  "
2j6TCbx,2017-01-11,Active kids less likely to be depressed later on," (Reuters Health) - Children who get more exercise may have fewer symptoms of depression than their peers who are less active, a recent study suggests.                     A boy jumps to save a goal while playing soccer on the beach in Benghazi June 1, 2014. REUTERS/Esam Omran Al-Fetori      Researchers used activity trackers to see how much physical activity children got, then interviewed kids and their parents to assess whether kids had symptoms of depression.    When kids got more moderate to vigorous physical activity at ages 6 and 8, they were less likely to have symptoms of major depressive disorder two years later, the study found.    “Our results indicate that increasing physical activity in children may prevent depression,” said study leader Dr. Tonje Zahl, of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim.   While plenty of research has documented the potential for exercise to boost mood and help with depression for adults, less is known about the ways activity may influence mental health in young children. Often, depression and other mental health disorders don’t emerge until adolescence or early adulthood.   The study included a sample of children from Trondheim. Researchers surveyed parents to assess children’s mental health at age 6, then did follow-up interviews with parents and kids at age 8 and 10 to determine whether they had symptoms of depression.    Altogether, they had data on 795 kids at age 6, 699 at age 8 and 702 at age 10.    At ages 6 and 8, children were asked to wear accelerometers to track their movements for one week, removing the devices only to bathe. The accelerometers showed that at age 6, kids typically got about 1.19 hours a day of moderate to vigorous physical activity and had 8.58 hours of sedentary time.    At age 8, active time was 1.18 hours a day on average with 9.22 hours of sedentary time.    By age 10, active time dipped to 1.09 hours on a typical day with 9.94 hours of sedentary time.    Researchers assessed kids for nine different symptoms of depression and found on average, kids had 0.52 symptoms at ages 6 and 10, with 0.46 at age 8.    Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity at 6 and 8 predicted fewer symptoms of major depressive disorder two years later, with every extra hour of such activity linked with a moderate decrease in symptoms.    The study didn’t find an association between inactivity and symptoms of depression, however.    One limitation of the study is that symptoms of depression don’t necessarily mean children would have a clinical diagnosis of depression, the authors note in Pediatrics.    In fact, only a few children had diagnoses of major depressive order: 0.3 percent of participants at age six, and 0.4 percent by age eight.    The study is also observational, and can’t show how any amount of exercise might cause kids to become depressed.    Even so, there are many possible biological explanations for why exercise might make depression less likely in kids, said Dr. Gary Goldfield, a psychology researcher at the University of Ottawa in Canada who wasn’t involved in the study.    For one thing, exercise releases several chemicals in the brain that can improve mood or reduce feelings of depression including endorphins, serotonin and dopamine, Goldfield said. Physical activity can also lead to lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol.    “Physical activity can also reduce depression through many psychosocial processes such as reduced stress, increased social interaction, improved cognition, learning and academic performance as well as increased self-esteem, body image and quality of life which can positively impact mood,” Goldfield added by email.    The study results suggest that children, like adults, can get lasting benefits from regular exercise, said Dr. Larry Rosen, professor emeritus of psychology at California State University, Dominguez Hills.    “The message seems clear,” Rosen, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Exercise now keeps you feeling better later.”  "
2jfiYBJ,2017-01-10,Breastfed babies still need extra vitamin D," (Reuters Health) - Many breastfed infants may not get enough vitamin D because their mothers prefer not to give babies supplement drops, a study suggests.                     A mother breastfeeds her child as she joins dozens of mothers during a breastfeeding flash mob demonstration at a public place in Hong Kong June 14, 2014. REUTERS/Bobby Yip      Pediatricians recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed infants until at least six months of age because it can reduce babies’ risk of ear and respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, allergies, childhood obesity and diabetes.   Because breast milk typically doesn’t contain enough vitamin D to help infants develop healthy bones, the American Academy of Pediatrics advises nursing mothers to give their babies daily supplements of 400 IU (international units) of vitamin D. As an alternative, women can take vitamin D supplements themselves – typically 4,000 to 6,000 IU daily – to give babies enough in breast milk so that drops aren’t needed.   The research team surveyed 184 breastfeeding mothers, including 44 mothers who also gave their babies formula in addition to breast milk.   Altogether, just 55 percent of the women said they gave their babies vitamin D drops and only 42 percent supplemented with the recommended 400 IU.    “Many mothers were not aware of the need for vitamin D supplementation or their physician had not recommended supplementation,” said senior study author Dr. Tom Thacher, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.    “Others believed that breast milk had all the needed nutrition, and some mentioned the inconvenience of giving a supplement or their poor experience of giving a supplement to previous children,” Thacher added by email.    Severe vitamin D deficiency can lead to rickets, or soft bones, seizures due to low calcium or heart failure in infants. While adults may get some vitamin D from sunlight, direct sun exposure isn’t recommended for babies.    About 76 percent of mothers said they took vitamin D themselves, and most of them preferred daily supplements to longer-acting versions taken less often. Overall, nearly nine in 10 women said they would prefer to take supplements themselves rather than give drops to their babies.    Women who didn’t give babies vitamin D most often cited safety concerns, the survey found.    One limitation of the study is that it included mostly white mothers, and the findings might not apply to women of other racial or ethnic groups or with a high risk of vitamin D deficiency, the authors note in the Annals of Family Medicine.    Still, the findings highlight the need to educate new parents about vitamin D and make sure breastfeeding mothers take supplements themselves or give babies drops, said Dr. Lydia Furman, a researcher at Case Western Reserve University and Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.    “Infants can only receive adequate vitamin D if their mothers receive adequate vitamin D and thus there is adequate vitamin D in their breast milk, or if they are supplemented,” Furman, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Some infant formulas may contain enough vitamin D to make drops unnecessary. But babies who consume both breast milk and formula may not get enough vitamin D and still need drops or mothers who take supplements.    Many women who breastfeed incorrectly believe that this gives babies all the nutrients they need, said Dr. Carol Wagner of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.    “There is an inherent belief that breast milk is the perfect food for their baby,” Wagner, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    It’s no surprise women prefer taking supplements themselves, because infant drops can be hard to remember and hard to get babies to swallow, Wagner added.    “We have found that mothers are more apt to take medications and vitamin supplements themselves than to give anything to their infants,” Wagner said. “It is much easier to give a vitamin to an adult than to an infant.”  "
2jfI1EM,2017-01-10,Men who eat lots of red meat have higher risk for common bowel disease," (Reuters Health) - A new study suggests that men who eat lots of red meat are much more likely to have bowel problems, pain and nausea than their peers who stick mainly with chicken or fish.                     Individual packages of steak are shown with labels at a meat shop in San Francisco, California June 5, 2015.  REUTERS/Robert Galbraith      Researchers examined more than two decades of data on more than 46,000 men and found frequent red meat eaters were 58 percent more likely to be diagnosed with diverticulitis, a common bowel condition that occurs when small pockets or bulges lining the intestines become inflamed.    “Previous studies have shown that a high fiber diet is associated with a lower risk of diverticulitis, however, the role of other dietary factors in influencing risk of diverticulitis was not well studied,” said senior study author Andrew Chan, a researcher at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.    “Our result show that diets high in red meat may be associated with a higher risk of diverticulitis,” Chan added by email.    Diverticulitis is common, resulting in more than 200,000 hospitalizations a year in the U.S. at a cost of more than $2 billion, Chan and colleagues note in the journal Gut.    New cases are on the rise, and the exact causes are unknown, although the condition has been linked to smoking, obesity and the use of certain nonprescription painkillers known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).   While diverticulitis can often be treated with a liquid or low-fiber diet, severe cases may require hospitalization and surgery to fix complications like perforations in the gut wall.    Researchers examined data collected on men who were aged 40 to 75 when they joined the study between 1986 and 2012. Every four years men were asked how often, on average, they ate red meat, poultry and fish over the preceding year.   They were given nine options, ranging from ‘never’ or ‘less than once a month,’ to ‘six or more times a day.’    During the study period, 764 men developed diverticulitis.   Men who ate the most red meat were also more likely to smoke, more likely to regularly take NSAIDs, and less likely to eat foods with fiber or get intense exercise.   By contrast, men who ate more chicken and fish were less likely to smoke or take NSAIDs and more likely to get vigorous exercise.    After accounting for these other factors that can influence the risk of diverticulitis, red meat was still associated with higher odds of developing the bowel disorder.    Each daily serving of red meat was associated with an 18 percent increased risk, the study found.    Unprocessed meats like beef, pork and lamb were associated with a greater risk than processed meats like bacon or sausage.    It’s possible the higher cooking temperatures typically used to prepare unprocessed meats may influence the composition of bacteria in the gut or inflammatory activity, though the exact reason for the increased risk tied to these foods is unknown, the researchers note.   Swapping one daily serving of red meat for chicken or fish was associated with a 20 percent reduction in the risk of this bowel disorder, the study also found.    The study is observational, and doesn’t prove red meat causes diverticulitis.    Other limitations of the study include its reliance on men to accurately recall and report how much meat they ate and the possibility that the results may not apply to women, the authors point out.    Even so, the findings should offer yet another reason to consider cutting back on red meat, said Samantha Heller, a nutritionist at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York City who wasn’t involved in the study.                     Bacon is fried up in a pan in a kitchen in this photo illustration in Golden, Colorado, October 26, 2015. REUTERS/Rick Wilking      Diets high in red and processed meats have been linked with increased risks of inflammatory bowel diseases, so the link found in this study “is not surprising,” Heller said by email.    “Focusing on a more plant based, higher fiber diet that includes legumes, whole grains, nuts, vegetables and fruits, replete with appropriate fluid intake, may go a long way in helping reduce of inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticulitis, and other chronic diseases,” Heller added.

2jmu4nv,2017-01-09,"In Obamacare era, older women get more cancer screenings"," (Reuters Health) - The number of older women in the U.S. being screened for breast cancer increased after the Affordable Care Act (ACA) became law in 2010 and free preventive healthcare was guaranteed, according to a new study.   Researchers also found that when the law - often referred to as Obamacare - went into effect, differences in screening rates between wealthy, well-educated older women and their less well-off peers became narrower.   “If you remove financial barriers, it will increase the uptake of at least certain services and narrow the gap,” said lead author Dr. Gregory Cooper, of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center and the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center in Ohio.   Cooper and his colleagues write in the journal Cancer that a major goal of the 2010 law was to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for certain preventive healthcare services, including screenings for breast and colon cancers.   It was hoped, the researchers write, that the change would allow more people with limited financial resources to be screened, narrowing the cancer disparities that exist among women with different social and economic statuses.   The researchers analyzed data collected between 2009 and 2012 from a sample of people on Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, to see if eliminating out of pocket costs had closed the gap between rich and poor and led to more mammograms and colonoscopies. Study subjects were at least 70 years old.   Prior to the ACA’s implementation in 2011, people on Medicare paid 20 percent of the cost for mammograms and 25 percent of the cost for colonoscopies, according to the authors of the study.    After the law made the services available at no expense to the patient, mammogram rates appeared to increase among women of all income and education levels.   The breast cancer screening gap between wealthy and poor Medicare recipients did narrow, the researchers found. Before passage of the ACA, the poorest women were 13 percent less likely to get screening mammograms than the richest women. After the law took effect, poor women were only 6 percent less likely to be screened than their wealthier peers.   Similar narrowing was seen in the gap between highly educated and less well-educated women.   The same was not true for colonoscopies.   Colonoscopies are more complicated than mammograms, however. They require more effort from patients, who need to prep themselves before the procedure, and patients may require sedation.   “For things that are more involved, cost may be only one step that needs to be addressed,” Cooper said.   Also, he noted, colonoscopies may still result in costs to patients if doctors remove polyps during the procedure, because the procedure would then be classified as “diagnostic” instead of “preventative.”   It’s unclear how the what will happen to these trends if Congress repeals the ACA, Cooper said.   “I’m hoping that they will keep some preventive service no matter what they end up doing,” he said.

2jw79ua,2017-01-09,Mammograms tied to overdiagnosis of breast cancer," (Reuters Health) - Widespread breast cancer screening may catch more small, slow-growing tumors that are unlikely to be fatal without curbing the diagnosis of advanced cancer cases, a Danish study suggests.    Diagnosis rates for early-stage tumors and pre-invasive malignancies known as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) have surged in recent years as more women get screening mammograms.   The current study offers fresh evidence linking routine screening to over-diagnosis of non-aggressive tumors because it compares outcomes over a single time period in two regions of Denmark – one that offered biennial mammography for women aged 50 to 69 and one that didn’t.    “Overdiagnosis means that healthy women get unnecessary breast cancer diagnoses,” said lead study author Dr. Karsten Juhl Jorgensen, of the Nordic Cochrane Center and Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen.   “A breast cancer diagnosis is a life-changing event for the woman and her family, with substantial implications for their quality of life,” Jorgensen added by email. “It also leads to overtreatment with surgery, radiotherapy and sometimes chemotherapy – we know these treatments have serious, sometimes lethal, consequences.”   The goal of mammograms is to detect tumors before they can be felt in a physical breast exam, catching cancer sooner when it’s easier to treat. Ideally, this should mean fewer women are diagnosed when tumors are bigger, rapidly growing, and harder to attack.    To see how well mammograms achieve this ideal, researchers examined data on more than 1.4 million Danish women aged 35 to 84 from 1980 to 2010.    Organized breast cancer screening programs began in Copenhagen in 1991, Funen in 1993 and Frederiksberg in 1994 – altogether covering about 20 percent of the population. Other regions gradually introduced screening starting in 2007.   Screening wasn’t associated with a lower incidence of advanced tumors, researchers report in the Annals of Internal Medicine.    This raises doubts about whether mammography reduces breast cancer deaths, the researchers conclude.    In addition, researchers estimate that as many as one in three breast tumors diagnosed in women who got mammograms would never have caused a noticeable health problem or led to death – and are therefore examples of overdiagnosis.     One limitation of the study is that because mammography has improved since this study began in 1980, women might get different results today, the authors note.    While the study adds compelling evidence that routine mammograms carry a risk of overdiagnosis, that doesn’t mean it’s time for screening guidelines to change, Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said in a phone interview.    Under current U.S. guidelines, mammograms should be optional for women aged 40 to 44, then done annually from 45 to 54. Women 55 and older should switch to mammograms every two years, continuing as long as they are in good health with a life expectancy of at least a decade.    “This isn’t about saying don’t get a mammogram, this is about using it most effectively to save the most lives,” said Brawley, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study.    Beyond screening, there are other preventive measures women shouldn’t overlook like eating well, getting plenty of exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight.   In the future, it may be possible to use screening results to pinpoint women who might be candidates for “watchful waiting,” the close follow-up without treatment that’s common for many men with early-stage prostate cancer, Brawley said.    “We aren’t ready for that because we don’t know what watchful waiting looks like for breast cancer yet,” Brawley said.    So for now, that means accepting that overdiagnosis and screening go hand in hand, along with the potential for some women to get unnecessary treatment.    “If it’s small and slow-growing, I think all breast cancers ought to be treated,” Brawley added.

2j1JY9Q,2017-01-10,Do rude parents mean worse care for babies?," (Reuters Health) - The stress of having a sick baby in the hospital can be enough to make even the nicest parent take some of their fears and frustrations out on the doctors and nurses.    But a new study suggests infants may receive better care if their parents take a deep breath and try harder to be nice. That’s because rudeness by parents was linked to worse performances by medical teams that care for babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), researchers report in Pediatrics.    Lots of previous research has shown that exposure to even mildly rude behavior can cause individuals to perform poorly on cognitive tasks, become less creative and flexible, and act less social and helpful, said lead study author Dr. Arieh Riskin of the University of Tel Aviv in Israel.    “However, this current study is the first to demonstrate – what we all feel and know from our experience in our daily practice – that exposure to rudeness inflicted on medical teams by patients or families of patients significantly harm medical teams’ performance,” Riskin said by email.   “Rudeness had adverse consequences not only on diagnostic and intervention parameters of medical care, but also on team processes – such as information and workload sharing, helping and communication – that are central to patient care,” Riskin added.    For the study, 39 NICU medical teams participated in training workshops including simulations of care for critically ill newborns and preemies.    The teams were told they were participating in a training exercise in debriefing techniques to discuss team performance. They didn’t know the true purpose of the experiment was to test their response to rudeness.    In each workshop, two teams were randomly assigned to experience one of two scenarios, played by actors: a mother making rude comments unrelated to the clinicians’ performance or a mother making neutral inoffensive remarks.    Another two teams were randomly assigned to first participate in computer-game exercises or writing-and-discussion exercises designed to help them deal with rudeness, before being exposed to the rudeness scenario.    Researchers tested scenarios that are common in the NICU like treating babies with severe jaundice, shock tied to life-threatening bleeding, or potentially fatal breathing difficulties or reduced oxygen flow to the brain.    Judges observing the workshops rated how well teams performed tasks like diagnosing problems, creating treatment plans, sharing information, helping one another with patients, and communication.    Teams exposed to rude mothers did worse at diagnosis, treatment planning, information and workload sharing than when they experienced mothers making neutral remarks, the study found.    Teams that did computer exercises designed to help them understand and cope with rudeness before they went through the scenario with the rude mother did better than teams that did the discussion-based exercises.    Beyond its small size, limitations of the study include the possibility that clinicians might perform differently in real-life situations than in workshops.    Even so, the findings offer fresh evidence of the ways rudeness can have an impact beyond just the person it’s aimed at, said Dr. Sandy Hershcovis, a business researcher at the University of Calgary in Canada who wasn’t involved in the study.    “As in all contexts, rude behavior is an ineffective approach to getting the best service,” Hershcovis added by email.    The findings also highlight the need for doctors, nurses and other clinicians to be mindful of how they communicate and learn how to be respectful and deal with difficult patients, said Christine Porath, a researcher at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business in Washington, D.C.   Parents, too, should mind their manners even when they’re frustrated and upset.    “People – including your child’s doctors, nurses and other clinicians – can’t focus or process information as well when they are even around rudeness,” Porath, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “Your best shot at great care is to convey your message respectfully,” Porath added. “Express your concern and wishes passionately and compassionately; don’t insult, belittle, or demean them.”  "
2iWTY4i,2017-01-09,`Cybercycling’ during gym class tied to better school behavior," (Reuters Health) - Kids with behavioral problems may do better in school when they get to play virtual-reality games on stationary bikes instead of participating in traditional gym class activities, a small study suggests.    At a school for kids with behavior disorders, researchers offered 103 students seven weeks of so-called “cybercycling” during either the fall or spring semester.    Cybercycling involves the use of stationary bikes for vigorous rides. The students started out cycling for just 10 minutes and worked their way up to more than 20 minutes over the course of the program.   When students didn’t participate in the twice-weekly games on stationary bikes, they had traditional physical education with a focus on team sports, socialization and building motor skills.    When kids did cybercycling, they were 32 to 51 percent less likely to exhibit poor self-control or receive disciplinary time out of class, the study found.    Improvements were most pronounced on days the kids had gym but persisted throughout the seven-week intervention.    “Many studies have shown that aerobic exercise can help improve mood and behavior,” said lead study author April Bowling, a public health researcher at Harvard University in Boston.    “When mood and self-regulation, which is the ability to control behavior, is improved, then children can be more successful in the classroom,” Bowling added by email.    While the study didn’t examine how or why different approaches to gym class might produce different behavior in school, it’s possible the more intense aerobic activity offered by cybercycling produced better behavior and helped improve classroom dynamics throughout the week, Bowling said.    Most of the students were boys, about 12 years old on average.    About 40 percent of the students were diagnosed with autism, 60 percent were diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, 40 percent had anxiety disorders and 30 percent had mood disorders.    Both the number of disciplinary events and the amount of time missed from class due to behavior issues declined meaningfully during weeks kids participated in the cybercycling program, researchers report in Pediatrics.    Beyond its small size and limited number of female participants, another limitation of the study is that results from these students at a therapeutic day school may not apply to kids at traditional public schools, the authors note.    “It is important to see if their results translate into public schools, but as the authors point out, cybercycles are expensive and may be (too expensive) for most schools,” said Sara Benjamin Neelon, a public health researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.    It’s also possible that the novelty of these particular stationary bikes, which many students wouldn’t have tried before, might inspire them to be more active than they would be during gym class games they played many times before, Benjamin Neelon said by email.    “There may be some benefit in this new approach to physical activity that could wear off over time as children get used to the cycling - but only time will tell,” she added.    Still, the findings suggest that parents looking to help children manage behavior problems may want to consider working brief bouts of intense exercise into kids’ normal routines, Bowling said.    “They should not feel overwhelmed by the expectation that their child can only benefit if they exercise for 30 to 60 minutes, something that is very hard for many of these children and their parents to achieve,” Bowling added.  “Instead, focus on finding something that your child enjoys and starting off with 10 or 15 minutes at a time; walking the dog, hiking with you, playing active video games, whatever it might be.”  "
2hMYPVi,2017-01-09,Size matters: Study shows big difference in office visit reimbursements," (Reuters Health) - An analysis of 15.3 million doctor office visits shows that physicians get paid significantly more if they are part of a large provider group, while insurance companies can dramatically reduce what they pay doctors for those visits if they’ve consolidated their share of the marketplace.   The study in Health Affairs puts some hard numbers to a basic economic concept of market dominance and the bargaining that accompanies it.   In 2014, an insurance company with less than 5 percent of the market typically paid $86 for a basic office visit. Just increasing their market share to 5 to 15 percent reduced the average amount the insurer paid to $70, or 18 percent less.   But those amounts varied depending on the size of the healthcare provider.   Providers with only a small share of the market typically received $88 for an office visit from an insurance company with less than 5 percent of the market. But when the insurance company commanded at least 15 percent of the market, that office visit earned the provider just $70 per visit.   When a large healthcare provider controlled at least 15 percent of the local market share, it could get an extra $9 per visit (or $97) from insurance companies with a small market share and $6 more (or $76) from insurers with a large market share.   The same pricing pattern was seen for office visits when patients had more complex problems, the researchers found.   When it comes to consolidation efforts, “we’re showing that for insurers it lowers prices and with providers it increases prices,” coauthor J. Michael McWilliams of Harvard Medical School in Boston told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “It’s really uncertain where that will end up. But in the process, we are losing competition in both markets. And when markets become less competitive, consumers generally lose out.”   The authors estimated that every time a provider’s market share went up 10 percentage points, the amount received for an uncomplicated office visit rose by an average of $3.16. The increase was $6.23 for a visit with a patient with complicated problems.   “Those are underestimates,” said McWilliams, the Warren Alpert associate professor of health care policy, “because we could measure provider market power less well than we could insurer market power.”   The study comes amid concern that a consolidation of healthcare providers, particularly hospitals, might give them more power to raise prices and that a similar consolidation of health insurance companies might make prices artificially low. Aetna, Anthem, Cigna and Humana, four of the largest insurers in the United States, are working on mergers. Previous research has shown that when providers consolidate, prices go up.   Unlike previous work, the new study looked at price data for multiple insurers covering patients in many markets, taking into account market share and the bargaining power that comes with it. The study also revealed how the same insurer can pay significantly different amounts to different practices.   The numbers were based on data from each insurer’s preferred provider organization and point-of-service plans. Data where it was clear that out-of-network billing was involved were excluded, as were visits to outpatient facilities and offices owned by hospitals.   “Insurers consolidating to negotiate lower prices and providers negotiating to produce higher prices produces an unclear effect on prices in the end,” McWilliams said. “So, in the end, this cycle of insurer-provider consolidation may be a zero sum game.”   He and his colleagues do not offer a specific solution.   “It’s unclear whether regulations can be smart enough to insure savings get passed along to consumers,” said McWilliams. “The horse has left the barn in many markets in terms of provider-insurer markets already being pretty concentrated. So we do need to consider some new forms of regulation.”  "
2hYh4Iq,2017-01-06,Bystander CPR may boost survival odds when ambulance delayed," (Reuters Health) - Cardiac arrest patients who get cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from a bystander at the scene may have better survival odds even when an ambulance takes a long time to arrive, a Danish study suggests.    Researchers examined data on 7,623 cardiac arrest patients and found when an ambulance arrived within five minutes of a 911 call, patients were 2.3 times more likely to survive at least 30 days if they received bystander CPR than if they didn’t get this aid at the scene.    When ambulances took up to 10 minutes to arrive, bystander CPR was associated with tripled survival odds, the study also found. After 13 minutes, patients who got CPR at the scene continued to have better survival odds but the difference was no longer statistically meaningful.    “Early CPR saves lives, and the lack of CPR efforts from bystanders could result in significantly decreased chances of survival,” said lead study author Dr. Shahzleen Rajan of Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark.   Cardiac arrest involves the abrupt loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness. Unlike a heart attack, which happens when blood flow to a portion of the heart is blocked, cardiac arrest occurs when the heart’s electrical system malfunctions, often due to irregular heart rhythms. Cardiac arrest may occur with no warning and is often fatal.   Chest compressions or CPR can help restore circulation, increasing the odds of survival. Bystander CPR generally won’t restore a normal heart rhythm but it can buy time by maintaining blood flow to vital organs.    “We know from previous research that 1 in 8 people survive after a cardiac arrest if a bystander initiates CPR before the arrival of the emergency medical services,” Rajan said by email. “In contrast, if CPR is not initiated before the arrival of the emergency medical services, only 1 in 30 people survive a cardiac arrest.”   For the current study, researchers looked at 30-day survival for patients who had cardiac arrests outside of a hospital between 2005 and 2011.    When the ambulance arrived within five minutes, 14.5 percent of patients in the bystander CPR group survived at least 30 days, compared with 6.3 percent in the group that didn’t get this help.   For ambulance arrival times up to ten minutes, 6.7 percent in the CPR group and 2.2 percent of the other patients survived. If the ambulance took more than 13 minutes, the survival rate was 3.7 percent in the CPR group and 1.5 percent for the others - a difference that wasn’t statistically meaningful.   The study is observational and doesn’t prove bystander CPR increases survival odds, the authors note in Circulation. Researchers also lacked data on how quickly bystanders intervened after the start of cardiac arrest, which could influence outcomes, the authors note.    “Once a victim has sustained a cardiac arrest with little or no blood supply going to the heart or brain, the time to reestablishing blood flow with oxygenated blood is critical,” said Dr. Lenworth Jacobs, director of trauma and emergency medicine at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut.   “It is generally thought that the sooner this is implemented the better,” Jacobs, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.   The biggest obstacle to bystander CPR remains that too few people know how to do it, said Dr. Peter Pons, an emergency physician in Denver and professor emeritus at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.   “Clearly, if someone has been motivated to learn and has been taught CPR, they will often assist,” Pons, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “When someone does not have that knowledge, they tend to be more reluctant to act and may fear making things worse.”  "
2hZtefp,2017-01-06,Few black diabetes patients in U.S. drug trials," (Reuters Health) - Even though diabetes rates are almost twice as high in black people as in whites, black patients may be far less likely to be included in drug safety trials, a recent study suggests.   Since 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has required that new glucose-lowering medications for diabetes be tested for cardiovascular safety, which may differ based on patients’ race or ethnicity, researchers note in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology.    When researchers looked at seven diabetes drug trials done since then to test cardiovascular safety, they found that in five of the trials, black people made up less than 5 percent of the patients.   “In the United States the burden of diabetes and the serious complications associated with it fall unfairly on minorities, particularly African Americans, yet it appears that they are under-represented in clinical trials of new therapies and devices,” said study co-author Dr. David Kerr of the William Sansum Diabetes Center in Santa Barbara, California.    “If they are excluded they may be exposed to therapies which may not work or could cause harm,” Kerr added by email. “The therapies are also likely to be expensive and ineffective.”   About 13 percent of black people in the U.S. have diabetes, compared with 7.6 percent of white Americans.    Death rates from cardiovascular disease are also disproportionately high among black Americans, the researchers point out.   When it comes to drug effectiveness and safety, self-identified race doesn’t necessarily predict response to a treatment or suggest that outcomes would be similar among patients of different races.   Still, the majority of cardiovascular studies in recent decades have focused on white heterosexual males, noted Dr. Andrew Krumerman, of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in New York.    “The current study confirms the notion that African American subjects are poorly represented in large cardiovascular outcome trials,” Krumerman, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.    When drug trial participation isn’t balanced across gender, race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status, it can be easy to miss critical distinctions in how treatments may work in different types of people, said Dr. Keith Ferdinand, of Tulane School of Medicine in New Orleans. “Certain groups of patients may respond differently to the same therapies.”   There are examples beyond just diabetes. For example, studies have found two types of blood pressure drugs don’t work as well in black patients as other people, and one medicine for heart failure works very well in black patients but not in white patients, Ferdinand, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “For some time we have known high risk minority populations have been underrepresented in clinical trials,” said Dr. Daniel Lackland, a researcher at Medical University of South Carolina who wasn’t involved in the study.    “This major issue is not limited to diabetes studies but also cancer and other clinical trials,” Lackland added by email.

2jjsCXf,2017-01-06,Holocaust survivors remember with resilience," (Reuters Health) - Can traumatic memories foster endurance and contentment in the present? Researchers asked that question when they examined reminiscences reported by Holocaust survivors in Israel.   The survivors integrate memories of horror and loss in their lives with a sense of resilience, the researchers found.   “Even though they’re haunted by memories, they’ve carved out lives with families and careers,” said study coauthor Norm O’Rourke, a psychologist at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Be’er Sheva, Israel.   They “do not define their lives based on trauma and loss, but on their ability to rise from the ashes and bear witness to the past to help secure the future,” O’Rourke’s team writes in The Gerontologist.   O’Rourke and colleagues interviewed 269 Holocaust survivors in Israel who lived under Nazi rule and immigrated as refugees after World War II or the fall of the Soviet Union. Only five discontinued the interviews out of discomfort when discussing the past.    “As they talked about what happened, it wasn’t something that occurred 70 years ago,” O’Rourke told Reuters Health. “It sounds like it happened yesterday, which is part of the nature of trauma.”   Three themes - bridging past and present, rebuilding families and the Jewish state, and having a duty to share - came up often.   The researchers asked survivors how often they reminisced and why. They never asked participants to recall events specifically about the Holocaust, but most did. For many, the Holocaust is still a silent presence in daily life.   The survivors also focused on rebuilding their lives, as well as the Jewish state in Israel.   “One of the ways in which I coped with my memories was not to return to my home before the war,” one man said. “Instead, I came to Israel in 1949 soon after the state was born. From that day forward, I rebuilt my life. This has accompanied me in all I have done.”   They also expressed a duty to share memories with others, such as grandchildren or soldiers, so the history isn’t forgotten.   “I survived by chance alone; so I decided that in exchange for my life, I would share my story with youth and young adults,” one man said. “. . . I will share my memories because in a few years, people my age will be gone and unable to testify. I was there.”   Interestingly, no participants shared memories with children - only grandchildren, senior groups, soldiers and students. This was typical after the war because survivors didn’t want to traumatize their children, the study authors wrote.   “It is remarkable how survivors have integrated memories of loss and trauma into their life narratives,” said Sarah Canham, a study author at the Gerontology Research Center at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia.    “Holocaust survivors are not mired in the past,” she told Reuters Health. “Instead, they have come to define their choices and achievements in life against a backdrop of death and survival.”   One limitation is that the study doesn’t include those who emigrated to the United States, Canada and Australia after World War II.   “The survivor communities in New York City and Los Angeles are large, and their memories and ways of coping are likely different,” O’Rourke said. “From what we know, those who are still alive are the heartiest of the hearty.”   The average age of the cohort was 80, which could also give insight into memories and mental health in old age, said Jose Paulo Fiks, a psychologist at Federal University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. Fiks, who was not involved with this study, researches transgenerational trauma and resilience.   “In traumatic situations, memory has always been the most challenging field to understand, specifically for mental health purposes,” he told Reuters Health by email. “This article, perhaps for the first time, studies traumatic memory as an integrating element of existence.”  "
2j8bL5F,2017-01-06,Girls from low-income families often unprepared for puberty," (Reuters Health) – - American girls from low-income families often feel unprepared for puberty and have mostly negative experiences during that time, a review of previous studies suggests.    Earlier research focused on experiences of middle-class and affluent girls in the 1980s and 1990s. The current study is one of the first to focus on girls from low-income urban areas in the U.S.   “Lower income girls do not feel adequately prepared for puberty and the beginning of menstruation (menarche), particularly girls who develop earlier than their peers,” study leader Ann Herbert told Reuters Health by email.   “By not adequately preparing girls for this transition, we are neglecting an opportunity to build a healthy foundation for sexual and reproductive health,” said Herbert, who is a researcher with the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York City.    As reported in the Journal of Adolescent Health, Herbert and colleagues analyzed data from 20 studies of the psychosocial aspects of puberty in low-income girls published between 2000 and 2014.    They looked at five general issues: the content of girls’ experiences with puberty; the quality of those experiences; the messages they received about puberty; their relationships with other people; and other factors that might have affected their experiences.    Most girls reported negative experiences during puberty, usually related to their periods, when they felt embarrassed, confused and scared. Also, many girls felt the need to hide their breast development or were told to distance themselves from males.    One study participant remarked, “I did not want to be around boys . . . When I started my period, I really had a nice little figure and really did not want no one to see my figure so I wore baggy clothes and dressed like a boy and stuff so boys would not be interested in me.”   The girls usually felt the information they received from mothers, sisters or teachers was inaccurate, insufficient or came too late, researchers found.   “It was somewhat surprising to see how common it is for these girls, who live in low-income families, to not get adequate information about puberty. Also that some girls actually start menstruating before knowing what it is and that it is going to happen to them,” Herbert said.   She said the girls clearly wanted to discuss puberty with their parents, especially their mothers, but commonly complained that discussions about menstruation went straight to warnings about avoiding pregnancy.    “Parents don’t seem to realize that jumping from menstruation straight to pregnancy prevention means they are skipping over a lot of important information such as how menstruation works, why it happens, and how to predict when your period will come,” Herbert said.   As a result, Herbert said, girls are left feeling confused about what is going on with their bodies.   The finding that girls want their parents and other trusted adults to be the sources of information means part of the solution involves supporting parents in this role, Herbert said.    She and her colleagues are developing puberty educational tools with top artists. “We are using design principles to translate what we are finding from the research into educational tools that can help girls communicate and reflect on these topics with trusted adults,” she said.   Julianna Deardorff, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health who wasn’t involved in the new research, said the study has important implications for pubertal education, particularly for lower-income girls who are clearly missing out on key information.    “Puberty education often happens too late in schools, sometimes as late as the 6th or 7th grades, well after most girls have started breast development and have begun menstruating,” Deardorff told Reuters Health by email.   Earlier and better preparation is critical, especially if we are going to support our most vulnerable youth during this important developmental transition, Deardorff said.    “My colleague Louise Greenspan, co-author of The New Puberty, and I recommend that schools start puberty education in fall semester of 4th grade to ensure that early developers have much-needed information before they are in the throes of this transition,” she said.

2j5c9l1,2017-01-05,"For seniors, having a partner helps cut hip fracture risk"," NEW YORK (Reuters Health) – - Research from Spain confirms that senior women are three times more likely than their male peers to fracture a hip but also finds risk factors differ for men and women.    Illiteracy and depression increase the risks of fracture for senior women, while smoking and disability raise the risk for senior men.    Dementia doesn’t increase the risk of hip fractures, but being married or having a partner does reduce the risk for men and women, say the authors.   Each year, more than 300,000 Americans over the age of 65 are hospitalized for hip fractures, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About three out of four hip fractures occur in women.    The study, published in Maturitas, was led by Elena Lobo of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health at Zaragoza University in Spain.   Lobo and colleagues analyzed medical and psychiatric histories for 4,803 adults in Zaragoza over the age of 55, including the number of hip fractures.   Participants were 73 years old, on average. Over the course of 16 years, about 8 percent of women broke a hip, compared to less than 3 percent of men.   Among the women in the study, being unable to read increased the risk of hip fracture by about 50 percent and being diagnosed with depression increased the risk by 44 percent.   For the men, smoking doubled the risk of hip fracture and being disabled tripled the risk.    “It is well documented that smoking is harmful to bone health,” Dr. Heike Bischoff-Ferrari told Reuters Health in an email.    “Additionally, most important at older age – smoking reduces calorie intake,” she added. The U.S. National Institutes of Health warns that being underweight is a risk factor for poor bone health.   Bischoff-Ferrari, who chairs the Geriatrics and Aging Research Department at University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, said disability as a risk factor makes a lot of sense.   “Disability increases the risk of falling and falling is the primary risk factor for hip fractures,” said Bischoff-Ferrari, who wasn’t involved in the new study. “Disability also has a direct effect on bone and muscle health as disability reduces mobility – and thereby loss of both bone and muscle mass is the consequence – enhancing the risk of falls and hip fractures.”    Men who were coupled were half as likely to suffer a hip fracture and women who were married or lived with someone were 30 percent less likely to break a hip.   Bischoff-Ferrari said this finding also makes sense because seniors who live with a partner are less likely to be malnourished or depressed and more likely to have support with a possible disability.   “All of those risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of falling and sustaining a hip fracture,” she said.   Bischoff-Ferrari said it’s not clear why the study did not capture dementia as a risk factor when previous findings have shown that cognitive impairment is increasing the risk of falls and fractures.   “One explanation may be the correlation of risk factors – for example, we know that physical and cognitive impairment are closely correlated. The authors had both risk factors in their model, which may have led to the missing signal for dementia,” she said.   She has some advice for reducing the risk of hip fractures.   “It is well documented that clearing the apartment of seniors from fall hazards, such as loose carpets, is effective, as is better lighting and hand grips to hold on to in the bathroom,” Bischoff-Ferrari said.   Bischoff-Ferrari said it’s also important to make sure that older adults are consuming an adequate number of calories. Their diet should focus on calcium and protein rich foods to prevention bone and muscle mass loss.   Bischoff-Ferrari added that exercise - for example, walking 30 minutes each day - has been shown to reduce the risk of hip fracture.    “Last but not least, a vitamin D supplement of 800 International Units per day has been shown to correct vitamin D deficiency and reduce falls and hip fractures by up to 30 percent,” she said.   The authors of the study did not respond to a request for comment.  "
2jfX3xn,2017-01-06,Feeding puréed peanuts to infants can reduce allergy risk," (Reuters Health) - Parents should feed babies creamy peanut butter or puréed food with nut powder when infants are 4 to 6 months old to help lower the risk of life-threatening allergies, new U.S. guidelines urge.    For most babies — kids without severe eczema or egg allergies that make peanut allergies more likely — new guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommend introducing foods containing peanuts as soon as babies are able to tolerate other solid foods.   “For most infants, introduction can be done at home,” said allergist Dr. Matthew Greenhawt, chair of the food allergy committee for the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and a co-author of the guidelines.   “Whole peanuts should never be given to any child under the age of 4, as it they are a choking hazard,” Greenhawt added by email.    The new guidelines are a radical departure from recommendations in 2000 that advised against giving babies peanuts before age 3. Revised recommendations in 2008 had suggested no food be delayed past 4 to 6 months but failed offer specific guidance on when to feed babies peanuts.   Peanut allergies are a leading cause of death from food allergies in the U.S. and the new guidelines aim to alter this statistic by helping babies get an early taste that will make severe allergic reactions less likely.    Some allergic reactions can be mild with symptoms like hives or nausea, but more serious reactions can lead to anaphylaxis, when the airways tighten to the point where it’s impossible to breathe. People with anaphylaxis can die if they don’t get immediate medical help.   As doctors and parents change their approach to peanuts to follow the new guidelines, early exposure should help dramatically curb the number of children who develop severe allergies, doctors say.   Under the new guidelines, most babies can have peanuts introduced at home by parents or caregivers, but infants with severe eczema or egg allergies should see an allergist first. A specialist can test for peanut allergies and if necessary, give babies their first taste of peanuts during a doctor visit.    These precautions are for infants with severe eczema that doesn’t respond to treatment with moisturizer or corticosteroid creams or ointments, not babies with temporary rashes.    “Infants without severe eczema or egg allergy are unlikely to have peanut allergy by 4-6 months, although they still have a risk for developing peanut allergy later, especially if they are not fed peanut in early infancy,” Dr. Robert Boyle, a researcher at Imperial College London who wasn’t involved in the guidelines, said by email.   In infants without eczema or any food allergies, parents should feel comfortable giving babies a taste of peanuts after they are accustomed to eating other solid foods, said Dr. Sandra Hong, an allergy and immunology specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio who wasn’t involved in the new guidelines.    “These guidelines are different than what some doctors may be currently recommending because, previously, the practice was to avoid the highly allergenic foods for risk of developing an allergy,” Hong said by email.    The new advice follows trial results reported in February 2015 that showed regular peanut consumption begun in infancy and continued until 5 years of age led to an 81 percent reduction in development of peanut allergy in infants deemed at high risk because they already had severe eczema, egg allergy or both.   “Monumental trials have shown that prevention or food allergies can occur with early introduction of peanut and egg into the diet,” Hong said.   The guidelines are being published simultaneously in several journals including the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.  "
2hOzycM,2017-01-05,Parental obesity may be tied to developmental delays in kids," (Reuters Health) - Kids born to obese parents may be more likely to experience certain developmental delays early in childhood, a recent study suggests.    Based on parents’ reports, children with obese mothers were 67 percent more likely to have delayed fine motor skill development by age 3 compared to kids with normal or underweight mothers, even after accounting for the father’s weight, the study found.    With obese fathers, children were 71 percent more likely to have deficits in personal and social skills after taking their mothers’ weight into account, the study also found.    When both parents were obese, kids were almost three times more likely to struggle with problem-solving.    “The immediate take home message is that everyone - male or female, contemplating parenthood or not - should try to achieve a healthy body weight, through appropriate diet and lifestyle,” said lead study author Edwina Yeung, a researcher at the National Institutes of Health.   The study assessed delays based on questionnaires completed by parents, and so it can’t prove that obesity directly causes developmental problems, Yeung added by email.    “We don’t have actual diagnoses for the kids,” Yeung said. “At this point, we don’t know whether the kids will have problems, or whether they’ll outgrow what we found on the (screening questionnaires).”   Yeung and colleagues examined data from questionnaires parents completed for 3,759 singleton babies and 1,062 non-related twins, when the children were 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months old.    Questions screened for developmental delays in five areas: fine motor skills, gross motor skills, communication, personal and social functioning, and problem-solving ability.    Researchers examined the odds of developmental delays associated with parental obesity after accounting for other factors that can impact these milestones such as parents’ age, race or ethnicity, education and income levels, marital status, health insurance and smoking history.   Even though the study didn’t examine how parents’ obesity might influence child development, it’s possible obese mothers might have babies more prone to inflammation, which can in turn impact neurological development in children, the authors note in Pediatrics.   Obese fathers might pass certain genetic material on to their children that makes delays more likely, though less is known about how men’s weight impacts children, the researchers point out.    Limitations of the study include the lack of data from follow-up exams to confirm whether children actually had developmental deficits, the researchers wrote.    Still, the findings add to a growing body of evidence linking maternal obesity in particular to neurodevelopmental problems such as autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, said Elinor Sullivan, a researcher at the University of Portland and Oregon Health and Science University who wasn’t involved in the study.    “In an ideal scenario, the parents would be a healthy body weight prior to conception,” Sullivan added by email.    If parents are overweight or obese upon conception, there are still many things that they can do to benefit their child’s development, Sullivan said.   These include following a healthy diet, getting moderate or even mild exercise, and avoiding exposure to cigarette smoke, alcohol, and chemicals found in cleaning and personal hygiene products.  "
2hQWncN,2017-01-05,Room for improvement when young diabetics transition away from pediatricians," (Reuters Health) -    A survey of young patients with type 1 diabetes shows that the process of transitioning away from care by pediatricians could be improved.      “We still have some work to do in implementing the current practice guidelines regarding transition preparation and care coordination,” Dr. Katherine Garvey of Boston Children’s Hospital told Reuters Health by email. “We need to develop systems to help providers provide efficient, standardized transition preparation education and counseling for youth with diabetes.”    Dr. Garvey and her colleagues evaluated transition experiences via electronic survey in two groups of young adults with type 1 diabetes - 303 who were still receiving pediatric care and 299 who had already transitioned to adult care.    In the group still being cared for by pediatricians, the average anticipated age at transition to adult care was 22 years. Two thirds of this group were still in pediatric care because of emotional attachment to their provider.     “This attachment has previously been identified as a barrier to transition in patients with type 1 diabetes as well as more generally in pediatric patients with chronic health conditions and their parents and is an important area to directly address in patient counseling,” the authors note in their report in Diabetes Care.     More than 80 percent of respondents in the pediatric care group had discussed general diabetes self-management with their providers; 60 percent had discussed prescription refills and appointment scheduling; 55 percent had reviewed the need to transition or a specific transition plan; and fewer than 20 percent had received any written transition materials.    The group receiving care from “adult” doctors had transitioned away from pediatric care at age 19, on average, mainly after a recommendation by their pediatric provider; 63 percent said they had received a specific referral for an adult diabetes provider and 66 percent felt mostly/completely prepared to transition - and these patients had less diabetes-related distress and higher treatment adherence.   However, 21 percent of the adult-care group reported a gap of more than six months between pediatric and adult diabetes care. Those with fewer pretransition pediatric visits or who felt unprepared for transition were more apt to have a gap more than six months between pediatric and adult care.    Transition preparation counseling was not associated with self-reported blood sugar control in either group.    This study “offers a national perspective of young adult diabetes care experiences on both sides of the transition,” the authors note in their paper.    Recommended components of transition preparation include counseling on diabetes self-management and health risk behaviors, written transition plans, and specific adult provider referrals, they point out.    “We are still seeing deficiencies in important components of pediatric transition preparation counseling,” Dr. Garvey told Reuters Health. “Prioritizing transition preparation and planning may increase young adult engagement in care across the transition, and help protect them from gaps in care and adverse outcomes.”  "
2hTYIXx,2017-01-04,Gun violence is studied less than other major causes of death," (Reuters Health) - Research examining gun violence, and the funding to support it, significantly lags behind what would typically be expected for a major cause of death, according to a new study.   The amount of research on gun violence published between 2004 and 2014 was only 4.5 percent of what would be expected for a cause of death that kills more than 30,000 people in the United States each year, researchers say.    And the funding for that research was only 1.6 percent of what would be expected.   Compared to other leading causes of death, gun violence is “simply not being investigated in the same way,” said lead author Dr. David Stark, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.   Stark and his co-author Nigam Shah, of the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, write in JAMA that a 1996 U.S. law banned the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from using federal funding for injury prevention and control “to advocate or promote gun control.”   The stipulation and other restrictions soon spread beyond the CDC to other agencies and the research community, they add.   For the new study, the researchers analyzed data on published medical research and funding between 2004 and 2014 to see if the results for gun violence were in line with other major causes of death.   In both cases, research and research funding for gun violence was less than predicted, compared to other causes of death   Based on research and funding for the other top 30 major causes of death, as listed by the CDC, the researchers estimated $1.4 billion should have been spent on gun violence research over that decade, instead of the $22 million that was actually spent.   Gun violence should have also been the subject of an estimated 38,897 studies during that time, but only 1,738 were published.   The researchers say gun violence is on par with sepsis, a complication from infections, in number of deaths caused. Researchers investigating gun violence received less than 1 percent of the funding spent on sepsis, however. Likewise, the amount of published research on gun violence was only 4 percent of the volume for sepsis.   The study can’t prove the lack of funding or research on gun violence is due to the 1996 law, Stark told Reuters Health.   “Gun violence, which kills about 33,000 people per year, is a public health issue,” he said. “It’s no different than automobile accidents.”   Deaths due to automobile accidents have dropped thanks to research and the resulting interventions, such as car seats, seat belts and road barriers, he said.   “It’s important that people realize that research is an essential endeavor to not just learn more but to develop sensible policies and interventions in the real world,” said Stark. “Obtaining the data is really the first step.”  "
2hRhRpQ,2017-01-04,Common morning sickness drug may not work," (Reuters Health) - A pill routinely prescribed for morning sickness may not be an effective nausea remedy, researchers say - although not all doctors agree.   The warning comes from researchers who conducted a new analysis of a previously unpublished trial that was used to win marketing approval for the drug in the U.S. and Canada.    The drug, pyridoxine-doxylamine, is sold as Diclegis in the U.S. and Diclectin in Canada. It has been taken by millions of pregnant women since it was developed in the 1970s, researchers note in PLOS One. An older version of the medicine with an additional ingredient has been used as far back as the 1950s.    For the current study, researchers reviewed data from a decades-old trial and found little evidence that the medicine is effective, said study co-author Dr. Navindra Persaud, a researcher at St. Michael’s Hospital and the University of Toronto in Canada.    “This medication is recommended as the first-line treatment for nausea and vomiting during pregnancy,” Persaud said by email. “We now have more information about this 1970s study that should make us question whether this medication should have been approved and whether it was ever proven to be effective.”   The original trial in the 1970s was designed to determine if the drug could alleviate morning sickness in the first trimester of pregnancy.    To see if those results proved the drug effective, Persaud and co-author Dr. Rujun Zhang of the University of Toronto examined 36,000 pages of documents from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including the original study report, the protocol and summary results, and other documents from Health Canada.    About 2,300 pregnant women participated in the original trial at 14 clinics in the U.S., the researchers found. All of the women were experiencing nausea and vomiting in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.    Women were randomly assigned to eight treatment groups, including one that received a placebo or dummy pill and seven that received a variety of drugs including the combination currently sold as Diclectin.    Each participant was asked to take two tablets a day at bedtime and one additional pill in the afternoon as needed for one week.    Based on data from 1,599 women who completed the study, participants were 14 percent more likely to report treatment was moderate or excellent with Diclectin than with placebo, the new analysis found.    But this finding may not be reliable because the final study results aren’t available and 37 percent of participants in the placebo group dropped out before the study ended, researchers note in the current analysis.    In the new analysis, researchers also couldn’t see how physicians scored symptoms. And, data for 30 patients recruited in the original trial were excluded from analysis by regulators because there were data recorded without a record of patient visits, the new study notes.    Persaud wasn’t able to contact any of the original researchers, and many of them may have died.    Still, Persaud said women prescribed this drug should stop taking it and speak to their doctors about other options to treat morning sickness.    But not all doctors agree with this assessment.    “Studies that have been done since this trial was completed in the 1970s show that doxylamine and pyridoxine are an effective treatment for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy,” said Dr. Siripanth Nippita, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who wasn’t involved in the current analysis.    “Based on research involving over 200,000 women, we can say that doxylamine and pyridoxine are safe to take during pregnancy,” Nippita added by email. “They can be an important part of treatment for nausea and vomiting.”  "
2j5vK4Q,2017-01-04,Hospice care linked to higher family satisfaction," (Reuters Health) - Families of terminally ill cancer patients may be more satisfied with the end-of-life treatment their loved ones receive when it involves hospice care, a recent study suggests.    Researchers examined interview data from 1,970 family members of deceased cancer patients. The patients all had advanced lung or colorectal cancer, and roughly half had received hospice care.    Hospice was associated with better symptom relief, attainment of pain-management goals, and quality of end-of-life care, the study found. Families of patients who received at least 30 days of hospice care reported the highest quality of life outcomes.    Many people think of hospice as something that should be saved for the very end of life, said study co-author Dr. Alexi Wright of Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.     “However, our findings suggest that earlier hospice enrollment is associated with better symptom management, less pain, better quality of care, and a higher likelihood that patients will receive the care that they want in their own environment,” Wright added by email.    Patients with advanced cancer often experience pain, difficulty breathing and distress at the end of life and use intensive, hospital-based care during their final days, researchers note in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.    Hospice offers an alternative approach focused on comfort and often delivers care within a home environment that many families may prefer.    To see how hospice influences the way families perceive patients’ care, researchers compared interview responses from loved ones of hospice patients to responses from families members of similar patients who didn’t receive hospice care.    While families of hospice patients reported more pain than other families, the people in the hospice group were more likely to report that their loved one received just the right amount of pain medicine, the study found.    About 80 percent of families in the hospice group reported the amount of pain medicine was just right, compared with 73 percent of the families that didn’t use hospice services.    With hospice, 78 percent of families said the patient got the right amount of relief from breathing difficulties, compared with 70 percent for the non-hospice group.    In addition, 80 percent of hospice families said patients’ end of life wishes were followed, compared with 74 percent in the other group.    Patients received excellent end-of-life care according to 57 percent of the hospice families and just 42 percent of the other families.    The results for these patients with family caregivers might not apply to patients without family caregivers, the authors note. It’s also possible that patients with different types of cancer might have different experiences.    Even so, the results add to a growing body of evidence linking hospice to better quality of life for patients, a greater likelihood of dying in the location of choice, and less bereavement-related distress for caregivers, said Dr. Camilla Zimmermann, a palliative care researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the study.    Patients and families should know that enrollment in hospice for more than 30 days is associated with better quality of care at the end of life, Zimmermann said by email.    When people have little or no hospice care, it’s often at least in part because patients and families didn’t know about their end-of-life care options soon enough, said Dr. Preeti Malani of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.    “Candid discussions about end of life care with family and with the medical team caring for a patient need to happen sooner and in an ongoing manner,” Malani, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “There also needs to be greater recognition of palliative care (not hospice care) as complementary to curative therapies.”   Palliative treatments are used to relieve symptoms. Unlike hospice, palliative care doesn’t require patients to forego active cancer treatments or have six months or less to live, said Dio Kavalieratos of the University of Pittsburgh.     “Palliative care can be provided from the day of diagnosis, and can help ease a transition to hospice care if appropriate,” Kavalieratos, who wasn’t involved in the study, added by email.

2ianu3d,2017-01-04,Why you shouldn’t treat earwax without seeing a doctor," (Reuters Health) - It may be tempting to clean your ears with Q-tips or try ear candling to clear away any clogs, but it’s best to check with a professional before taking matters into your own hands, doctors advise.    “Patients may try to blindly instrument their ears with cotton ear buds, bobby pins, or other tools,” said Dr. Seth Schwartz, chair of a committee that drafted new guidelines for diagnosing and treating earwax for the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery.   “These are generally ineffective and potentially dangerous,” Schwartz, director of the Listen For Life Center at Virginia Mason in Seattle, said by email.    “Scratching of the ear canal skin can lead to pain and infection,” Schwartz added. “Sometimes they just push the wax in further, and there also is the potential for damage to the ear drum.”   The body makes earwax, or cerumen, to keep ears clean and trap substances like dust and dirt, preventing debris from getting further into the ear where it can cause damage. As new skin grows in the ear canal, it pushes old earwax from the inside of the ears closer to the opening where it naturally flakes off or washes away during bathing.    Often, there’s nothing wrong with having a little earwax near the opening, doctors stress in guidelines published in Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery.   But when the ear’s self-cleaning process doesn’t work well, too much earwax may accumulate and partially or fully block the ear canal. This can cause problems including pain, itching, discharge from the ear, ringing in the ear or hearing loss.    Roughly one in 10 children and one in 20 adults suffer from excessive earwax buildup, as do more than one third of elderly people, according to the guidelines.    Excessive cleaning can irritate the ear canal, cause infection, and even increase the chances of excessive buildup, or what’s known as cerumen impaction, the guidelines note.   There’s no evidence that using ear candles, a process that relies on heat to remove buildup, actually works at clearing impaction, and this can cause serious damage to the ear canal and eardrum, the guidelines also emphasize.    Patients should see a doctor if they experience hearing loss, pain or feel fullness in their ears or aren’t certain whether the amount of wax is normal.    People should also get a checkup if they have ear drainage or bleeding because these symptoms aren’t tied to impaction and may be an indication of other problems.    “The mantra from previous generations of ‘don’t stick anything in your ear that is smaller than your elbow’ still applies,” said Dr. Duane Taylor, chief executive officer and medical director of Le Visage ENT and Facial Plastic Surgery in Bethesda, Maryland.   “Generally people still erroneously believe that the cotton-tipped applicator or Q-tip is the primary weapon of choice to get rid of earwax,” Taylor, who wasn’t involved in the guidelines, said by email.    In most cases, though, wax that’s naturally found near the outer part of the ear can be wiped away with a damp cloth, Taylor added. Cotton-tipped applicators can compact the wax and push it deeper into the ear, making it harder to remove.    Certain hearing aids, or wearing earbuds instead of over-the-ear headphones, can also inadvertently push wax deeper into the ear, Taylor said.    At home, people may be able to use wax removal drops, baby oil or a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to prevent buildup, but it’s best to consult a doctor first.    “In most cases, primary care clinicians are the first line of evaluation for this condition and are adequately equipped to manage it,” Taylor said. “When it is noted to be more complicated or there is a risk of injury there should be a referral to an Ear, Nose and Throat physician for removal.”  "
2iEj0Tx,2017-01-04,"Even after noncardiac surgery, heart attacks and strokes may be a risk"," (Reuters Health) - A new study is shedding light on the risk of heart attack, stroke and death among patients who are hospitalized for surgery that doesn’t involve the heart.   These complications occur in 1 in 33 - or 3 percent - of hospitalizations for noncardiac surgery in the United States, researchers found.    “Given that more than 300 million noncardiac surgeries are performed worldwide each year, this is a situation that physicians encounter commonly,” said study author Sripal Bangalore of the New York University School of Medicine in New York City.   “Although the focus is on preventing death (during surgery), this study emphasizes the need to think about stroke outcomes,” Bangalore told Reuters Health. The risks are higher, he added, with surgery in the chest or on major blood vessels, or with organ transplants.   Bangalore and colleagues analyzed data from more than 10 million hospitalizations between 2004 and 2013, looking for heart attacks, strokes and death after surgeries that weren’t heart-related. They saw these complications in more than 317,000 cases, or about 3 percent.    The rates were highest during hospitalizations for vascular, thoracic and transplant surgeries, at 7.7 percent, 6.5 percent and 6.3 percent, respectively. Patients undergoing obstetric and gynecologic surgery had the lowest risk, the authors report in JAMA Cardiology.    Patients who had one of these complications were generally older, more likely to be male and more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity, tobacco use, alcohol abuse, hypertension, diabetes and kidney disease. In addition, non-Hispanic blacks had the highest rates of stroke and death following surgery.   The research team estimates that about 150,000 heart attacks and strokes occur each year in the U.S. following noncardiac surgery.    “Surgery is important, and there’s no doubt that it improves quality of life for those with cancer, joint issues and vascular problems,” said Dr. Philip Devereaux, head of cardiology at Juravinski Hospital and Cancer Center in Ontario, Canada. Devereaux, who researches cardiac complications and surgery, was not involved with this study.   “However, people often don’t appreciate the proportion who get serious complications,” he told Reuters Health. “Surgery provides the cocktail needed for heart complications.”   The researchers found that noncardiac surgery deaths and heart attacks declined between 2004 and 2013 (from 3.1 percent to 2.6 percent), but strokes increased slightly (from 0.52 percent to 0.77 percent).    Devereaux pointed out that in the past two decades, North American hospitals have been discharging patients sooner after surgery. This may partly explain why deaths have decreased in the data, he said.   “With this data, we’re unable to follow patients to a common point in time, such as 30 days after surgery,” he said. “That can make it difficult to monitor and estimate.”   Hospitals may also miss certain markers of heart destruction following surgery, Devereaux said. Since patients receive pain medicine during surgery, it can often mask heart attack symptoms.   “If we don’t specifically look for biomarkers 24-36 hours after surgery, we miss some heart attacks,” he said. “It’s highly probable that most centers in the U.S. aren’t measuring these biomarkers.”   That means 1 in 33 is probably an underestimate of how many heart attacks and strokes actually occur after noncardiac surgery, Devereaux added.    “This highlights a substantial problem that the public should know about,” Devereaux said. “The medical community needs to bring attention to this issue so patients can have worry-free surgery that doesn’t shorten their life or lead to major complications.”  "
2iPreIo,2017-01-04,Stores may steer teen boys to supplements doctors advise against," (Reuters Health) – - Employees at health food stores often recommend supplements like creatine and testosterone to teen boys even though these products pose serious health risks, a U.S. study suggests.   More than one in 10 teen boys try muscle-building products, as do more than one in five male high school athletes, researchers note in Pediatrics. Risks of creatine include liver and kidney damage, dehydration and muscle cramps; testosterone is also tied to liver and kidney impairment and may halt bone growth.    For the study, researchers posing as 15-year-old boys called 244 stores and asked what they should buy to bulk up. Overall, 67 percent of store employees recommended creatine and 10 percent suggested testosterone.   “Just because something is sold in a health food store does not make it good for kids,” said lead study author Dr. Ruth Milanaik, of Northwell Health and Cohen Children’s Medical Center of New Hyde Park, New York.   “Parents and teens must learn to read the warning labels placed on products in order to fully understand what they are putting into their bodies,” Milanaik added by email.    These supplements are legal, but manufacturers have placed age restriction warning labels on creatine and testosterone boosters advising against use by minors, Milanaik said.    While it’s clear some teens ignore the warnings on these supplements, which are widely available in health food stores nationwide, the current study offers fresh insight into how often store employees recommend the products to minors who shouldn’t use them.    To see what teen boys might experience shopping for supplements, a researcher called the stores and identified himself as a 15-year-old football player entering 10th grade.    First, the researcher said he was doing strength training and asked an open-ended question about what the store employee recommended he take to improve his performance. Without prompting, 39 percent of the employees recommended creatine, while only two workers told teens to take testosterone.    Next, the researcher asked specifically about whether the store employee would recommend creatine, and 29 percent did. Roughly 30 percent of the workers advised against creatine, while 2.5 percent of them refused to make recommendations over the phone.    When the researcher asked specifically about testosterone, 9 percent recommended it. But 89 percent of the workers advised against taking testosterone and 1.2 percent of them refused to discuss it over the phone.    Last, the researcher asked if he could purchase the supplements on his own if he came to the store.    For creatine, 74 percent of the workers said the researcher could come buy it himself, while 23 percent said he would have to be at least 18 years old to make the purchase.    With testosterone, 41 percent of the employees said the researcher could buy it, and 56 percent said he would need to be at least 18 years old.    When store workers said it wasn’t possible to buy the products, they said it was against store policy or that the products weren’t recommended for minors.    The findings suggest that pediatricians need to educate parents and teens about safe ways to improve athletic performance and the risks of supplements like creatine and testosterone, the authors conclude.    Ideally, doctors and parents should talk to children before they are old enough to go into the stores and buy supplements, said Dr. Michele LaBotz, a sports medicine researcher at InterMed P.A. in Portland, Maine, who wasn’t involved in the study.    Pointing out these items in the store, showing kids the labels and explaining the risks can help with this conversation, LaBotz said by email. Parents should also pay attention when kids search for information about these products online, and be aware of pressures teen athletes may face to bulk up or use performance-enhancing products.    “For the otherwise healthy individual, there are no frank health benefits (with) these substances,” LaBotz said. “Proactively talk with your kids about this stuff, and start these conversations well before the teen years.”  "
2iwlGVl,2017-01-03,Heavy drinking tied to higher risk of heart attacks," (Reuters Health) - Alcohol abuse may increase the risk of heart attacks and other cardiac problems even in people who don’t have a family history of heart disease or other known risk factors, a study suggests.    After accounting for established risk factors for heart disease such as smoking, obesity and diabetes, alcohol abuse was associated with a 40 percent higher risk of heart attack, the study found.   Excessive drinking was also tied to a two-fold greater risk of atrial fibrillation, or an irregular rapid heartbeat, and a 2.3-fold increased risk of congestive heart failure, a chronic pumping disorder.   Even though some previous research has linked an occasional or even daily drink to better heart health, these findings should put to rest any notion that drinking more is better for our health, said senior study author Dr. Gregory Marcus of the University of California, San Francisco.    “Excessive drinking might be ostensibly `justified’ by some individuals because of the purported heart benefits,” Marcus said by email.    “We have shown here that not only does excessive alcohol substantially increase the risk for atrial fibrillation and heart failure, but also heart attack, the one phenomenon that previous data has suggested might be mitigated by moderate alcohol consumption,” Marcus added.    To assess the connection between alcohol abuse and heart problems, Marcus and colleagues analyzed data on more than 14.7 million California adults who had surgery, emergency or inpatient hospital care from 2005 to 2009.    About 1.8 percent of the people in the study, or approximately 268,000 patients, had been diagnosed with alcohol abuse.    The increased risk of heart attack, atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure associated with alcohol abuse in the study were similar in magnitude to other well-recognized modifiable risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, researchers report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.    Completely eradicating alcohol abuse would result in more than 73,000 fewer atrial fibrillation cases, 34,000 fewer heart attacks, and 91,000 fewer patients with congestive heart failure in the U.S. alone, the researchers estimated.    The study is observational and doesn’t prove drinking causes heart problems.   Another limitation of the study is that the data on patients diagnosed with alcohol abuse problems didn’t specify how much individual people drank, the authors note. It’s also possible that some people in the study were excessive drinkers but not diagnosed as alcohol abusers in the data, which also limits the ability to specify the amount of alcohol that may be harmful.    Even so, it’s possible that the current study with its broad population of hospitalized patients may have identified alcohol-related heart problems that previous research missed by focusing on a narrower subset of people, Dr. Michael Criqui, of the University of California, San Diego, writes in an accompanying editorial.    Earlier studies may have found drinking protective against heart attack and other heart problems because they included patients with a stable, healthier lifestyle, Criqui writes. By contrast, the broad cross-section of adults in the current study included more sick people who might not be as health-conscious.    “The most recent evidence casts doubt on whether there are any heart benefits of light to moderate drinking,” Criqui said by email.    “No randomized clinical trials have been done, and they would be technically difficult to do on this question,” Criqui added. “Studies do show benefit to quitting drinking, and the sooner the better, as over time the damage may be irreversible.”  "
2hsSEVH,2017-01-03,"Tobacco, but not pot, boosts early stroke risk"," (Reuters Health) - Smoking pot in young adulthood does not seem to increase the risk of early stroke, but cigarette smoking does, according to a study of nearly 50,000 Swedish military conscripts.   “Extensive tobacco smokers in late adolescence had a fivefold increased risk of stroke before age 45, when compared to non-smokers, and more than double the risk of stroke (up through) age 60,” study author Dr. Anna-Karin Danielsson of Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm told Reuters Health via email.    More than 90 percent of stroke risk is related to tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and other modifiable risk factors, Danielsson and her team note in their report in Stroke. New evidence has suggested that marijuana may also increase stroke risk, they add, especially for strokes occurring before age 45.   To look for a link between cannabis and stroke, the researchers looked at data on 49,321 men born from 1949 to 951 who were drafted into military service at ages 18 to 20.   Over the next 60 years, there were 1,037 first time strokes, about half due to blood-vessel blockages and about a quarter due to bleeding. There were 192 first-time strokes among men under age 45.   Overall, after taking other risk factors into account, the researchers found that using pot more than 50 times was not associated with an increased risk of stroke at age 45 or younger. Pot users did have a two-fold higher risk of stroke due to blood-vessel blockage, but the link was weakened after the researchers accounted for participants’ tobacco use.    Men who smoked at least 20 cigarettes a day, however, were at five times the risk of stroke before age 45, and more than two times the risk by age 60.   “The almost doubled risk of ischemic stroke following heavy cannabis use that was observed in our study disappeared when we controlled for tobacco smoking,” Danielsson said.    But, she added, the fact that almost all the pot smokers were also tobacco smokers makes it hard “to rule out possible associations between cannabis and stroke.”   “Further studies examining the possible health effects of cannabis are needed,” she said. “For one thing, we need to be able to control for the effects of tobacco smoking.   Nine states have legalized recreational marijuana use, and 28 states have legalized it for medicinal purposes.   The National Institute on Drug Abuse says marijuana is tied to some negative health outcomes beyond the mental effects the drug is known for. Those outcomes include possible breathing problems, increased heart rates and possible long-term cognition problems among young users. ( bit.ly/2iAEGzZ )  "
2hTGLWK,2017-01-02,Teen drug use may not be tied to sports participation," (Reuters Health) - Playing team sports in high school may not influence whether or not teens use heroin or abuse prescription drugs, a U.S. study suggests.    Researchers examined data from more than 21,000 high school seniors surveyed between 2006 and 2014.    Overall, they didn’t find any differences in prescription or illegal opioid use between students who played at least one competitive sport and non-athletes. The study did, however, find an increased risk with three sports: hockey, weightlifting and wrestling.   “We already knew from several of my previous studies that while athletes in general are at a lower risk of opioid use, athletes involved in high contact sports like wrestling, football, ice hockey, and lacrosse are at a greater risk of misusing prescription opioids,” said lead study author Philip Veliz of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.    “The current study confirms that athletes in certain high contact sports are at a greater risk of misusing opioids,” Veliz added by email.    The study participants answered survey questions that touched on a variety of factors that can influence drug use, including grades, social life, employment, family characteristics, cigarette and alcohol use, and sports participation.    The most common sports played by teens in the study included basketball, football, baseball, soccer, track and weightlifting. About 31 percent of participants didn’t play any sports at all, while 30 percent played one sport, 18 percent competed in two sports and 21 percent participated in at least three different sports.    To assess opioid use, surveys also asked whether teens had tried heroin in the past year with or without a needle, or tried narcotics other than heroin such as opium or codeine without a doctor’s prescription.    About 8 percent of teens surveyed said they had taken prescription opioids in the past year without getting a prescription from a doctor.    Slightly less than 1 percent of teens said they had tried heroin in the past year, and an even smaller fraction of adolescents reported using both heroin and opioids that didn’t come from a doctor.   While most responses were similar for athletes and students who didn’t play sports, there were some exceptions, researchers report in the Journal of Adolescent Health.    With prescription opioids, tennis players were 25 percent less likely than non-athletes to use these medicines without a prescription, the study found. But weightlifters were 22 percent more likely to take opioids without a prescription and wrestlers were 33 percent more likely.    Heroin use, meanwhile, was three times more common among ice hockey players than non-athletes and 81 percent more likely among weightlifters.    Compared with teens who didn’t participate in sports, hockey players were nearly four times more likely to use both heroin and prescription painkillers, while weightlifters were nearly twice as likely to use both types of opioids.    The study is observational, and doesn’t prove whether or not sports participation in general or certain athletic pursuits in particular influence the odds of teen drug use, the authors note. Researchers also lacked data on sports injuries, which might influence whether teens tried painkillers with or without a prescription.    “High contact sports, particularly for males, have some of the highest injury rates at the interscholastic level excluding weightlifting,” Veliz said.     “Injuries are bound to happen, and these athletes may be self-medicating to recover from injuries in order to get back on the playing field as soon as possible,” Veliz added. “Accordingly, these athletes may develop a dependence on opioids that can eventually lead to heroin use.”   Among other things, parents can help prevent misuse of opioids by making sure teen athletes get close supervision after injuries that require painkiller prescriptions and disposing of any unused medications, Veliz said.

2iXJ2QR,2017-01-02,Life-extending capacity of new cancer drugs varies widely," (Reuters Health) - Drugs recently approved around the world to fight cancer increased patients’ overall survival, but benefits vary depending on the drug, a new study shows.   Researchers looked at the 62 cancer drugs approved in the U.S. and Europe between 2003 and 2013 and found they extended survival by an average of about 3.5 months.   But nearly a third of the drugs lacked evidence to suggest they increased survival when compared to alternative treatments.   “Our results point to the notion that new cancer treatments may not always provide patients with greater clinical benefits, or lower risks, over existing treatments,” wrote senior researcher Dr. Elias Mossialos, of the London School of Economics and Political Science, in an email to Reuters Health.   The risk-benefit ratio of new drugs is especially important if people are concerned, for example, about whether the cost of a drug would make it difficult for a person to complete the treatment regimen.   Writing in JAMA Oncology, Mossialos and colleagues point to growing questions about the value of new cancer medicines. While the drugs’ high costs may be a barrier to access, they note, some people argue the high prices are justified if the treatments offer large benefits.   A lack of solid data on new drugs’ benefits and risks makes it difficult to evaluating their value.    For the 62 medicines they wanted to study, the researchers found data from England, France and Australia evaluating 53 drugs. Nearly 80 percent were tied to improvements in survival, quality of life or safety.   The drugs increased survival - with or without recurrence - by about 3.5 months on average, compared to other treatments available in 2003.   Twenty-three drugs were individually tied to an increase in survival of three months or more. Six drugs extended survival by less than three months. Eight drugs increased survival by an unknown amount. And for 16 of the approved drugs, there was no evidence to suggest they were better than alternative treatments at extending survival.   The researchers point out in an email that overall survival benefits differed by the type of drug. For example, drugs for thyroid cancer were tied to no increase in overall survival, while drugs to treat breast cancer were linked to an average increase of about 8.5 months.   Twenty-two of the drugs were tied to an improved quality of life, but 24 were linked to worse patient safety, which include side effects and whether a person could tolerate the treatment.   The researchers write in their email that they extending the study to look at newer drugs. They are also working to link their evidence with the cost of individual medicines.   Mossialos said the study should remind people of the importance of the relationship between doctors and patients. He said, “Patients should work with their physicians to consider all available evidence that exists in support of individual treatments, and use this alongside any inputs from their clinician to identify the treatment that would best correspond with their own medical and personal circumstances.”  "
2ht1H5Q,2017-01-02,Cured meats linked to worsening asthma symptoms," (Reuters Health) – Eating large amounts of cured meats was linked to worse symptoms among asthma sufferers, a French study found.                    Bacon is fried up in a pan in a kitchen in this photo illustration shot October 26, 2015. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/Illustration      That was true even after taking obesity into account, the authors say.   So-called cured meats have been preserved and flavored by the addition of various combinations of salt, nitrates, nitrites, and sugar. Examples of such processed meats include bacon, ham, prosciutto, corned beef, pastrami, and pepperoni.   “Cured meat intake, a typical food in industrialized societies, has been associated with many chronic diseases, including lung cancer and COPD, but its association with asthma remained unclear,” study leader Dr. Zhen Li told Reuters Health in an email. Li is a researcher at Inserm and Paul Brousse Hospital in Villejuif.   As reported in Thorax, the research team had data on 971 adults from five French cities who answered questions about diet, weight, and asthma symptoms between 2003 and 2007.   On average, participants ate 2.5 servings of cured meats per week.    Just over 40 percent of the participants said they had had asthma at some point, and around half said they had never smoked. Each participant was assigned an asthma symptom score, ranging from zero to five, based on difficulty breathing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath during the previous year.    Follow-up surveys completed between 2011 and 2013 showed that about half of the participants had no changes in their asthma scores, over one-fourth said their symptoms had improved and about 20 percent felt their symptoms had gotten worse.   After accounting for other factors such as smoking, physical activity, age, other dietary habits, and education, researchers found that participants who ate the most cured meat (four or more servings per week) were 76 percent more likely to see a worsening of symptoms compared to those who ate the least (less than one full serving per week).     About 35 percent of the participants were overweight and about 10 percent were obese, based on their responses. Those conditions probably explained about 14 percent of the association, the authors estimated.   “Our finding, together with other previous findings, suggests that patients with asthma might have benefits by following a multiple-interventional program,” Li said. “That means, besides the medication, weight control as well as dietary intervention such as reducing cured meat intake might also help them to control their asthma symptoms.”   Dr. Sunit Jariwala complimented the study but noted that its observational design means it can’t prove cause-and-effect.   “Cured meats are rich in nitrites which may lead to any kind of oxidative stress related lung damage and asthma,” said Jariwala, who is director of allergy and immunology research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center in New York City.    Jariwala, who was not involved in the study, believes obesity is an important consideration with asthma patients.   “In this study, as well as previous studies, obesity may be linked to systemic inflammation that can worsen asthma as well as other obesity related conditions such a sleep apnea,” he said.   Jariwala advises patients to follow a balanced diet that includes fresh, unprocessed foods and is low in salt, sugar, and saturated fats.  "
2liopCy,2017-12-29,Cigarette smoking during pregnancy linked to ADHD risk in offspring," (Reuters Health) - Children born to women who smoke cigarettes during pregnancy, especially when mothers are heavy smokers, are at an increased risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a new review of medical studies confirms.   Mothers who smoked during pregnancy had an overall 60 percent higher risk of having a child with ADHD compared to women who didn’t smoke. For mothers who smoked fewer than 10 cigarettes per day, the risk of having a child who developed ADHD was 54 percent higher than for nonsmoking mothers. For mothers who were heavier smokers, the risk was 75 percent higher than for nonsmokers.    An increased risk of ADHD for children of women who smoke while pregnant has been reported before. What’s new here, the authors say, is that the data have been pooled from studies in multiple countries and time periods, and also that as the daily tally of cigarettes went up, the risk of ADHD went up.   The findings “lend greater strength and credibility and statistical power to previous studies that likewise show that pregnant women who smoke have a greater likelihood of having a child with ADHD,” said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief, developmental and behavioral pediatrics, Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children’s Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park.   Adesman, who was not involved in the research, told Reuters Health by phone that the study “has to be taken seriously. Women who smoke during pregnancy have one more reason to stop.”    According to 2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System (PRAMS) data from 24 states, approximately 10 percent of American women reported smoking during the last three months of pregnancy.    Eleven percent of U.S. children ages 4 to 17, or 6.4 million children, have been diagnosed with ADHD based on parent reports, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ADHD can affect attention, hyperactivity and self-control, causing difficulty in school and socially.   As reported in Pediatrics, Dr. Dezhi Mu and colleagues at West China Second University Hospital in Chengdu, Sichuan, China, analyzed 20 studies published between 1998 and 2017 that looked at the potential role of smoking during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD in offspring. Altogether, the studies involved nearly 3 million people in Europe, Brazil, Japan, Australia and the U.S.   The team found lower risks for ADHD in children of mothers who smoked in the U.S. and Europe, where more smokers stop smoking when they get pregnant.    “It would be a big leap from that, but if you are a prior smoker and stop during pregnancy, the inference is that the risk of ADHD goes down,” Dr. Jeffrey Newcorn, director, The Center of Excellence in ADHD and Related Disorders, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai told Reuters Health in a phone interview.    Data from seven studies showed that while mothers’ smoking had a greater effect than fathers’ smoking on ADHD risk, there was still a 20 percent higher risk of ADHD in children born to fathers who smoked.    The new analysis can’t prove that smoking causes ADHD. Among other limitations of the new research are that different criteria were used to diagnose ADHD in the various studies, and tobacco use during pregnancy was self-reported by the mothers.    Newcorn, who was not involved in the research, would like to see more studies on the relationship between genetic and environmental factors in developing ADHD, as well as the role of nicotine exposure.

2llD5jx,2017-12-28,Can a sun salutation a day keep night sweats at bay?," (Reuters Health) - Menopausal women who practice yoga may experience more relief from symptoms like night sweats and hot flashes than their peers who don’t do this type of exercise, a review of existing research suggests.     The study team examined data on 1,306 women in 13 different clinical trials that randomly assigned some participants to practice yoga and others to get no treatment or to try a different type of intervention such as health education or other forms of exercise. All of the women suffered from menopause symptoms at the beginning of the trials.    Yoga was better than no treatment at reducing total menopause symptoms, anxiety related to symptoms, hot flashes and night sweats, and vaginal dryness and pain during sex, the study found.    “There were already clear hints from earlier studies that yoga might be good for relieving menopause-related psychological symptoms such as mood swings, depression or sleep problems,” said lead study author Holger Cramer, research director of the department of internal and integrative medicine at Kliniken Essen-Mitte and the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany.    “Based on the new data, yoga can also effectively relieve physical symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, fatigue or bladder problems,” Cramer said by email. “This indicates a potentially beneficial effect of yoga for all women with menopausal symptoms.”   Women go through menopause when they stop menstruating, which typically happens between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from vaginal dryness to mood swings, joint pain and insomnia.   In the current study, yoga was better than other types of exercise for so-called vasomotor symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats.    Yoga was also better for overall menopause symptoms than health education.    The analysis included four clinical trials from the U.S., three from India, two each from Brazil and China, and one each from Germany and South Korea.    Half of these studies included at least 54 participants, although they ranged in size from 30 to 355 women.    The small trials ranged in length from 4 to 16 weeks and had women practice yoga or do other interventions anywhere from 1 to 14 times weekly.    Women who did yoga in the trials tried a variety of different forms, including hatha yoga that focuses on breathing and meditation and Iyengar yoga, which concentrates on body alignment.    One limitation of the study is that the variety of approaches to yoga used in different trials made it difficult to determine what type of practice might help most with menopause symptoms, the authors note in Maturitas.    Even so, the results offer fresh evidence of the potential for yoga to help with menopause symptoms, said Dr. James Stahl of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and Geisel School of Medicine Lebanon, New Hampshire.    “All of the mind-body tools, yoga, acupuncture, qi gong, and meditation probably work through multiple mechanisms - through remodeling how the mind-body perceives sensations and signals, how the mind-body responds to those stimuli and finally through helping set or reset the mind-body’s steady state,” Stahl, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Because yoga is a relatively low-risk physical activity that can be easily adapted to different fitness levels, patients should consider it for symptom relief, said Dr. Rachael Polis, a researcher at Crozer-Keystone Health System headquartered in Springfield, Pennsylvania.    “Yoga is relatively low-impact, inexpensive, can be practiced anywhere, and during any time of day,” Polis, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   “For this reason, it’s a great early intervention for patients to attempt,” Polis added. “I do recommend someone new to yoga take classes with a well-trained instructor who can teach correct body alignment and suggest posture modifications when needed.”  "
2vXnxdU,2017-12-28,‘Artificial pancreas’ works during intense exercise," (Reuters Health) - An “artificial pancreas” that monitors blood sugar and automatically delivers insulin may make it safer for teens with type 1 diabetes to participate in sports, a U.S. study suggests.    Researchers focused on a group of 32 teens with type 1 diabetes who participated in a five-day skiing camp, spending about five hours a day on the slopes. Half of the athletes used an artificial pancreas, also known as a closed-loop insulin delivery system; the rest wore their regular insulin pumps and administered insulin themselves using a so-called open loop system.    With the artificial pancreas, participants had blood sugar levels in a healthy range about 71 percent of the time, compared with 65 percent of the time among teens using the open-loop system, researchers report in Diabetes Care.    Dangerously low blood sugar, a common problem when people with type 1 diabetes participate in sports, also happened less often with the artificial pancreas.    “All type 1 diabetes patients using an insulin pump should very seriously consider using an artificial pancreas, regardless of how active they are,” said lead study author Marc Breton of the Center for Diabetes Technology at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.    “The artificial pancreas will work (and well) even if you exercise a lot, and you will benefit from its automation even if you already know how to control your blood glucose during and after exercise,” Breton said by email. “Eventually, this system may allow people with diabetes the freedom to participate safely in physical activities that they likely avoided in the past.”   In type 1 diabetes, a chronic condition typically diagnosed in children and young adults, the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone needed to allow blood sugar, or glucose, to enter cells and produce energy. Poorly controlled, diabetes can lead to cardiovascular disease, kidney complications and death.   People with type 1 diabetes typically have to test their own blood sugar levels throughout the day and inject insulin to manage it. Nights are often a problem because dangerous blood sugar changes can happen while the person is sleeping, and intense exercise can also result in unsafe dips or spikes in blood sugar levels.   Current artificial pancreas systems can monitor blood sugar every few minutes and use that information to adjust insulin delivery. This may be less cumbersome for athletes than open-loop systems, which require them to manually adjust the amount of insulin delivered by their pump based on readouts from a separate glucose monitor.   In the study, athletes had dangerously low blood sugar 1.8 percent of the time with the artificial pancreas, compared with 3.2 percent of the time with the open-loop system.    Dangerously high blood sugar also happened less often with the artificial pancreas: 7 percent of the time compared with 9.3 percent of the time with the open-loop system.    Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the focus on athletes without a history of dangerously low blood sugar, which may limit how much the findings apply to all people with type 1 diabetes, the authors note. In the study, teens also had intense supervision by doctors that might not occur in real life.   The type, intensity and duration of physical activity all matter, said Ali Cinar, director of the Engineering Center for Diabetes Research and Education at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.    “People trying a new type of exercise or routine should be careful in tracking their metabolic variations and adjusting their hypoglycemia prevention routines,” Cinar, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “A well-designed artificial pancreas can make these adjustments automatically.”   While the findings suggest an artificial pancreas may make it easier for athletes to manage type 1 diabetes, more research is needed to see if a device can be designed to respond to a wide variety of exercise experiences, said Michael Riddell of the Muscle Health Research Centre at York University in Toronto.   “At present, it is extremely difficult to mimic the normal physiologic response that a healthy pancreas has to exercise,” Riddell, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   "
2pGopkv,2017-12-27,"MRI scan safe for most people with older pacemakers, defibrillators"," (Reuters Health) - There’s good news for people with pacemakers and the doctors who treat them.   A new study reinforces earlier work suggesting that MRI scans are safe for patients with older devices, even if the MRI is focusing on the chest area.   Until now, the sensitive electronics of older pacemakers and implantable defibrillators were thought to be vulnerable to disruption when subjected to the magnetic fields and radio waves that allow magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, to see into the body.    The new study in The New England Journal of Medicine “confirms that pretty much anybody who has a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator can, with very few restrictions, safely get an MRI scan if they need it,” as long as the devices are properly adjusted before the scan and safeguards are in place, coauthor Dr. Henry Halperin, professor of medicine, radiology and biomedical engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.   To prevent problems, the researchers reprogrammed the devices to adopt a standard heart rhythm for people whose hearts won’t beat on their own and disabled functions that might cause the pacemaker to fire improperly if the MRI produced erratic signals in the heart. After the MRI, the devices were returned to their original settings.   Only newer devices designated as “MRI-conditional” have been considered safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The vast majority in use - about 6 million worldwide - do not have that designation. A 2005 analysis estimated that at least half of those patients will someday need an MRI.   The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers the Medicare insurance program for the elderly and disabled, will only pay for MRI scans in patients with “MRI-conditional” devices, coauthor Dr. Saman Nazarian, of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, told Reuters Health in an email.   Given the results of the new study and an earlier one published in February, which also showed the older devices to be safe, “it’s hard to understand the position” of the CMS, said Nazarian, a cardiac electrophysiologist.   In that February study, a separate team of researchers reported in The New England Journal that no serious problems were seen in 1,318 patients with a pacemaker or implantable defibrillator who received an MRI. But in those cases, the chest area wasn’t scanned by the MRI.   In the new tests by the Nazarian-Halperin team, about 200 of the 1,509 pacemaker and defibrillator patients had their chest scanned with a 1.5 Tesla MRI. Neither the chest scans nor the scans done elsewhere in the body produced significant problems, said Dr. Halperin.    Nine of the devices were disrupted but reset themselves to a backup mode. In all but one case, the effect was temporary. There was one instance where the device had to be replaced, but it had a low battery and could not be properly reprogrammed.   Thus, a nearly-dead battery is probably one of the few reasons not to have an MRI, Dr. Halperin said. “Pacemakers do funny things when the battery is low.”   In five instances, doctors halted the MRI exam. In one case, the heart rate fell to under 40 beats per minute. In another, the patient’s heartbeat became too rapid. In the remaining three, the doctors decided that an MRI probably wouldn’t produce a useful image anyway.   Dr. Halperin said pacemakers and defibrillators cleared by the FDA since the 2000s are much better protected from the magnetic and radio waves of an MRI. “And we program them to avoid most any problems that might happen.”   Dr. Nazarian said he would advise patients that even if they have a device that’s not specifically rated for MRI safety, “Many centers across the U.S. are capable of performing safe imaging despite your device.”  "
2zDvHVF,2017-12-27,Spine surgery may be safer at hospitals than outpatient facilities," (Reuters Health) - Patients who get spinal surgery at outpatient centers may be more likely to have serious complications or require repeat operations than their counterparts who get these procedures in a hospital, a U.S. study suggests.    Researchers focused on an operation known as anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), which involves removing a damaged disc in the neck to reduce pressure on the spinal cord or nerve root that can cause pain, numbness and weakness. Most of these surgeries are done in hospitals with a one or two night stay, but a growing number of people are going instead to outpatient centers that may have lower costs in part because they don’t keep patients overnight.    The study looked at outcomes for 1,215 patients who had outpatient ACDF and 10,964 people who had these operations in a hospital between 2011 and 2016.    Overall, there were few complications, researchers report in The Spine Journal.    One year after surgery, 5.5 percent of the people who had outpatient surgery needed repeat operations, as did 4.1 percent in the inpatient group.    After accounting for individual patient characteristics like age, gender and other health problems, the researchers found that people who had outpatient ACDF were 79 percent more likely to require repeat operations within one year than patients who had operations in a hospital.    Outpatients were also 25 percent more likely to experience postoperative kidney failure.    “We were surprised that the outpatient cohort had greater rates of postoperative renal failure since these patients are typically younger and healthier to undergo surgery in the outpatient setting,” said senior study author Dr. Don Young Park of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.    “Our study is the first to show that outpatient ACDF is associated with some increased risk, even in ideal surgical candidates,” Park said by email.    All of the patients in the study had insurance through Humana.    In both the inpatient and outpatient groups, half of the patients were at least 65 to 69 years old.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how the location of surgery might influence the outcomes.    Another limitation of the study is that it relied on insurance claims data and lacked detailed medical information on individual patients, the authors note. Researchers also didn’t have data on early complications such as emergency room visits or hospitalizations.    Individual patient factors missing from the insurance claims data might explain the slight differences in outcomes between inpatient and outpatient operations, said Dr. Matthew McGirt of Carolina Neurosurgery & Spine Associates in Charlotte, North Carolina, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “There was no way to show the patient groups were similar with regards to risk factors for failed fusion,” McGirt said by email.    One factor that might have made a difference is smoking status, noted Dr. John Ratliff, a researcher at Stanford University Medical Center in California who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Smoking cessation is important in preventing post-operative complications,” Ratliff said by email. “Unfortunately, this study does not assess smoking status.”   Still, the findings add to the evidence that these operations can be done safely, but should be considered only after other treatments such as physical therapy, pain medication or steroid injections fail, doctors say.    “Surgery should be reserved for patients with severe pain despite an appropriate course of non-operative treatment or for those with neurologic deficits,” said Dr. Frank Phillips, a researcher at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study.    “In appropriately selected patients, the success rate for ACDF procedure in terms of improving symptoms is generally above 90 percent,” Phillips said by email.   Part of that selection process should involve considering which patients have the lowest complication risk and may be the most appropriate candidates for outpatient operations, said Dr. Daniel Refai, a researcher at Emory University in Atlanta who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Insurance companies and physician-owned ambulatory centers are driving patients to more outpatient surgeries,” Refai said by email. “But without proper selection, patients may be at increased risk with poorer outcomes.”  "
2DVrdwP,2017-12-26,Leaving the house linked to longevity in older adults," (Reuters Health) - For older people, getting out of the house regularly may contribute to a longer life - and the effect is independent of medical problems or mobility issues, according to new research from Israel.   For study participants in their 70s, 80s and 90s, the frequency with which they left the house predicted how likely they were to make it to the next age milestone, researchers report in Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.   “The simple act of getting out of the house every day propels people into engagement with the world,” said lead author Dr. Jeremy Jacobs of Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem in a phone interview.    “We saw similar benefits that you’d expect from treating blood pressure or cholesterol with medicine,” Jacobs said. “Social factors are important in the process of aging.”   Jacobs and colleagues analyzed data on 3,375 adults at ages 70, 78, 85 and 90 who were participating in the Jerusalem Longitudinal Study.    Based on their responses to questions about how often they left the house, participants were grouped into three categories: frequently (six or seven days per week), often (two to five times per week) or rarely (once a week or less).    People who left the house frequently at any of the ages examined were significantly more likely to live to the next age group. For example, among people who left the house frequently, often or rarely at age 78, 71 percent, 67 percent and 43 percent, respectively, survived to age 85. Among people who left the house frequently, often or rarely at age 90, 64 percent, 56 percent and 38 percent, respectively, made it to 95.   At all ages, people who left home less frequently tended to be male, less educated and to have higher rates of loneliness, financial difficulties, poor health, fatigue, poor sleep, less physical activity, bladder and bowel problems, history of falling in the last year, fear of falling, visual and hearing impairments, chronic pain and frailty.    The link between leaving the house and longevity, however, remained after the researchers accounted for medical or mobility issues such as chronic pain, vision or hearing impairment, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and kidney disease.   “We included people who had mobility difficulties, so this isn’t just about people moving their legs up and down,” Jacobs said. “That’s quite exciting. There’s something about interacting with the world outside that helps.”   The study did not examine the effect on participants of leaving the house, such as their sense of wellbeing or purpose. It also didn’t look at environmental factors that might foster or prevent going out, the authors note.   Future studies will look at the oldest cohort (age 95) as they reach 98 to 100 in coming years, Jacobs said. He and his colleagues are also interested in the role that optimism, social engagement and environmental aspects such as community sidewalks play in longer life.   “Studies show that if you create walkways that are friendly for walking, people start walking,” he said. “In neighborhoods with older adults, walkways with benches could encourage them to get out of the house and be social.”   Researchers are interested in finding ways to encourage adults to leave their home more and to develop systems that help them do that, said Dawn Mackey of Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It may be helpful for older adults and their caregivers to make plans to go out of the house more often,” she told Reuters Health by email. “And try to build up to going out of the house every day.”   They could plan these outings with these questions: When will it work best for me to leave the house? Where do I want to go? Is there someone to go out with or to meet when I am out? What are my options if the weather is bad or if I’m not feeling well one day?   “The wellbeing of our older adults is of paramount importance for public health and economic viability,” she said. “Going out of the house is an important way to maintain mobility and social engagement and ward off loneliness.”  "
2Dp9H3R,2017-12-25,Young gardeners eat more greens in first year at college," (Reuters Health) - First-year college students who have gardening experience eat more fruits and vegetables while they’re away at school compared with peers who don’t have green thumbs, U.S. researchers say.    The more gardening experience the college freshmen had, the greater their intake of produce, the study also found. Those who had gardened both during childhood and more recently ate 20 percent more servings of fruits and vegetables than classmates who had never gardened.   “The first year of college represents a major shift in independence for many young adults,” said senior study author Anne Mathews of the University of Florida in Gainesville.    “Most are moving from a home where food is provided and a daily schedule is pretty well set . . . to a life where they are now in charge of every single decision about food throughout the day,” she told Reuters Health by email.   Mathews and colleagues analyzed data from more than 1,100 college freshmen at eight U.S. universities. The students answered questionnaires about their fruit and vegetable intake and also about their gardening experience, including even small plants in pots, such as herbs, that can be grown on a windowsill.   The researchers found that 11 percent of students had gardened only during childhood, 19 percent had gardened only more recently, 20 percent gardened both during childhood and recently and 49 percent had never gardened.    On average, students who gardened as children and in the 12 months prior to the study ate about 2.5 cups of fruits and vegetables per day versus 1.9 cups for those who had never gardened.    In addition, recent gardeners who reported gardening weekly ate close to 3 cups of greens, while those who gardened monthly averaged 2.4 cups.   Mathews noted that having childhood experience with gardening isn’t enough. Students needed to carry the practice into their college years to continue good habits.   “We know that overall diet quality worsens when students begin college and that includes eating fewer fruits and vegetables,” Mathews said. “We also know that behaviors set during this phase of life tend to carry into adulthood.”    While recruiting participants, the study team screened more than 5,000 students and found that 85 percent of this group didn’t eat the recommended two fruit and three vegetable servings per day. This indicates that a large majority of high school seniors probably are not meeting the recommendation either, the authors note in Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.   “The first year of college is a very unique time in a person’s life,” said Mateja Savoie Roskos, a community nutrition researcher at Utah State University in Logan, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Many first-year college students experience weight gain often stemming from sedentary lifestyles and poor dietary patterns,” she told Reuters Health by email.    Future studies should look at additional factors that influence fruit and vegetable habits, she said.    At the eight universities in this study, several include ways for students to get involved with gardening experience on campus, Savoie Roskos noted. For example, the University of Florida has a Field and Fork Garden and Food Pantry, where students can volunteer to grow food, and some of the food is donated to the campus food pantry.    She said she’d also like to know how gardening experience can change from childhood through college.   “Getting children involved with gardening at an early age is vital to influencing food choices early in life,” she said. “Children enjoy being part of the process from planting, weeding and watering to harvesting and cooking.”  "
2AIHcR2,2017-12-25,"Parental-notification law appears to limit, delay abortions"," (Reuters Health) - Minors had nearly one-third fewer abortions in an Illinois clinic in the year after the state enacted a parental-notification law, according to new research questioning the legislation’s utility.   Proponents claim parental-notification laws lead to increased family communication and parental support, but the study suggests that the law failed on that score and might have erected barriers to care.    Minors traveling from out of state to have abortions in Illinois were more likely to have second-trimester than first-trimester abortions after the law took effect, the Journal of Adolescent Health report found.   “These laws are not improving the circumstances in which minors make decisions around abortion, and they may be putting the health and well-being of minors at risk by delaying access to care,” said lead author Lauren Ralph, an epidemiologist at Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health, a research group at the University of California, San Francisco.   “If you are preventing minors from obtaining the care they want, that should be concerning,” she said in a phone interview.   Dr. Maria I. Rodriguez, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland who was not involved with the study, said it “demonstrates the harms associated with a very common policy, which 38 states have implemented, ostensibly to protect women.”   Two-thirds of the states with parental-involvement laws require parental consent, although Illinois requires only notification, Ralph said.   When Illinois implemented the law in August 2013, girls under the age of 18 had to travel as far as New York or New Mexico to find a clinic where they could have an abortion without first notifying a parent.    Ralph and her team analyzed records from one private abortion clinic in southern Illinois to examine the impact of the parental-notification requirement on minor girls.     In the year following enactment, the clinic performed 29 percent fewer abortions on girls under the age of 18 but only 2 percent fewer abortions on young women from 18 to 20 years old, the study found.    Before the law, 71 percent of parents knew about their children’s pregnancies, while after the law’s implementation, 93 percent knew about the pregnancies. At the same time, parental supportiveness (as reported by the minors) remained the same, as did minors’ confidence in the certainty of their decision.    Minors from neighboring states with stricter abortion laws continued to travel to Illinois for abortion care following enactment of the parental-notification law, the study found. But, after the legislation was enacted, minors from outside the state were more likely to have later abortions.   Underage girls who traveled to Illinois from other states to have abortions were 47 percent more likely to have the procedure in their second trimester than in their first trimester, the study found.    Abortions are safest when performed earlier, Rodriguez said in an email.   “We are currently seeing a flood of different types of legislation that enact barriers to safe abortion care,” she said. “The study shows that increasing parental awareness does not improve the support adolescents receive, and it is associated with a delay in care, putting them at risk for adverse health outcomes.”    Rodriguez believes that restricting access to abortion increases poor health outcomes for women. “As an Ob-gyn,” she said, “this makes me worried for the health and wellbeing of American women.”  "
2A4oiU8,2017-12-25,Peers may influence how well type 1 diabetes is managed," (Reuters Health) - How young people with type 1 diabetes relate to their peers may have important effects on how well they manage the disease and how distressing it is for them, a small study suggests.   Peers can help teens and young adults accept their disease and follow their treatment plans, but youth who are too attuned to what their friends think of them may neglect disease management to fit in, the authors report in Diabetes Care.   “This was one of the first studies to ask adolescents and emerging adults with type 1 diabetes about their relations with peers at a certain point in time and one year later,” lead author Koen Raymaekers from the University of Leuven in Belgium told Reuters Health by email.   “We found that more general positive relations with peers at one point in time predicted less diabetes-specific distress one year later,” he said.   But, because young adults who were very oriented toward peers at the start had worse blood sugar control a year later, paying additional attention to peer relations during this time seems important, Raymaekers added.   The researchers recruited more than 400 Dutch-speaking young people in Belgium, aged 14 to 25, with type 1 diabetes. The participants answered questionnaires rating how they felt about the support they got from their peers as well as their perceptions of their parents’ responsiveness to their needs.    The study team also measured “peer orientation” - whether participants were more likely to listen to their parents or to their peers - with questions such as, “Would you ignore your diabetes management needs in order to make someone like you?”   The researchers had access to long-term blood sugar measurements and the young people answered questions about their treatment adherence as well as their diabetes-related distress levels.   The study team found that having supportive peers was associated with less diabetes-related distress over time. But, having extreme peer orientation was associated with greater treatment distress over time and poorer blood sugar control.   Conversely, good treatment adherence was tied to lower peer-orientation scores, less treatment distress and better blood sugar control.    Youth who reported having more responsive parents tended to have less food distress over time, the researchers also found.   “Our study indicates that as a parent/grandparent/caregiver it may be informative to ask about patients’ peer relations,” Raymaekers said.   If patients indicate that they experience difficulties with peer relations this may have an impact on their diabetes-related distress and perhaps even on treatment adherence and blood sugar control in the long term, he said.   “In addition, some patients may experience their diabetes as a burden when interacting with peers, and therefore neglect treatment in favor of fitting in with peers,” Raymaekers noted.   Therefore, he said, when there are indications of problematic relations with peers, as a parent/grandparent/caregiver one could think and talk with the patient on how to improve these relations without sacrificing treatment or feeling distressed by their diabetes.   Raymaekers added that he was not surprised to see that peers are important for patients with type 1 diabetes, but there were some specific “rather striking” findings, for example, that the 18-24 year olds who were very oriented toward peers at baseline had worse blood sugar control one year later.   There is a need for more research on this topic, which could uncover the cause and effect relationships between peer relationships and diabetes outcomes and the mechanisms at work, he said.   "
2B7EeBP,2017-12-25,Accurate celiac diagnosis in trial of new blood test," (Reuters Health) - An experimental blood test accurately identifies people who do, or don’t, have celiac disease, even if they are following gluten-free diets, researchers say.                    A blackboard is seen at Fonuts bakery, which offers unfried, gluten-free and vegan donuts in Los Angeles, California September 19, 2011. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson      Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects roughly one percent of people in the U.S. Those with the disease must avoid foods that contain the gluten protein from wheat, barley or rye. But far more than one percent of the population is following a gluten-free diet, which makes it harder to diagnose real cases of celiac disease.   The two main blood tests used to screen for celiac disease rely on detecting an immune response to gluten, but that immune response gradually disappears in people who avoid gluten.    “Unfortunately, many persons with gluten sensitivity go gluten-free without consulting their clinician for exclusion of celiac disease,” said lead study author Dr. Vikas K. Sarna’s from Oslo University Hospital in Norway. “In such cases, guidelines recommend . . .  performing a gluten challenge involving daily consumption of gluten for up to 8 weeks, followed by an endoscopic procedure for a biopsy taken from the small intestine (duodenum). Our blood test may replace such a gluten challenge and duodenal biopsy.”    The new test is designed to detect immune cells in a blood sample that are specifically targeted at gluten proteins, even when the individual hasn’t been recently exposed to gluten.   Sarna’s team tried their test on 62 patients with celiac disease and 19 individuals without celiac disease who were on a gluten-free diet, 10 patients with celiac disease who were eating foods containing gluten and 52 healthy individuals following normal diets. They also used the currently available celiac tests on these participants for comparison.   The old tests detected celiac disease in 9 out of 10 patients who weren’t on a gluten-free diet. But the old tests identified celiac disease in only 4 of the 62 patients who’d been following a gluten-free diet.   The new test, by comparison, was 96 percent accurate in distinguishing celiac disease patients from people who didn’t have celiac disease but were still following gluten-free diets.    It was 95 percent accurate for distinguishing celiac disease patients who were eating gluten-containing foods from healthy individuals following normal diets, the researchers report in Gastroenterology.   “We calculated that our test is stronger to exclude rather than confirm the diagnosis of celiac disease in gluten sensitive persons,” Sarna said. “Although we need more research in this field, we propose that the test be used to exclude celiac disease in persons on a gluten-free diet,” he told Reuters Health by email.    “It is important to point out that this test is still not available for commercial use, although there is a huge demand of a test for celiac disease that can be applied for persons that are already on a gluten-free diet,” Sarna said. “I do hope that the promising results from our study can initiate commercial initiatives along with more research, to allow this test to be used in the general public in the near future.”    Several members of the research team have applied for a patent on this testing technology, and some disclose that they are consultants for companies. The clinical trial in the current study was paid for by the Research Council of Norway, the authors note.    “Researchers are actively working to identify tests that may allow for screening for celiac disease in patients on a gluten-free diet,” said Dr. Maureen Leonard from Harvard Medical School’s Center for Celiac Research and Treatment in Boston, who was not involved in the study. “These are not clinically available tests and require further work before they are accurate and available for clinical use,” she said in an email.   “Additionally, these tests may benefit only people with a certain genetic background,” Leonard said. “Therefore, the general public should be aware that before self-imposing a gluten-free diet they must be tested for celiac disease.”    Celiac disease must be confirmed with a duodenal biopsy, Leonard added. “If a patient begins a gluten-free diet prior to being screened for celiac disease, all available blood tests to screen for celiac disease and duodenal biopsies will no longer be accurate.”   "
2kH2W5W,2017-12-22,Racial disparities in trauma deaths not seen with Tricare," (Reuters Health) - With the same health insurance and access to the same medical providers, black trauma patients may be no more likely to die than their white counterparts, a U.S. study suggests.    Even though all U.S. hospitals are required to treat trauma patients regardless of their ability to pay, plenty of previous research has found minority patients often have worse survival odds and more complications than white patients. One of the many reasons for this may be that white patients have better medical benefits and an easier time accessing and affording care.    For the current study, researchers examined data on 87,112 trauma patients with insurance through Tricare, the U.S. health program for military service members and their families. All of the patients were treated at military and civilian trauma centers from 2006 to 2014.   The mortality rate was 1.2 percent for both black and white patients, researchers report in the journal Surgery.    This suggests that giving patients all the same benefits and the same access to care can help eliminate historic racial disparities in trauma outcomes, said senior study author Dr. Andrew Schoenfeld, a researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.    “We believe this is the result of the effect of universal insurance and an equal access healthcare system,” Schoenfeld said by email.    While it might be tempting to attribute the lack of disparities in death rates to something unique about Tricare or the military culture, many of the patients were treated at civilian medical centers where the vast majority of patients were not active duty service members, Schoenfeld added.    Overall, 10 percent of the patients suffered major complications within 30 days and 13 percent had serious problems within 90 days, the study found.    About 9 percent of the patients had repeat hospitalizations, or readmissions, within 30 days of going home.    Black patients, however, were 9 percent less likely to experience major complications and 13 percent less likely to have repeat hospitalizations within 90 days of discharge.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how giving every patient the same insurance might influence trauma survival odds or other outcomes.    Another drawback of the study is that researchers relied on insurance claims data to assess how well patients did in the hospital, and these records may not capture all of the factors that can influence survival odds or the risk of complications, the authors note.    “This is an interesting paper but it is very far from being able to conclude that universal insurance and access eliminated disparities,” said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a researcher at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who wasn’t involved I the study.    “The people covered by Tricare are different than the general population – and the hospitals and health care institutions may be also,” Krumholz said by email.  “Making a causal inference is just not possible.”  "
2kH5YXL,2017-12-22,"Superficial touch therapy eases pain, reduces opioid dependency"," (Reuters Health) - Light massage can reduce pain, anxiety and the need for opioid medication in terminally ill patients, a Swedish study suggests.    “All end-of-life patients experience existential pain or existential suffering,” coauthor Linda Bjorkhem-Bergman told Reuters Health. “This pain is difficult to treat pharmacologically and complementary methods, such as massage, provide an alternative.”   Bergman and colleagues studied 41 hospice patients who received tactile massage of the hands, feet and/or back, depending upon the individual’s preference. Tactile massage is a type of light massage that does not involve deep tissue penetration.    During their stay in hospice, patients received an average of three treatments lasting 15 to 45 minutes. Afterward, their perceived pain, well-being and anxiety decreased by approximately 2 points on a 10-point scale, indicating an improvement. The effect was obvious after the first session and persisted after later treatments, researchers found.   Furthermore, patients requested just half their typical “rescue dose” medication in the 24 hours following the superficial touch therapy, according to the report in BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care.    Rescue doses are “extra” doses of pain or anxiolytic medication given over and above one’s typical dosage.    But why massage to just the hands, feet and back?   “It’s probably the stimulation of the more sensitive receptors in these areas of the skin that release positive hormones,” Dr. Bergman continues in an email.    The chief hormone released, oxytocin, is known to stimulate feelings of well-being and comfort, while cortisol and nitric oxide, both considered “stress” hormones that increase blood pressure and heart rate, are inhibited.    There were no adverse effects among patients in the present study, but the authors advise against tactile massage in people with terminal heart failure.   “It could be a risk factor because it might cause blood pressure to decrease even further,” says Bergman.    Healthcare cost is always an issue, regardless of treatment type. Asked if tactile massage might be a financially superior method to help palliative patients cope compared to standard pharmaceutical approaches, experts say, unfortunately, no.    “Morphine and other opioids are so cheap and therapists’ time is expensive,” Bergman said.    Still, “massage therapy can be an effective therapeutic modality that may be helpful . . . in cases where patients desire a more natural approach,” said JD Elder, a licensed massage therapist and Coordinator of Complementary Therapies at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.   An observational study such as this one can’t prove that tactile massage caused pain to ease. However, Elder said in an email, “We are tactile creatures and it’s the intent and delivery of the touch that matters. Massage therapists use their knowledge of anatomy to guide how they touch in a specific way for a specific intent say, to comfort or for rehabilitation.”  "
2kHQG5g,2017-12-22,Common blood pressure drug tied to increased risk of skin cancer," (Reuters Health) - People who take a certain water pill prescribed to control fluid retention and treat high blood pressure may be more likely to get skin cancer than other individuals, a Danish study suggests.    While the drug, hydrochlorothiazide, has long been linked to an increased risk of sunburns, the current study offers fresh evidence that this commonly prescribed medication may also make people more likely to develop two types of skin cancer: basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.    For the study, researchers examined national prescription registry data on hydrochlorothiazide use from 1995 to 2012 as well as cancer registry records on skin malignancies diagnosed from 2004 to 2012.    Overall, people who took hydrochlorothiazide daily for at least six years were 29 percent more likely to develop basal cell carcinoma and almost four times more likely to get squamous cell carcinoma than individuals who didn’t take this medication, the study found.    “We already knew that hydrochlorothiazide makes the skin more vulnerable to damage from UV light of sun or sunbeds,” said senior study author Anton Pottegard of the University of Southern Denmark.   “However, we did not know that hydrochlorothiazide use also appears to translate into an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer,” Pottegard said by email.    The study included more than 71,000 people with basal cell carcinoma, 8,600 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and a control group of more than 313,000 people in the Danish population who didn’t have these malignancies but were otherwise similar to the cancer patients.    About 2.7 percent of patients with basal cell carcinoma and 2.1 percent of the control group were high users of hydrochlorothiazide, with a lifetime cumulative dose of at least 50,000 milligrams, or roughly six years of daily use.    Ten percent of squamous cell carcinoma cases were high users, as were 2.8 percent of people in the control group.    With the highest cumulative hydrochlorothiazide exposure - approximately 24 years of daily use - patients were 54 percent more likely to develop basal cell carcinoma and more than seven times more likely to get squamous cell carcinoma.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how hydrochlorothiazide might cause skin cancer.    Another limitation is that researchers lacked data on two main factors that influence the risk of skin cancer: ultraviolet light exposure and skin type, the study authors note in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.    “There may be a relationship between taking hydrochlorothiazide and risk for skin cancer,” said Dr. Aaron Farberg of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.    “However, the relationship may not be directly causative,” Farberg, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Even so, the findings add to the evidence suggesting that patients taking hydrochlorothiazide should take extra precautions to protect their skin from damage caused by the sun, said Dr. Elizabeth Martin, president of Pure Dermatology & Aesthetics in Hoover, Alabama.    “Everyone can reduce their skin cancer risk by avoiding unprotected exposure to UV light,” Martin, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Don’t use indoor tanning devices, and protect yourself from the sun by seeking sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.”   Patients taking hydrochlorothiazide shouldn’t stop without first seeing a doctor, Pottegard cautioned. While there are other safe, affordable options to manage high blood pressure, patients already taking hydrochlorothiazide won’t meaningfully alter their skin cancer risk by staying on the drug for a few months until a physician can advise them, he said.    “If you are at an increased risk of skin cancer, due to high exposure to sunlight, have already experienced skin cancer, or are otherwise predisposed to skin cancer, you should consider consulting your physician regarding a potential therapy shift,” Pottegard said.

2Dndz5o,2017-12-21,HPV vaccine doesn’t lead to unsafe sex," (Reuters Health) - - Young women who get vaccinated against the cancer-causing human papillomavirus (HPV) understand that they still need condoms to protect against other sexually transmitted infections, a U.S. study confirms.    To see how vaccination influenced women’s attitudes about safe sex, researchers followed 91 women and girls for 30 months starting when they received their first dose of the HPV vaccine. When participants joined the study, they were 15 years old on average and none of them had had sex.    When researchers surveyed the young women at the start of the study, most thought it would be very risky to have sex without condoms. This opinion didn’t change over time, the study team reports in the Journal of Adolescent Health.    By the end of the study, 65 women, or 71 percent, were sexually active. The timing of their first sexual encounter wasn’t influenced by how concerned they had been about safe sex or catching sexually transmitted infections other than HPV.    “These findings suggest that young women understand that vaccination against HPV does not protect against infections other than HPV and that safer sexual behaviors like using condoms are still important,” said lead study author Dr. Tanya Kowalczyk Mullins of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in Ohio.    “Research demonstrates that HPV vaccination of adolescent women, whether sexually experienced at the time of vaccination or not, does not lead to riskier sexual behaviors,” Mullins said by email.    HPV is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Most infections don’t cause symptoms and go away on their own, but the virus is a still leading cause of cancer deaths among women worldwide. It can also cause genital warts and lesions in the upper respiratory tract.   In the U.S., the HPV vaccine is recommended for girls and boys at age 11 or 12 years, with the goal of protecting them against the virus before they become sexually active, and also for teens and young adults who may not have previously been vaccinated.   Many teens still don’t get the vaccine at least in part because parents fear it will encourage adolescents to start having sex too soon or without condoms.    The current study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how the HPV vaccine might influence when teens choose to have sex or if they practice safe sex. Because the vaccine is recommended for all youth to prevent cancer, it wouldn’t be ethical to do a controlled experiment depriving some participants of the vaccine.   Parents need to understand, and pediatricians should stress, that this vaccine is to prevent cancer caused by the majority of HPV infections and not a vaccine to prevent all sexually transmitted diseases in general, said Dr. Linda Fu, a pediatrician at Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C.   “If this message is being delivered to patients effectively, there should be no reason for vaccine recipients to believe that they are at lower risk for any STD other than HPV,” said Fu, who wasn’t involved in the study, in an email.    But it’s still important to keep talking to teens about safe sex and preventing sexually transmitted infections, said Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ committee on adolescence and a researcher at Seattle Children’s Hospital and the University of Washington.   “The young women in this study demonstrated appropriate risk perceptions,” Breuner, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “But parents and healthcare providers should continue to provide education to young women about the limitations of protection afforded by the HPV vaccine in order to facilitate development of appropriate risk perceptions among vaccinated young women,” Breuner advised.

2oXMVNB,2017-12-20,Growing number of U.S. hospitals can’t treat kids," (Reuters Health) - - A growing number of children who show up in U.S. emergency rooms can’t get the treatment they need at their local hospital and need to be transferred elsewhere for care, a new study suggests.    Overall, in California, Florida, Massachusetts and New York - four of the most populous U.S. states - pediatric transfers surged 25 percent: from roughly 64,000 in 2006 to close to 80,000 in 2011, researchers report in Pediatrics.    The biggest increase in transfers was for kids with common health problems like abdominal pain and asthma, offering fresh evidence that even basic pediatric care is disappearing from community hospitals, said senior study author Dr. Michael McManus of Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.   “When kids are taken to their local hospital’s emergency department, they are increasingly likely to be transferred to more distant referral centers for care they used to be able to get at home,” McManus said by email. “We now know that pretty much the same thing is happening across the country.”   The researchers examined data on more than 252 million hospital encounters for children and adults, including about 59 million that resulted in admissions.    During the study, adult admissions remained constant at more than 7.1 million a year.   But the annual number of pediatric admissions declined 9.3 percent from more than 545,000 in 2006 to slightly under 495,000 in 2011.    The range of conditions treated, also known as pediatric capacity, declined at hospitals in all four states.    Over the course of the study, capacity declined an average of 13 percent in California, 24 percent in Florida, 27 percent in New York and 25 percent in Massachusetts.    Across all four states, the ten conditions that had the biggest average reductions in availability of pediatric care at local hospitals included appendicitis, skin infections, asthma, broken legs and tonsillitis.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how transferring children from one hospital to another might impact the quality of their care. It’s possible that transfer might improve outcomes for some conditions and worsen outcomes for others, the study authors note.    “We know that patients want to be treated close to home if possible, but children are not just little adults,” said Dr. Fizan Abdullah, a researcher at the Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago and Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.    “They have special needs that can often best be treated by a pediatric specialist,” Abdullah said by email.    Those specialists tend to be located where other pediatric services are located, for instance in a facility that has a pediatric anesthesiologist who is trained in the nuances of working with children, Abdullah added. That’s why pediatric specialists tend to gravitate toward children’s hospitals that have extensive resources specifically for kids.    For care closer to home, telemedicine and second opinion consults are often options, connecting hospitals that are sometimes closer to home with a regional center, Abdullah said. Parents can also look for satellite outpatient centers that are affiliated with a hospital with pediatric specialists.     “The objective is to treat the child in the best way possible, with the most expertise, and get them home as soon as possible,” Abdullah said. “Physicians at the referring hospital, or children’s hospital, can then also continue to work with their local provider as needed.”   When families have a choice of health insurance, they should also make sure those hospitals caring for their kids are in their insurance network, McManus advised.    “For families taking sick kids to their local hospital, they should not be surprised if transfer is necessary to get the best care even for common conditions,” McManus said.

2klgCmO,2017-12-19,Nutrition lessons might help substance abusers," (Reuters Health) - Working with nutritionists might improve drug addicts’ odds of recovery, experts believe.                    A dormitory at Recovery Point, a center for overcoming addiction, in Huntington, West Virginia, U.S. on June 20, 2017.  REUTERS/Bryan Woolston      Registered dietician nutritionists could help patients at addiction recovery centers think about the ways food affects mental health, eating disorders and cravings, a team of authors argues in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.   Nutrition therapy could include cooking classes, mindful eating, and exploration of food fads and myths, they suggest.   “There really hasn’t been much conversation about substance use disorders and nutrition, unfortunately,” said lead study author David Wiss in email to Reuters Health.    Wiss, a registered dietician nutritionist, is the founder of Nutrition in Recovery LLC in Beverly Hills, California, which focuses on incorporating nutritionists into treatment centers.    About 21 million Americans ages 12 or older - or 8 percent - meet criteria for substance use disorder, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Poor nutrition and eating disorders are often secondary health effects that stem from substance abuse, both during use and after recovery.   Wiss and his coauthors Maria Schellenberger, of the University of Southern California at Los Angeles, and Michael Prelip, of the University of California, Los Angeles, point out that in 1990, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics published a position paper supporting the need for nutrition intervention in treatment and recovery from addiction.    The academy described registered dietitian nutritionists as essential members of the treatment team, but, “Unfortunately, the position paper had little impact, was not renewed, and limited progress has occurred in incorporating (these professional) into drug rehabilitation programs despite the continued growth of substance abuse,” Wiss, Schellenberger and Prelip write.   They say weekly group sessions on emotional eating and eating for mental health could focus on dietary deficiencies that alter mental status and ways to combat them with healthy food. They also suggest talking about the harms of inflammation, caffeine, and nicotine, as well as the benefits of anti-inflammatory foods, fiber, slow and mindful eating, and exercise.   Hands-on nutrition classes covering easy recipes, snack preparation, grocery shopping, and budgeting may help addicts transition to a healthy life at home after leaving the treatment center, they suggest.   At the same time, the efficacy of nutrition interventions in substance use disorder treatment settings is unproven. “Unfortunately, this type of data is difficult to obtain given the small sample sizes at treatment centers, presence of confounding variables and poor patient follow-up,” Wiss said.    “Given the high relapse rates with available treatments, it’s obviously important to investigate the effect of unconventional approaches on substance abuse problems,” said Dr. Fatih Canan of the University of Louisville School of Medicine in Kentucky. Canan, who wasn’t involved with this study, researches eating disorders and food addiction as it relates to substance abuse.    Canan is planning a study on food addiction treatment and relapse rates in patients with opioid use disorder. Future studies that evaluate different kinds of diets for patients with different substance abuse disorders may help, he said.   “The treatment of substance use disorders is complicated and multifaceted,” Canan told Reuters Health by email. “Nutritional interventions can be of help for certain patients.”  "
2Bz4gif,2017-12-19,Got sex questions? Google before you ask Siri," (Reuters Health) - - If you need to know how to have sex, use contraception or avoid sexually transmitted infections, you may want to do a Google search before you ask Siri for help, a new suggests.                     FILE PHOTO: A man checks his mobile phone next to an illuminated panel at Google stand during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, March 1, 2017. REUTERS/Paul Hanna/File Photo      When researchers posed similar sexual health questions to smartphone digital assistants like Siri and to Google’s online search engine, the web-based results were often more likely to provide accurate information.   “If people want to get internet-based sex advice or other health advice online, they should first probably do a laptop Google search according to our results, and then try Google Assistant – but not rule out other digital assistants such as Alexa and Bixby,” said lead study author Nick Wilson, a researcher at the University of Otago in Wellington, New Zealand.   “But if you want amusing wrong results - Siri is probably best,” Wilson said by email.    Two in five teens and adults go online looking for answers about sex, Wilson and colleagues note in The BMJ.    To see how well computers and smartphones may respond to these queries, researchers typed some common sexual health questions into Google’s online search engine and also spoke out loud to two smartphone tools, Siri and Google Assistant.    For each question, researchers checked answers for relevance and reliability. They gave higher marks to questions answered with links to credible public health sources like the UK National Health Service, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Planned Parenthood, or hospitals and universities.    Answers that sent people to less reliable sources of information like Wikipedia or product advertisements got lower marks.    Google online searches provided the best, or among the best, responses 72 percent of the time, compared with 50 percent of the time for Google Assistant and 32 percent of the time for Siri, the study found.    When researchers asked “how to have sex,” for example, Google searchers and Google Assistant sent people to instructional videos on how to use condoms or a YouTube video using a wooden penis that has over six million views, the study found.    But Google wasn’t perfect. In response to one question, Google offered a video clip entitled: “The 5 stupidest ways people die having sex.”   Siri didn’t find any videos of people having sex on the internet, the study found.    Even when researchers asked for pictures of people having sex, Siri offered some strange responses like pictures with aliens, what looked like men wrestling, and photos of people kissing.    When people asked for information about sexually transmitted infections, though, Siri came out on top. Siri offered nearby places to buy condoms or obtain emergency contraception.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how different online searches or digital assistants might be able to give people the best advice about sexual health.    Another limitation is that the performance of these tools can vary by device and change with software updates.    Still, the findings add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that online and digital technology can have some limitations when it comes to giving people accurate information about their health, said Dr. Karandeep Singh, a researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study.    When it comes to sex, however, it’s possible people might not always want to ask their smartphones for help, Singh said by email.    “The fact that questions need to be spoken aloud is a large enough barrier to privacy that people are more likely to direct sensitive questions to online searches as opposed to smartphone assistants,” Singh said.    “Besides digital assistants, technology savvy users have access to many other tools to ask for help or advice: online medical forums, patient communities like PatientsLikeMe, general question-answer apps like Quora, and tools to contact doctors online like HealthTap,” Singh added.    An Apple spokesperson declined to comment.  "
2BaEVOI,2017-12-18,Prenatal and early childhood fructose tied to asthma in kids," (Reuters Health) - - Grade school kids may be more likely to develop asthma if they consumed lots of drinks sweetened with sugar and high fructose corn syrup or if their mothers drank these beverages often during pregnancy, a recent study suggests.                     A bronchodilator is placed atop of a prescription treatment paper that belongs to Shahrour's son who is suffering from asthma, inside their home in the besieged town of Arbeen, in Damascus suburbs, Syria February 6, 2016. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh      To assess the connection between childhood asthma, sodas and other sugar-sweetened beverages, researchers examined data about eating habits from about 1,000 mother-child pairs as well as information on kids’ health, including whether they had an asthma diagnosis by ages 7 to 9.    After accounting for maternal obesity and other factors that can also influence kids’ odds of developing asthma, researchers found that women who consumed the most soda and sugary beverages during pregnancy were 70 percent more likely to have a child diagnosed with asthma by mid-childhood than mothers who never or rarely had sodas during pregnancy.    Women who had the most total fructose during pregnancy were 58 percent more likely to have kids with asthma than women who had little to no fructose.    “Previous studies have linked intake of sugary beverages with obesity, and obesity with asthma,” said study co-author Sheryl Rifas-Shiman, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute in Boston.    “In addition to influencing asthma through increasing the risk of obesity, we found that sugary beverages and high fructose may influence the risk of asthma not entirely through obesity,” Rifas-Shiman said by email. “This finding suggests that there are additional mechanisms by which sugary beverages and fructose influence asthma risk beyond their effects on obesity.”   What kids ate and drank also mattered. Even after accounting for prenatal exposure to sodas, kids who had the most total fructose in their diets earlier in childhood were 79 percent more likely to develop asthma than children who rarely or never had fructose.    Once researchers also factored in whether children were overweight or obese, kids with the highest fructose consumption were still 77 percent more likely to have asthma.    Mothers who consumed more sugary beverages tended to be heavier and have less income and education than women who generally avoided sodas and sweet drinks. But the connection between sodas, sugary drinks and childhood asthma persisted even after accounting for these factors.    “We don’t know for certain the exact pathways by which sugary beverages and fructose lead to asthma,” Rifas-Shiman said. “We believe at least in part they act by increasing inflammation, which may influence the child’s lung development.”   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how sodas or sugary drinks might cause asthma.    Another limitation is that researchers relied on women to accurately recall and report on soda consumption for themselves and their young children, which may not always be accurate, researchers note in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society.   Even so, the findings add to the evidence that women should avoid sodas and sugary foods and drinks during pregnancy and also limit these things for their young kids, said Dr. Leda Chatzi, a researcher at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Pregnant women should stay away from sugar sweetened drinks and foods with added sugars,” Chatzi said by email.    “Healthy eating during pregnancy is critical to their baby’s growth and development of chronic diseases such as asthma later in life,” Chatzi added. “A healthy dietary pattern during pregnancy contains a variety of food groups, including fruits and vegetables, breads and grains, protein sources and dairy products.”  "
2nVoMXc,2017-12-18,"Teen sexual identity, childhood trauma linked to suicidal behaviors"," (Reuters Health) - - Both LGBQ sexual identity and traumatic experiences in childhood are linked to a heightened risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, U.S. researchers say.                    A man holds a flag as he takes part in an annual Gay Pride Parade in Toronto June 28, 2009.      REUTERS/Mark Blinch      Teens who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or are questioning their sexual identity are also more likely than their heterosexual peers to have had adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in childhood, the study team reports in Journal of Adolescent Health.   Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and young adults and there is evidence that suicide rates are increasing in this age group, they write.   “It is imperative that we identify adolescent populations at greatest risk to guide our prevention efforts,” lead author Kristen Clements-Nolle, of the School of Community Health Sciences of the University of Nevada, Reno, told Reuters Health by email.   “Furthermore, cumulative exposure to ACEs greatly increased suicide risk behaviors among sexual minority adolescents. For example, compared with heterosexual students with no exposure to ACEs, LGB/not sure students with two or more ACEs had approximately 13 times higher odds of attempting suicide in the past year,” Clements-Nolle said.   To examine the relationships among teen sexual identity, childhood trauma and suicide risk, Clements-Nolle and colleagues enrolled approximately 5,000 students from 97 high schools in Nevada to fill out questionnaires and answer questions about their sexual identity and exposure to adverse childhood experiences.    Adverse childhood events included such things as being physically forced to have sex with someone, or being beaten, kicked or physically hurt by an adult. In addition, students were asked about their exposure to domestic violence, mental illness and substance abuse by family members.    Participants were also asked if they had ever seriously considered suicide during the past year and how many times had they attempted suicide during that time.     About 10 percent of students self-identified as lesbian, gay or bisexual (LGB), and nearly 5 percent were not sure of their sexual identity. Just over 85 percent of students identified as heterosexual.   The LGB and questioning students were more likely to be exposed to adverse childhood events.  More than half of LGB and 40 percent of questioning students reported at least two ACEs, compared to about one-quarter of heterosexual students reporting the same exposure.   For all students, the greater the number of adverse experiences they reported, the greater was their risk of having had suicidal thoughts during the past year.   Sexual identity was also linked to risk of suicidal thinking. Compared with heterosexual students with no ACEs, LGB and questioning students overall were three times more likely to report suicidal thoughts.    LGB and questioning students who reported one ACE were almost 7 times more likely to think about suicide compared to heterosexual students with one ACE. With three or more ACEs, LGB and questioning students were 14 times more likely to think about suicide compared to heterosexual counterparts.   Compared to heterosexual students with no ACEs, LGB and unsure students were almost 4 times more likely to have attempted suicide.    “Studies have shown that family acceptance and parental caring may reduce suicidal behaviors among LGB adolescents and young adults,” Clements-Nolle said.   Future research should evaluate whether interventions that support families with sexual minority youth and promote acceptance of adolescent sexual identity can also impact childhood victimization and household dysfunction, said Clements-Nolle.   “While the assessment of intervention effectiveness was beyond the scope of the current study, the higher prevalence of ACEs among adolescents who are LGB or are not sure of their sexual identity and the demonstrated inﬂuence on suicide risk behaviors highlight the need to ensure that suicide prevention efforts for sexual minority youth are trauma-informed,” Clements-Nolle said.

2AUZj2d,2017-12-18,Probiotics and xylitol don’t help sore throats," (Reuters Health) - - Two potential remedies for bacterial infections, probiotics and xylitol, didn’t ease sore throat symptoms in an experiment designed to see whether these options might be used to curb overuse of antibiotics.    Antibiotics don’t help viral infections, which cause the majority of sore throats. Doctors still regularly prescribe antibiotics for sore throats, however, and excessive use has given rise to so-called super bugs that can cause severe infections and don’t respond to available treatments.    Because bacterial infections can cause some sore throats - such as “strep throat,” caused by Streptococcal bacteria - researchers wanted to see if one of two plausible options might help: xylitol, a birch sugar that has been linked to reduced bacterial growth and inflammation in the mouth, or probiotics, harmless bacteria that can block the spread of some harmful bacterial infections.   The researchers randomly assigned nearly 1,000 people with sore throats to one of four regimens: chewing gum containing xylitol; probiotic capsules; both treatments combined; or a control group that only got a different gum without xylitol.     They found that xylitol and probiotics didn’t work any better than the gum without any remedy at all, according to the report in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.    “We were hoping that one or the other would prove beneficial in sore throat but unfortunately not,” said senior study author Michael Moore of the University of Southampton in the UK.    “It was not clear before the trial whether they would be helpful or not, but it is a priority to find alternative approaches to treatment that don’t involve antibiotics so it was worth testing out these two potential treatments,” Moore said by email.    The study included 934 people, with complete data on the effect of the remedies available for 689 individuals.    All of the study participants came to the doctor complaining of a sore throat. At the initial exams, about two-thirds had inflammation in their throat and more than half had a cough.    Most had also experienced at least one previous sore throat in the previous three months, and more than 30 percent had at least three sore throat episodes.    They were randomly assigned to one of the four treatment groups, and then asked to record a diary of symptoms and the number of probiotic capsules or sticks of gum they had each day depending on what group they were in.    If gum was part of their regimen, participants were asked to chew five pieces daily. If their treatment included probiotics, they were asked to take one capsule daily with milk.    Participants were considered compliant with their assigned treatment if they followed these directions at least 75 percent of the time.    After three months, participants didn’t report any meaningful difference in the severity of sore throat symptoms or difficulty swallowing based on what group they were in.    One limitation of the study is that many participants dropped out before three months or didn’t provide complete data, the authors note. Another drawback is that the study wasn’t long enough to assess whether the tested remedies might help in the long run if people got recurring sore throats.    Still, the findings suggest there is no reason for doctors to prescribe probiotics or xylitol for sore throats, the researchers conclude.    For patients with strep throat, penicillin works and antibiotics are an effective and appropriate treatment, noted Dr. Jeffrey Linder, a researcher at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.    “Most sore throats are not strep and should be treated symptomatically,” Linder, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    This means getting plenty of rest, drinking plenty of fluids, and taking over the counter medications for inflammation and pain, Linder advised.    “You should only take antibiotics if you have a positive test for strep throat,” Linder added.

2CcUW3t,2017-12-15,Executive function declines long-term after &#039;transient&#039; brain attacks," (Reuters Health) - People who have so-called transient neurological attacks, including brief mini-strokes, may develop cognitive problems that linger for months, a recent study suggests.   Dutch researchers looked at long-term mental functioning in people who had experienced brief neurological attacks, which can occur when blood vessels in the brain are damaged or temporarily blocked and include transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), often called mini-strokes.    The study team did brain scans and cognitive assessments of 150 people within a few days after the patients had a transient neurological attack. In cognitive tests repeated six months later, participants did worse in executive function skills needed for things like attention and time management.    “Executive function is less visible compared to walking and talking, but the latter may be given most attention in the acute phase,” said senior study author Dr. Ewoud van Dijk of Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center in the Netherlands.   During a mini-stroke, or TIA, people may notice the sudden onset of symptoms like numbness or weakness in the arm, leg or face, especially on one side of the body; confusion or difficulty talking; vision problems or dizziness and loss of balance. These symptoms often clear up within 24 hours.    While previous research has also linked mini-stroke to a decline in executive function, the current study findings suggest that subtle changes in the brain may occur that aren’t immediately detectable.    Patients in the study were 65 years old on average.    Overall, 73 participants, or 60 percent, were diagnosed with mini-stroke, and the remaining 48 patients were diagnosed with other types of transient neurological attack.    Brain scans done at the start of the study showed 32 patients had brain lesions, or abnormal tissue, which can include damage to blood vessels and cells.    On cognitive tests done at the start of the study, people with brain lesions scored worse on every type of function assessment compared to patients without lesions, the researchers report in Stroke.    But after accounting for other factors that could influence these results such as age, sex, and education, the only difference that was still statistically meaningful was the lag in executive function.    More research is needed to determine exactly how a mini-stroke might lead to diminished executive function and to get a better understanding of which patients are at highest risk, van Dijk said by email.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how a mini-stroke contributes to cognitive problems in general or deficits in executive function in particular.    Beyond its small size, another limitation is the relatively young and healthy group of participants, which may have led researchers to underestimate the magnitude of cognitive problems that can follow a mini-stroke, the authors note.    “This small study underscores the need for future trials to determine whether executive function continues to decline further out from the stroke such as 1 or 2 years,” said Sandra Billinger, a stroke researcher at Kansas University Medical Center in Kansas City who wasn’t involved in the study.    Patients should still be alert for potential changes, though, because many people don’t necessarily have a follow-up appointment after a mini-stroke and any decline in thinking abilities might not be noticed until later, Billinger said by email.    Ideally, patients can work to prevent a mini-stroke by doing things that are healthy for their brain and heart, like controlling their blood pressure and keeping physically and mentally fit, said Sarah Pendlebury, a neuroscience researcher at the University of Oxford in the UK who wasn’t involved in the study.    If they do have a mini-stroke, they can still do these things to try to minimize the odds of another one, Pendlebury said by email.   “There needs to be robust secondary prevention treatment to reduce the risk of another and possibly more major event,” Pendlebury added. “At the moment there is no specific treatment for executive function problems other than keeping physically and mentally active.”  "
2jWlmz1,2017-12-14,"Social media may help chronically ill connect to doctors, fellow patients"," (Reuters Health) - Social media groups that bring together patients, family, friends and healthcare providers can improve patients’ outlook and reduce their anxiety and depression, a recent U.S. study suggests.   In a nine-month experiment with liver-transplant patients, researchers found that participants came to rely heavily on a closed Facebook group, both for information about their condition and help in coping.   “Ninety percent of Americans are on the internet and 80 percent are using platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to find healthcare information from a supportive online community,” said Dr. Sean Langenfeld, of the Department of Surgery at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It’s a very powerful tool and offers a great way to facilitate communication among those suffering from abdominal pain or migraines to individuals diagnosed with cancer.”    For the current study, Dr. Vikrom Dhar of the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in Ohio and his colleagues created a closed Facebook group that ultimately had a total of 350 members, about half of whom were liver transplant patients, 36 percent were family and friends and 14 percent were healthcare providers.   Of the 78 healthcare providers who were part of the hospital’s liver transplant team, 49 were active members of the group, including 7 out of the 16 physicians.   The researchers monitored the group’s interactions and surveyed a subset of participants after nine months.    Dhar’s team found that engagement with the group was high, and 83 percent of participants posted or reacted to others’ posts at least once per month. While patients tended to post supportive messages or inspirational content, the healthcare providers mainly posted educational information.   After nine months, 95 percent of the survey participants said that joining the group had a positive impact on their care, and 97 percent said their main motivation for joining was to get support from other patients and to provide it.     Social media also allows for patient-practitioner interaction between visits to the hospital or clinic, the study team notes in the journal Surgery.    This is especially important for those suffering from alcohol-related end-stage liver disease, Dhar said. “Previous reports in literature have suggested that patients who have appropriate social support have lower rates of alcohol relapse following transplantation,” he told Reuters Health in an email. “Thus, by using social media platforms, physicians may offer social support resources to patients who otherwise may suffer from disparities in accessing such care.”    Still, healthcare providers remain hesitant to engage patients through social media, the study team writes.   A 140-character tweet can result in misinterpretation of medical advice. Without a disclaimer, doctors risk being liable, Langenfeld noted. What’s more, the line between personal and professional engagement is, at best, blurred.    “Never assume there is privacy on the internet,” Langenfeld said in a telephone interview. “Statistics are vague, but in recent years over 50 percent of medical boards have inflicted serious punishment as a result of irresponsible online behavior.” This includes irresponsible behavior unrelated to one’s medical specialty.    It makes sense that the number of teaching hospitals offering social media responsibility courses is on the rise, Dhar said.    “Our study shows that in appropriate settings, physicians can utilize social media platforms including Facebook to create content that patients find positively impacts their healthcare.”   "
2jTFrGg,2017-12-14,"Childhood obesity climbing with media use, European doctors warn"," (Reuters Health) - Children’s waistlines have been expanding in lock step with the amount of time they spend with televisions, computers, smartphones and tablets, European doctors say.    In the past 25 years, obesity rates have climbed rapidly among European children and teens, according to a consensus statement from the European Academy of Pediatrics and the European Childhood Obesity Group published in Acta Paediatrica.    Roughly one in five kids and teens in Europe are overweight or obese, according to a 2017 World Health Organization study, the authors note.    Today, 97 percent of European households have a TV in their home, 72 percent have a computer, 68 percent have internet access and 91 percent have mobile phones, according to the statement.    This has spurred a surge in screen time, contributing to inadequate sleep, worse eating habits and less exercise - all of which can make it easy for children to become overweight, the statement authors argue.    “Mass media has been shown to have a broad effect on children’s health and can affect them physiologically and have an impact on their socio-cultural functioning and psychological wellbeing,” said senior author of the statement, Dr. Adamos Hadjipanayis, a researcher at European University Cyprus in Nicosia and secretary general of the European Academy of Pediatrics.   “There is evidence of a strong link between obesity levels across European countries and childhood media exposure,” Hadjipanayis said by email.    Parents are part of the problem, Hadjipanayis and colleagues argue.    Even as children’s screen time rises, parents demonstrate little awareness about what their kids do online or how much time they spend with tablets, smartphones and computers, the statement emphasizes.    Food advertising is another problem, because it can convince kids to crave and demand more junk food and make them less likely to eat their fruits and veggies, the statement also notes. Kids also tend to consume a large portion of their daily calories while watching TV, when ads may influence their food choices.   The fix is more vigilance, the authors argue.   “When their TV time goes down, so does their (weight),” said Dr. David Hill, chair, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Council on Communications and Media and a researcher at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill.    “Food advertising seems to drive this relationship, as opposed to decreased activity. Sleep is also a major concern,” Hill, who wasn’t involved in the statement, said by email. “Screen media before bedtime interfere with sleep quality and duration, and poor sleep contributes to obesity.”   The APP has tips for parents on managing media online, Hill said ( bit.ly/2epneyO ).   Common sense should prevail, said Dr. Jennifer Emond, a researcher at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College in Lebanon, New Hampshire, who wasn’t involved in the statement.   “Limit media time each day, no media in the bedroom and ensure the media children are exposed to is high quality,” Emond said by email. “Regarding social media, parents should have access to their children’s social media sites and monitor their children’s interaction with social media - that has benefits beyond promoting a healthy weight.”   Parents of children who are already spending hours a day online and watching various screens may want to cut back media use gradually to make changes more effective, said Erica Kenney, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston who wasn’t involved in the statement.    “If parents find that their kids are using media for something like 7 hours a day or more, which seems pretty typical . . . , trying all of a sudden to get that down to 2 hours a day is probably not going to be successful,” Kenney said by email. “Gradually implementing rules to help kids cut down on their use is probably going to work better.”  "
2BMb3VL,2017-12-14,U.S. less generous than European nations with development assistance," (Reuters Health) - The U.S. contributes more than any other nation in development assistance for health to low- and middle-income countries, but its generosity falls short when compared in terms of size and wealth, a new study found.   Norway, Denmark, Luxembourg and the UK each provided substantially more assistance for health relative to the size of their populations, their public spending and their economies, the Health Affairs study shows.   Each resident of Norway provided $149 in annual assistance for health to low- and middle-income nations, while each resident of the U.S. provided $41 in recent years, the analysis found.    “The study shows that the U.S. has been quite generous in its support of global health, which has saved millions of lives,” said Jen Kates, vice president and director of global health and HIV policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation in Washington, DC.    “But it also may help to show that, despite concerns about the U.S. spending ‘too much,’ it really depends on how that is measured,” Kates, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.   Senior author Joseph Dieleman analyzed 23 countries’ donations from 2014 through 2016 in an effort to gauge the relative charity of the U.S. in light of concerns about the impact of a Trump administration proposal to cut nearly one-quarter of the development-assistance budget.    “These cuts have very real consequences,” said Dieleman, a health economist and professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.   U.S. global health assistance has been spent on maternal, newborn and child health and to combat tuberculosis and HIV. Much of U.S. development assistance has been used to prevent, diagnose and treat HIV infections and to attack emerging epidemics like Zika and Ebola, Dieleman said in a phone interview.   “HIV is one of the amazing stories,” he said. “Mortality rates in the 1990s and early 2000s in developing countries, some of the poorest countries in the world, were double what they are now.”   “As soon as you start taking away money, there could be increases in incidences and the mortality rates could climb,” he said. Likewise, if developing nations are unable to contain emerging epidemics, local epidemics are more likely to turn into global epidemics, he said.   Kates and her colleagues have predicted the proposed U.S. cuts could lead to as many as another 198,700 HIV infections and 31,100 tuberculosis infections.    More than 87 percent of global disease burden was in low- and middle-income countries, while only 35 percent of global health dollars were spent in those countries.    Norway, Denmark, Luxembourg and the UK were the most generous providers of development assistance for health, with each country contributing more than $1,500 for every $1 million in national income, the study found. By the same metric, the U.S. was the seventh most generous contributor, spending $714 for every $1 million in national income.   Norwegians and Luxembourgers each contributed nearly 50 percent more than citizens of any other country and more than 200 percent of what Americans contribute, the study found.   Norway spent 2.3 percent of its health spending on international health, compared to the U.S., which spent 0.4 percent.   “The U.S. has the largest footprint in global health in the world,” Kates said. “A reduction of U.S. support would have an outsized effect on the health of those in low- and middle-income countries.”  "
2BiMbb8,2017-12-14,Brain cells develop more mutations as we age," (Reuters Health) - Brain cells - neurons - develop gene mutations over the course of a lifetime, contributing to normal aging and potentially presenting a target for treatments that stave off dementia and other types of cognitive decline, researchers say.   The team developed a way to sequence the genomes of individual neurons, which allowed them to see what changes are normal and also what happens in specific brain diseases.   “The work is at a very early stage,” senior study author Dr. Christopher A. Walsh from Harvard Medical School in Boston told Reuters Health by email. “We have only just developed a method that we hope will give us new insight into how neurons age, and we hope to use it to understand more about common forms of dementia and degeneration.”    Scientists have long thought that aging and degenerative brain diseases are associated with genetic changes in brain cells, but until now, they haven’t had the technology to test this theory.    Dr. Walsh’s team found a way to look at all the genes within a single neuron and then analyzed neurons from the cadavers of 15 neurologically normal individuals aged 4 months to 82 years. The also looked at nine people diagnosed with Cockayne syndrome (CS) or Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), conditions caused by defects in DNA damage repair that are associated with brain degeneration and premature aging.    Just like cells throughout the rest of the body, the researchers found that genetic mutations increased in number with increasing age in normal neurons. But, they noted, brain regions associated with age-related degenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and age-related cognitive decline were especially affected, according to the report in the journal Science.    Autopsy specimens from brains of patients with CS and XP also showed increased numbers of mutations, which were more than twice as common as those seen in brain cells from individuals of the same age without those diseases.    The researchers found that mutations start occurring even as the brain is still developing in an infant, and they estimate that by the age of 1 year, normal brain cells have 600 to 900 single-letter changes in their genes. By the time someone is in their 80s, there are an estimated 2,400 changes.    The study team also identified three patterns of mutations in brain cells across a lifetime. In one, which they called Signature A, mutations increased with age regardless of brain region. In another, which they called Signature B, mutations were increased in brain regions associated with Alzheimer’s disease but not in areas associated with age-related cognitive decline.    The third pattern, Signature C, showed a different class of genetic mutations that are characteristic of oxidative damage, and were most common in patients with CS and XP but also increased with age in normal neurons.    The researchers summarized this accumulation of genetic mutations, a form of cellular senescence, in a single term: genosenium (aging of the genome).    “I found it surprising not just that the number of mutations increases with age, which we sort of expected to see (though we did not know how, or how fast, they would accumulate), but that some types of mutations accumulate with age (Signature A), and other biochemically distinct types of mutations (Signature B) are present at birth and don’t’ accumulate with age at all,” Dr. Walsh said.    “To be able to have the precision to dissect out these different types of mutations was more than we could have hoped for,” he added. “We also find that different people may accumulate mutations at different rates, and we need to know what might control that.”   “I was surprised to see the quite clear correlation of somatic mutations with age using a relatively small number of neurons,” said Dr. Sarah E. Harris, a specialist in genetics at the University of Edinburgh Center for Cognitive Aging and Cognitive Epidemiology in the UK, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “As a geneticist interested in determining genetic influences on cognitive ageing, it’s fantastic to see the technique of single-cell whole-genome sequencing being used to identify mutations in the brain that are acquired during the life-course,” she told Reuters Health by email.

2CcPmhK,2017-12-13,Music therapy may help ease depression," (Reuters Health) - Traditional depression treatments like psychotherapy or medication might work better for some patients when doctors add a dose of music therapy, a research review suggests.    Researchers examined data on 421 people who participated in nine previously completed short-term experiments testing the benefits of music therapy on its own or added to traditional interventions for depression.    Overall, the analysis found patients felt less depressed when music was added to their treatment regimen, according to the analysis in the Cochrane Library.    Music therapy also appeared to help ease anxiety and improve functioning in depressed individuals, and it appeared just as safe as traditional treatments.    “We can now be more confident that music therapy in fact improves patients’ symptoms and functioning, and that this finding holds across a variety of settings, countries, types of patients, and types of music therapy,” said senior study author Christian Gold of Uni Research Health in Bergen, Norway.   More than 300 million people worldwide have depression, which is projected to become the leading cause of disability by 2020, Gold and colleagues write.    Music therapy can include passive approaches that involve listening, active treatments that involve playing an instrument or singing or participating in a musical performance, or some combination of these approaches. What sets therapy apart from other musical endeavors is that it is typically led by a person with training in counseling, psychology or treating depression.    Even though music therapy has long been used all over the world, research to date hasn’t offered a clear picture of its benefits, Gold said.    The last review of music therapy published by Cochrane in 2008 didn’t offer as much evidence of benefits, Gold said. A milestone study that came out in 2011 concluded that music could help but was only done in one country and left many unanswered questions, he said.    “The present review update confirms these findings and broadens them,” Gold said by email. “We still think that more research is needed; however, we feel that research on music therapy for depression can now turn to more specific questions, such as comparing different types of therapy to each other.”   Studies included in the current review ranged in duration from six to 12 weeks. The smallest study had just 14 participants, and the largest one included 79 people.    The total number of treatment sessions ranged from eight to 48, and the duration of sessions varied from 20 minutes to two hours.    Only one of the studies in the analysis compared active versus passive music therapy, and it didn’t find a difference in the short-term severity of depression.    “The most important finding is that music therapy shows short-term beneficial effects for people with depression when added on top of baseline psychological or pharmacological treatment,” said Dr. Gjin Ndrepepa, a researcher at Technical University in Munich, Germany, who wasn’t involved in the study.    How it works isn’t clear, Ndrepepa said by email.    But modern brain imaging studies have shown that music therapy activates regions of the brain that are involved in regulating emotions. Joyful and sad music can have different effects, too, Ndrepepa added.    More research is still needed to figure out what type of music therapy works best for specific patient situations, Gold said.    “Until we have more specific research results comparing different music therapies to each other, music therapy should be seen as one of a variety of options,” Gold said. “It is important to have choices because no therapy works for everyone.”  "
2Ca7Cbw,2017-12-13,Shift work linked to burnout in sleep-deprived nurses," (Reuters Health) - Shift-work nurses who have sleep problems are more likely to experience career burnout that has the potential to compromise their job performance, a small Italian study suggests.    Researchers studied 315 nurses who worked rotating shifts in 39 wards of seven Italian hospitals. Each week, nurses worked an average of 36 hours and typically had at least one shift starting in the morning, the afternoon and the evening.    Overall, 52 percent of the nurses reported sleep difficulties and 31 percent reported feelings of career burnout.    Nurses who reported poor sleep quality, disturbed sleep, reliance on sleep medications or daytime impairment related to sleep issues were at least two times more likely to report burnout than nurses who didn’t have these sleep issues, Loreto Lancia of the University of L’Aquila in Italy and colleagues note.    “Burnout syndrome in nurses is associated with decreased patient satisfaction, reduced quality of care, medication errors, higher rates of healthcare related infections and higher mortality rates,” said Meredith Mealer, a researcher at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Denver VA Medical Center who wasn’t involved in the study.   “What this study adds to the literature is that there is a direct association between shift work and burnout syndrome,” Mealer said by email.    Working rotational shifts or night shifts can alter the normal circadian rhythm, the body’s internal clock that regulates sleeping patterns and eating patterns, Mealer added.   “This internal clock adapts slowly to transitions between different shift schedules, leading to issues with metabolism and the release of hormones, body temperature, alertness, sleep and performance,” Mealer said.    In the study, 60 percent of the nurses worked a so-called “long cycle” with two morning shifts, followed by two afternoon shifts, two night shifts, and three days off. The rest worked what researchers called a “short cycle” with one morning shift, one afternoon shift, one night shift and then two days off.    Compared to nurses on the short cycle, people working a long cycle were 41 percent more likely to experience burnout, researchers report in the Journal of Advanced Nursing.    A long cycle was also associated with higher odds of impaired sleep quality, but the difference was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    One limitation of the study is that the small sample of nurses might make it difficult to draw broad conclusions about how shift work might impact nurses elsewhere.    The rotating shifts in the study may be common in Italy, but they’re not the norm in the U.S., noted Ann Rogers, a researcher at the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing at Emory University in Atlanta who wasn’t involved in the study. Many nurses in the U.S., for example, work 12 hour shifts on either days or nights, not both, Rogers said by email.    Because the study wasn’t a controlled experiment, it’s also impossible to know whether sleep caused burnout or if burnout preceded difficulties with sleep, Rogers noted.    “The Italian nurses in this study worked rotating shifts, which means that their circadian rhythms for sleeping, eating, and alertness are never aligned,” Rogers said.  “When they get off work in the morning, they have to try to fall asleep in the daylight when their body temperature is rising, making it hard to fall asleep – and if you don’t get enough sleep, your ability to concentrate is impaired.”  "
2ymIURZ,2017-12-13,Diabetes and obesity both tied to higher risk of cancer," (Reuters Health) - Many cancer cases worldwide may happen at least in part because people are overweight or have diabetes, a new report suggests.    Diabetes and being overweight or obese were a factor in 5.6 percent of new cancer cases worldwide in 2012, or about 792,600 cases, the authors say.    Researchers examined rates of 12 types of cancer from 175 countries in 2012. Then, because cancer can take a long time to develop, they looked back at 2002 data on rates of overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes, which is caused in part by obesity.    Overall, about 544,000 cancer cases, or about 3.9 percent of the total, were linked with a high body-mass index (BMI, a ratio of weight to height), and 280,000, or 2 percent, were linked with diabetes.   A BMI of 25 or higher indicates overweight, and a BMI of 30 or higher indicates obesity. (A BMI calculator is available online here:  bit.ly/2tXeEf4. )   “Increases in diabetes and high BMI worldwide could lead to a substantial increase in the proportion of cancers attributable to these risk factors, if nothing is done to reduce them,” said lead study author Dr. Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard of Imperial College London in the UK.   “These projections are particularly alarming when considering the high and increasing cost of cancer and metabolic diseases, and highlight the need to improve control measures, and increase awareness of the link between cancer, diabetes, and high BMI,” Pearson-Stuttard said in a statement.    Worldwide, an estimated 422 million adults have diabetes and more than 2 billion adults are overweight or obese, researchers report in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology.    Both high BMI and diabetes are risk factors for various types of cancer, potentially due to biological changes caused by these conditions – such as high insulin, high blood sugar levels, chronic inflammation, and dysregulated sex hormones such as estrogen.   The biggest proportion of cancer cases related to diabetes and high BMI - about 38 percent - occurred in high-income western countries, followed by east and southeast Asian countries at about 24 percent.    Although cancers are still less common in some low and middle-income countries than in high-income nations, these countries had particularly large impacts from diabetes and high BMI.    For example, between 9 percent and 14 percent of all cancer cases in Mongolia, Egypt, Kuwait, and Vanuatu were tied to high BMI and diabetes.    Globally, liver cancer and endometrial cancer contributed the highest number of cancer cases related to diabetes and high BMI, at 25 percent and 38 percent, respectively.   By 2025, growing rates of diabetes and obesity could contribute to a 30 percent increase in the number of cancers related to these conditions in women, and a 20 percent increase in related cancers in men, researchers estimated.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how diabetes or obesity directly cause cancer. Another limitation is that because many cancers can take years to develop, a decade-long study might underestimate the connection between cancer and these other health problems.    “Perhaps most surprising is that the already striking findings of the study are likely to be underestimates of the true impact of obesity and diabetes on cancer rates,” said Dr. Graham Colditz, author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri.    The biggest increases in weight and diabetes-related cancers were seen in low and middle-income countries, where rates of overweight and obesity have been rising dramatically in recent years, Colditz noted.    “It is hard to overstate the importance of working to maintain a healthy weight,” Colditz said by email. “It lowers the risk of multiple cancers – as well as diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, and arthritis.”  "
2AOWhgC,2017-12-12,Many young U.S. men at high risk for HIV do not take anti-HIV pill," (Reuters Health) - Less than 4 percent of young adult men-who-have-sex-with-men in the U.S. – a population at significant risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) – reported ever using the pill that protects them from the virus, in a recently published study.   The data were drawn from an anonymous online survey of 2,347 black, white and Hispanic males, ages 18 to 24, who had previously engaged in anal sex with another man and had never had an HIV-positive blood test.    Those at high risk for HIV should ideally take a daily pill to lower their likelihood of infection. So-called pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) cuts the risk of getting HIV from sex by more than 90%, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).    “We have had a sense that PrEP is not reaching the communities that could benefit from it most, but the overall level of 3.4% is surprisingly low,” said Dr. Ryan Westergaard, an infectious disease physician at UW Health in Madison, Wisconsin, who was not involved in the study.   PrEP is typically administered in the form of a pill that combines two anti-HIV drugs, emtricitabine and tenofovir. Approved in the U.S. in 2012, the pill is marketed by Gilead Sciences Inc. under the brand name Truvada.   The incidence of HIV, which can be spread through anal or vaginal sex or by sharing needles with an infected person, has been falling in recent years. But men-who-have-sex-with-men bear the greatest burden of risk, the CDC says. In 2015, youth ages 13 to 24 accounted for over a fifth of all new diagnoses, and most occurred in gay and bisexual males, the agency found.    The current study was conducted by Sarah Marks at Alpert Medical School of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island and colleagues.    The overwhelming majority of participants had at least some college education, health insurance and access to a primary healthcare provider (PCP)/clinic, according to the researchers. Some 65% of survey participants who said they didn’t use PrEP met at least one CDC criterion for PrEP use, primarily condom-less anal intercourse in the preceding six months.   Dr. Margaret Hoffman-Terry, who chairs the board of directors of the American Academy of HIV Medicine, said her biggest takeaway from the study was that the majority of PrEP-eligible men did not receive it.    “Even in those with insurance and a primary care provider, usage was low,” she noted.    “Further bad news . . . . is the finding that PrEP uptake is lowest in communities that have particularly high HIV risk, including youth, people living in the South, and those who aren’t already engaged in regular primary health care,” added Westergaard in an email.    Mirroring national trends, blacks and Hispanics were more likely than whites to lack health insurance and/or a PCP/clinic, which is particularly problematic because HIV infection incidence remains highest among black and Hispanic men-who-have-sex-with-men, the research team reported in the journal AIDS Patient Care and STDs.    The survey participants were recruited on social media platforms in the second half of 2014, but more recent data might look different. Gilead reported at an HIV conference in July that the number of PrEP users in the U.S. now exceeds 100,000.   “The rollout of PrEP took some time, and even early providers like our clinic . . . did not begin offering PrEP until late 2014”, said Jennifer Hecht, senior director of program strategy and evaluation at the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, who was not involved in the study.    The research team acknowledged several other limitations of their study. Although responses were anonymous, answers were self-reported, so their veracity cannot be assured. The survey also did not ask participants whether they were in monogamous relationships in which one partner is HIV negative and the other is HIV positive, or had a sexually transmitted infection in the preceding six months, both of which are indicators for PrEP use.

2AaYoxz,2017-12-11,Air pollution fine particles linked to poor sperm quality," (Reuters Health) - Exposure to fine particles in air pollution may be another factor that affects men’s sperm quality and their fertility, suggest researchers in Taiwan.    Although the clinical effect may be small, the findings could be important from a public health perspective due to worldwide exposure to pollution, the authors write in BMJ Occupational and Environmental Medicine.   “Particulate matter contains many toxic chemicals such as heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which have demonstrated harmful to semen quality in laboratory and animal studies,” lead author Xiang Qian Lao told Reuters Health in an email.   “Sperm shape and size is an important parameter for fertility. Lower percentage/number of normal sperm may cause infertility,” said Lao, a researcher with the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.   Although exposure to environmental chemicals has long been considered a potential contributor to infertility, little is known about the effect of air pollution, the study team writes.   They looked at both short-term and long-term exposure to the very fine particles in air pollution known as PM 2.5, which are 2.5 microns or less - about thirty times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. These fine particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream.     This kind of particle pollution can be found both indoors and outdoors and most often comes from vehicle exhaust, the burning of wood, crops, coal or heating oil, and from emissions given off by power plants and other industries.    Cities in China and India have recently been struggling with PM 2.5 pollution levels much higher than is considered safe by the World Health Organization (WHO).   Lao’s team analyzed health exam records and health questionnaires for nearly 6,500 Taiwanese men ages 15 to 49 who participated in a medical examination program between 2001 and 2014.     Semen samples were taken and the men’s sperm quality was assessed for the total sperm number, as well as their size, shape and ability to move.   Because it takes about three months for a man to make new sperm, the researchers used each participant’s address as well as satellite data to estimate his exposure to PM 2.5 pollution over a three-month period as well as his average exposure over two years. Both long- and short-term average particle concentrations were typically within the safe range, with about half below 26 micrograms of particle pollution per cubic meter of air.    For every incremental exposure increase of 5 micrograms, however, researchers found that men’s sperm concentration increased slightly while their risk of abnormally shaped sperm rose by 18 percent with short-term exposure and 26 percent with long-term exposure.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to determine whether or how PM 2.5 pollution may affect sperm.   Still, Lao said, “Given the ubiquity of exposure to air pollution, a small effect size of PM 2.5 on sperm normal morphology may result in a significant number of couples with infertility. Thus, global strategies are necessary to minimize the impact of air pollution on reproductive health.”   The primary finding of this study is a significant decrease in the percentage of sperm that are normally shaped with increasing air pollution (PM 2.5), but the percentage of sperm that are morphologically normal is still very high, said Shanna Swan, a researcher with the Environmental Medicine and Public Health department at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.    The change in sperm concentration is difficult to interpret, noted Swann, who wasn’t involved in the study. For one thing, the average sperm concentration in the participants was fairly low.   “Strengths of the study are its large size, its use of cutting-edge estimates of air pollution and WHO semen analysis methods,” she said in an email.   Semen quality is significantly related to fertility; men with no (or very few) moving sperm cannot fertilize an egg, she noted.  "
2BekgWm,2017-12-11,Commuters often exposed to damaging noise levels," (Reuters Health) - Loud noise exceeding levels that can damage hearing is regularly encountered by commuters using buses, subways and even biking, a Canadian study suggests.    “The effects of noise on our hearing health and overall health has been garnering a lot of recent attention and our team recently commented that commuting in the city, in general, seems to be quite noisy, so we decided to take our noise dosimeters on common commuting routes to see exactly how loud things got,” senior study author Dr. Vincent Lin told Reuters Health by email.   “Those short bursts of sudden noise, if exposed to repeatedly and over a long period of time, may lead to permanent hearing loss,” said Lin, a researcher with the University of Toronto and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.   Although average noise levels measured on commutes around Toronto were within the recommended levels of safe exposure most of the time, bursts of loud noise on both public and private modes of transportation could still place individuals at risk of noise-induced hearing loss, Lin’s team writes in the Journal of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery.   The World Health Organization estimates that more than 360 million people live with disabling hearing loss and about 16 percent of that damage is the result of noise-induced hearing loss, the authors note.   Many standards for safe noise exposure have been established, Lin said. The WHO/EPA recommends no more than 15 minutes if the sound is louder than 90 decibels (dB). For sounds around 75 dB, then up to eight hours of exposure is acceptable.   To measure noise exposure for users of the Toronto transit system, the researchers used small devices called noise dosimeters attached to their shirt collars, about 2 inches (5.08 cm) away from their ears. The devices measure sound levels in so-called A-weighted decibels (dBA), reflecting the actual sound level “weighted” to account for the human ear’s sensitivity to different frequencies.    The study team collected measurements between April and August 2016, inside vehicles and outside or on boarding platforms, for several forms of private and public transportation - subways, buses, streetcars, private automobiles and biking or walking.   They found that average noise level was greater inside subway cars, at about 77 dBA and buses, at about 80 dBA, than inside the streetcar, where it was about 72 dBA. Average noise levels in waiting and boarding areas were higher still, at about 81 dBA for the subway platform and 80 dBA for buses and streetcars.     When the researchers examined how the loudest, or “peak,” noises compared to the EPA thresholds for safe exposure, they found that about 20 percent of the peak noises measured on the subway were greater than the EPA limit of 114 dBA for 4 seconds, and 20 percent of the loudest noises inside streetcars were greater than the EPA limit of 120 dBA for 1 second.    About 85 percent of peak noise measurements taken from bus platforms were greater than 114 dBA, and over half were greater than 120 dBA. All peak noise exposures while riding a bike exceeded 117 dBA, the EPA limit for 2 seconds of exposure, and 85 percent were greater than 120 dBA.    When the authors estimated exposure for an average Toronto commuter who uses public transportation for about 47 minutes, they calculated that 9 percent of the subway noise exposure, 12 percent of bus exposure and 14 percent of biking exposure exceed recommended thresholds.     “I like the study because it points out that we are living in a noisy environment and that constant exposure to high sound levels occurs and has the potential to accumulate and finally lead to damage of the ear and subsequent hearing loss,” said Dr. Claus-Peter Richter, an otolaryngologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study.    Richter suggests having earplugs handy. “Better earplugs run on the order of 12 dollars and should be always either in your ears if it is loud or in your pocket in a case,” he said by email.   “Personally, I  wear hearing protection in the movies because of loud peak sound levels. Earplugs reduce your sound levels by about 20 dB and put you in a safe position,” he said.  "
2BUpwxW,2017-12-11,"Kids continue to die in window-blind accidents, despite safety warnings"," (Reuters Health) - Even though window coverings have been recognized for decades as a safety hazard to children, injuries from blinds and shades still send many kids to the emergency room each year, a U.S. study suggests.    Almost 17,000 children under age 6 were treated for injuries from window blinds in U.S. emergency departments from 1990 to 2015, researchers report online December 11 in Pediatrics. That translates to an injury rate of almost 3 out of every 100,000 kids.    Most of the time, the injuries weren’t serious. But there were 228 cases when young children caught their necks in cords and two-thirds of these injuries were fatal.    While the majority of children were treated and released, there was still about one child death each month - most from strangulation when a child became entangled by the neck in a window blind cord.   “The findings of this study confirm that children continue to die from strangulation on window blind cords,” said senior author Dr. Gary Smith, director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. “This is unacceptable.”    “We’ve known about this problem since the 1940s,” Smith said by email. “We have had a voluntary safety standard in this country since the mid-1990s and we’ve had product recalls, and yet we continue to see these deaths.”   The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission approved a petition to develop mandatory safety standards for window coverings in 2014, Smith said. Unlike current voluntary standards designed to reduce the risk of strangulation, the proposed mandatory standards would require all window coverings to be cordless or have cords that are inaccessible to children.    “Cordless technologies are available for most blinds and shades and add little cost to manufacturing,” Smith said. “What we need now is for manufacturers to simply eliminate accessible cords in their products so that children can’t gain access to them.”   Almost two-thirds of the injuries children in the study sustained were head injuries, most often cuts, contusions and abrasions.    In almost half of the cases, the blinds struck kids, and cuts were the next most common mechanism of injury. Overall, about 12 percent of cases involved kids getting entangled in cords.    The majority of the cases occurred when parents were home with kids, but adults witnessed very few of the injuries. Often children were put to sleep, playing or watching television when injuries occurred.    When kids were alone, they often were unsupervised for less than 10 minutes before they got hurt.    One limitation of the study is that it only includes cases treated at hospitals and may underestimate the true injury rate associated with window coverings, the authors note. Researchers also lacked detailed information on the exact types of blinds involved in strangulation cases.    Even so, the findings suggest that voluntary safety standards aren’t enough to prevent serious injuries, said Dr. Sean Bandzar, an emergency medicine researcher at New York Presbyterian Hospital who wasn’t involved in the study.    This means parents need to be vigilant.   “The majority of injuries in this study occurred while children were under the care of parents with the children placed to sleep or playing,” Bandzar said by email. “Better parental supervision should be encouraged.”   Aiming baby monitors or cameras at blinds should help parents keep an eye on kids near windows at night or other times when they’re not in the room, he suggested.    If replacing blinds with dangling cords isn’t feasible or affordable, parents should focus their efforts on the rooms where kids spend the most time, like bedrooms or living rooms, Smith advised. Moving furniture away from windows so kids don’t have an easy way to climb and reach blinds can also help.    Child safety kits designed to keep blinds out of reach don’t always prevent kids from getting injured, he added.   “Some of the fixes can provide a false sense of security,” Smith said. “The best way to keep your children safe is to replace all blinds that have cords with either cordless blinds, blinds with inaccessible cords or other types of cordless window coverings, such as interior window shutters.”  "
2BXM55F,2017-12-08,Acupressure app may help ease menstrual cramp pain," (Reuters Health) - Women with intense menstrual cramp pain may get more relief from smartphone app-guided acupressure than with typical medical treatments like painkillers, a recent study suggests.    Some previous research has linked acupressure - which uses precise finger placements at pressure points throughout the body to relieve pain - with reduced discomfort from menstrual cramps. To see if a smartphone app could help women self-administer acupressure for cramps, researchers randomly assigned 221 women to use the app or to stick with usual care for six months.    By the end of the study, women who used the acupressure app reported significantly less menstrual pain than women who didn’t, the study found.    “Because women with menstrual pain already practice self-management, an app for acupressure can be easily added,” said senior study author Dr. Claudia Witt of the Institute for Complementary and Integrative Medicine at the University of Zurich in Switzerland.   “It is wise to try first non-pharmacological interventions, with a good safety profile, before using a painkiller that can have side effects,” Witt said by email.    The target audience for the app, young women in their 20s and 30s, already use their phones for a variety of different tasks, making it natural for them to consider an app that teaches them how to use pressure points to ease menstrual pain, researchers note in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology.    Witt’s team developed their own app, called AKUD, based on a consensus of acupressure experts from China, Germany and the U.S. For the current study, the researchers offered the app to women ages 18 to 34 in Berlin between 2012 and 2015.    All of the women reported their own pain levels for menstrual cramps on a scale of zero to 10, with 10 being the worst. At the start of the study, women reported pain of at least 6 on this scale.    Each participant was given an app to use for six months, but only half of the women had an app with an acupressure program. The rest had a “sham” app that didn’t offer any new ways of treating pain from cramps.    By the time women in the study went through their third menstrual cycle, participants using the acupressure app reported average pain scores of 4.4, compared with 5.0 for the other women in the study.    By the sixth menstrual cycle, women with the acupressure app reported pain scores that were typically 1.4 points lower, a large enough gap to represent a clinically meaningful difference.    With acupressure, women were also less likely to use pain medications and reported fewer days with pain during their monthly menstrual cycles, the researchers also found.    One limitation of the study is that most of the participants were highly educated and prone to intense menstrual cramps, which means the results might not represent what would happen for all women experiencing menstrual pain, the authors note.    Even so, the results suggest that an acupressure app may offer some women a good approach to managing menstrual pain, said Caroline Smith, an acupressure researcher at Western Sydney University in Australia who wasn’t involved in the study but who is developing a mass-distribution app for this purpose.     “Adherence suggests the app was acceptable, and the reduction in pain over time was clinically meaningful with few side effects,” Smith said by email. “This app is relevant to women who are looking for evidenced-based self-care options to manage their pain, although as the authors point out further research to address a more generalizable group of women is needed.”  "
2kavwvg,2017-12-08,Kids who get moving may also get better grades," (Reuters Health) - Students who get extra physical activity may pay more attention in school and do better in subjects like reading and math, a research review suggests.    The study team analyzed data from 26 previously published studies with a total of more than 10,000 children between 4 and 13 years old. All of the prior studies measured the impact of a variety of physical activity programs on academic performance.    The authors also looked at whether the effect of exercise differed across academic subjects. Although the benefit of physical activity was strongest for mathematics, it was only slightly smaller for other subjects like language and reading, meaning that physical activity benefits learning in all academic subjects.   “Exercise influences the brain by increasing cerebral blood flow, which increases the supply of oxygen and nutrients and promotes blood capillaries formation, increases the neuronal connectivity through the promotion of the synaptogenesis and the availability of neurotransmitters,” said study coauthor Ivan Cavero Redondo of Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha in Cuenca, Spain.    “Beyond the neurobiological explanations, exercise includes an important social component that fosters its benefits on mental health,” Redondo said by email.   At a time when many schools struggle to set aside time for gym classes amid a push to raise test scores by devoting more time to academics, the findings offer fresh evidence that physical activity is one way to help boost kids’ grades.    When kids take time out of the school day for physical activity, whether in dedicated gym classes or by incorporating movement into classroom lessons, students may have an easier time focusing on their classwork and do better in school, Redondo said.    Overall, physical activity appeared to have the biggest impact on keeping kids on task and focused on their work, the study found. Students who participated in various experimental exercise programs also did better at math, reading and language lessons than their peers who didn’t participate in these programs.    Exercise had a bigger impact on school performance when it was incorporated into the school day than when it was added as an extracurricular activity, researchers report in Pediatrics.    The experimental exercise programs tested in the smaller studies increased physical activity time from 10 minutes to 60 minutes per day.    Sometimes these programs expanded recess, while in other instances the added activity was achieved with after-school sports or creating active breaks between lessons during the school day.    One limitation of the study was that researchers lacked enough data from a large enough group of participants to determine which types of physical activity interventions might have the biggest impact on academics and school achievement, the authors note.    Even so, the analysis offers convincing evidence that physical activity can enhance children’s reading and math skills, said Sara Benjamin Neelon, a researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Schools need to get on board and prioritize active time for children both during and after the school day,” Benjamin Neelon said by email. “Kids spend a large portion of their waking hours at school and should spend at least part of that time being physically active.”   Physical activity may help kids do better in school by improving behavior, memory and cognitive function, said Jordan Carlson, a researcher at Children’s Mercy Kansas City who wasn’t involved in the study.    “A substantial amount of evidence shows that physical activity improves kids’ attention and behavior in the classroom and reduces classroom disruptions,” Carlson said by email. “Kids have an internal drive to be physically active, and inhibiting their need to be physically active during school can lead to behavioral problems.”   Because kids often get too little exercise time during the school day, parents need to provide these opportunities outside of school, Carlson added.    “However, the beneficial effect of physical activity on academic achievement appears to be specific to school-based physical activity,” Carlson said. “Parents should talk with their children, teachers, and administrators about opportunities for physical activity at school.”  "
2yOMkk4,2017-12-08,Depression in late teens linked to high school drop out," (Reuters Health) - Older teens struggling with depression are more than twice as likely to drop out of high school as peers without that mental illness or those who recovered from a bout of depression earlier in life, Canadian researchers say.    Understanding that current or recent depression raises dropout risk may encourage schools to put a higher priority on mental health services, the study team writes in the Journal of Adolescent Health.   “This is the first study of its kind to look at depression symptoms in the year before dropout,” lead author Dr. Veronique Dupere, associate professor at the school of psycho-education at the University of Montreal, told Reuters Health by phone.    “The role of depression in deciding to drop out was underestimated in previous studies because the timing was not properly considered. Depression is not stable. It tends to come and go,” she said.     For the new analysis, researchers asked 6,773 students in 12 disadvantaged high schools with high dropout rates in and around Montreal to complete a screening questionnaire at the beginning of the school year. The brief assessment, conducted from 2012 to 2015, measured students’ risk for dropout, and also asked for their sociodemographic information and their family’s employment, education and structure.    During a second round of interviews one year later, a subset of students were asked to participate in face-to-face meetings with a graduate student who assessed their mental health.    Students who dropped out of school in the year following their initial screening were also assessed for their mental health. Researchers compared these students to a similar group, also in the program, who didn’t drop out.   Almost a quarter of the 183 adolescents who dropped out of school had clinically significant depression in the few months before quitting, researchers found.    Dupere said rates of conduct disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were higher among the dropouts and the matched at-risk peers than among the average students. But ADHD was not a factor significantly distinguishing dropouts and matched at-risk students, although conduct disorder might be.    In 2015, an estimated three million adolescents aged 12 to 17 in the U.S. had experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For many individuals, major depression can end up limiting their ability to carry out major life activities.   “School dropout portends other bad outcomes, like the inability to gain employment, involvement in substance abuse and problems with the juvenile justice system,” said Dr. Laura Mufson of Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, who wasn’t involved in the study.   More than one in eight young people ages 16 to 24 are neither working nor in school, according to the Social Science Research Council’s Measure of America project. That estimate is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey.   “I’m excited about the study because we need data like this,” Dr. Tamar Mendelson of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland, told Reuters Health by phone.    “I think the problem of school dropout is really critical,” said Mendelson, who wasn’t involved in the new study. “Depression and other mental health issues can sometimes fall through the cracks. Administrators may not understand all the issues and the best course to take. Data like this is helpful in highlighting the risks associated between depression and school dropout.”     One limitation of the study is that a lot of teenagers have anxiety along with depression, Mufson noted.    “The researchers looked at ADHD and conduct disorders. They left out anxiety and it’s highly linked to school dropout,” she said in a phone interview.   Dupere emphasized that no cause-and-effect conclusions can be drawn from her research. “I believe studies like the one we did should be replicated in other places, as well, to see if the results are the same.”   "
2mEXRyo,2017-12-08,"Credibility, recipes, references help food blogs improve eating habits"," (Reuters Health) - Consumers like healthy eating blogs written by nutritionists who seem credible and who interact with their readers, a small study in Canada suggests.   The researchers looked at what properties of a food blog are most likely to encourage readers to make healthy changes in eating behavior. They also found that references and links to extra information boosted both credibility and usefulness.    “Health professionals and laypersons alike frequently enlist blogs as way to provide dietary advice or to tell their story. But the internet is a vortex for conflicting - and oftentimes wildly inaccurate - information, especially when it comes to a healthy diet,” said New Jersey-based independent nutritionist Felicia Stoler, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Blogs can provide a great reference for inspiration and motivation,” said Stoler, who holds a doctorate in clinical nutrition from Rutgers University. “But you need to look for credible sources. Preferably a registered dietician. It’s not uncommon for physicians, chiropractors and chefs to position themselves as nutritionists. Unfortunately, these folks don’t necessarily have the adequate background or training to properly advise individuals on their diet.”    Sophie Desroches of the Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods at Laval University in Quebec City and her colleagues recruited a group of women to assess four healthy-eating blogs written by French Canadian registered dieticians.    The thirty-three participants answered questions and provided feedback on the usefulness and ease of use of each of the blogs.    Desroches, who didn’t respond to a request for comments, and her colleagues found that certain types of content and design features in a blog got the highest scores for usefulness. Of these, recipes, hyperlinks and references were the most important.   Hyperlinks provided an easier way to direct readers to additional resources while references, including blogger bios, improved the users’ feeling that the blogger is a credible source, according to the results in Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.   The study participants also assumed that featured recipes were nutritionally sound, which in turn made them more inclined to incorporate those recipes into their own diets.    Interaction between bloggers and blog readers enhanced ease of use and facilitated a sense of connection between content creators and readers, the researchers also found. That connection made readers more likely to move toward improving their dietary behaviors.     One of the surprising findings, the study team notes, was that users preferred a narrative approach to food-related personal experiences over and above straight expert advice - as long as the storytelling was coming from a credible source.    Many users found that videos weren’t relevant unless they featured specific cooking techniques, and on average, women felt videos were much too long. The users did tend to like vibrant colors, eye-catching photos and text that was well organized with subheadings.   The researchers acknowledge in their report that they studied just a small sampling of the healthy eating blogs on the internet, and that their group of assessors may not represent all French Canadian users.   Stoler advises readers of healthy eating blogs to maintain a degree of skepticism and ask themselves certain questions. Might this blogger be getting paid to promote a certain agenda? Is he or she disclosing any conflicts of interest? Does the blogger have any bias in favor of whatever they’re promoting?   "
2BOsgOd,2017-12-07,Open windows and doors can improve sleep quality," (Reuters Health) - Leaving a bedroom door or window open may help people sleep better, a study from the Netherlands suggests.   Open windows and doors helped reduce carbon dioxide levels and improve ventilation and air flow, which was related to better sleep quality for the healthy young adults in the study.    “We spend nearly a third of our life in the bedroom environment, but the air quality in our sleeping environment is often overlooked,” said study author Dr. Asit Mishra of Eindhoven University of Technology.   “Imagine this - you are in a confined space and have limited ability to adjust the situation (since you are asleep) while you are possibly surrounded by pollutants,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “This is how things are in bed, covered under duvets or a blanket.”   For one night of the study, 17 volunteers slept with an open window or internal door. On another night, the windows and door to the room were kept closed. In the meantime, Mishra and colleagues monitored carbon dioxide levels, temperature, background noise and humidity. The study participants were asked not to drink alcoholic beverages or caffeinated drinks, which could influence sleep. They each slept alone, and the bedroom layout with furniture arrangement was kept consistent.    For measuring sleep quality, participants wore an armband that measures skin temperature, heat flux, bed temperature and skin moisture levels. They also wore a sensor that tracked their movements at night, including indications of restlessness.    Closed environments tended to have less background noise – but they also had significantly higher carbon dioxide levels, which indicated lower ventilation levels.    Open conditions were slightly cooler than closed, although humidity levels were similar across settings, according to the report in the journal Indoor Air.   Notably, carbon dioxide levels were lower when windows or doors were open.   Overall, skin temperature and the bed temperature were higher in closed conditions than open conditions. The number of awakenings and sleep efficiency improved as carbon dioxide levels decreased.   “Opening an internal door can be a reasonably good alternative if you don’t want to open windows, either for noise concerns or security concerns,” Mishra said.    A limitation of the study is that the motion sensor often slipped off the sleepers at night.    “Sleep quality is affected by many factors, such as health and emotional states, bedding conditions and different environmental conditions, including noise levels and temperature,” said Dr. Nuno Canha of the University of Lisbon in Portugal. Canha, who wasn’t involved with this study, researches indoor air quality and sleep during different ventilation patterns. He is also part of LIFE Index-Air, a European research group that focuses on human exposure to pollutants.   In a recent study, Canha and colleagues found that closed doors and windows led to higher levels of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other substances such as formaldehyde.   “Sleep is essential to our life in several areas: health, well-being and productivity,” Canha told Reuters Health by email. “The exposure we are under while asleep is continuous . . . and we should play it safe in order to breathe better air during sleep.”  "
2iBHgXp,2017-12-07,Childhood cancer survivors have more blood pressure problems," (Reuters Health) - More than one in 12 adult survivors of childhood cancers may have undiagnosed high blood pressure, a U.S. study suggests.   High blood pressure, or hypertension, can be a particular problem for childhood cancer survivors because many of them have heart damage as a result of chemotherapy and radiation treatments.    Even when they do get diagnosed with high blood pressure, more than one in five of these patients don’t take medication or make lifestyle changes necessary to treat it, the study also found.    “It is notable that survivors in our study had a higher-than-expected prevalence of hypertension regardless of their specific childhood cancer diagnosis or treatment,” said lead study author Todd Gibson of St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.    “The good news is that, unlike prior cancer therapy, high blood pressure is a modifiable risk factor,” Gibson said by email.    Previous research has linked cancer drugs known as anthracyclines to weakening of the heart muscle. Research has also tied some radiation therapy to cardiac rhythm disorders and structural damage in arteries and valves.   As a growing number of childhood cancer patients survive well into adulthood, more of them are living long enough to develop hypertension and other chronic health problems that often come with age.    Cardiovascular disease is the second most common cause of death and serious illness for these cancer survivors, second only to malignancies, researchers note in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.    Deaths from cardiovascular disease are eight times more likely in childhood cancer survivors than in people without a history of tumors early in life. Serious events like heart attacks are five times more likely among cancer survivors than among their siblings who never had malignancies.    The current analysis involved 3,016 adults who were part of the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study. All had been treated for cancer as kids and survived at least 10 years.    By age 30, 13 percent of them had high blood pressure, the study found. By comparison, the general prevalence of hypertension among 18-to-39-year-olds in the U.S. is about 7 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).   The proportion of childhood cancer survivors with hypertension climbed to 37 percent by age 40 and exceeded 70 percent by age 50. In the general U.S. population, according to the CDC, only about 30 percent of people ages 40 to 60 have hypertension.    Certain groups were most likely to have hypertension: men; non-Hispanic blacks, older survivors, and those who were overweight or obese, the study found.   Exposure to chemotherapy or radiation didn’t appear to influence whether cancer survivors developed high blood pressure.    One limitation of the study is that researchers only had blood pressure measurements from a single visit at each point in time, making it possible that some patients may have been misclassified. Some patients get anxious and develop temporary high blood pressure during checkups.    It’s also possible that the findings might not apply to other cancer survivors because the participants received frequent follow-up care that not all survivors might get, the researchers point out.    Even so, the findings suggest that cancer survivors need regular blood pressure checkups, said Dr. Daniel Lenihan, a researcher at Washington University in St. Louis who wasn’t involved in the study.    “A young adult in their 30s or 40s does not think about screening for hypertension very often,” Lenihan said by email. “A cancer survivor needs to consider this issue early in adulthood because their rate of hypertension is very high and starts at a very early age.”  "
2iBGny7,2017-12-07,Gum infections tied to increased risk of stomach cancer precursor," (Reuters Health) - Gum infections may increase people’s risk for sores in the digestive tract that can lead to stomach cancer, a small study suggests.    Researchers focused on what’s known as periodontal disease, serious infections in the mouth caused by bacteria in dental plaque. Daily brushing and flossing can prevent gingivitis, the milder form of periodontal disease, but untreated cases can lead to permanent damage to the gums and bone.   The new study involved 35 people with so-called precancerous lesions: abnormal cells or sores in the digestive tract where cancer is more likely to occur compared to normal tissue. The researchers also studied a control group of 70 similar people who didn’t have these lesions.    Overall, 32 percent of people with precancerous gastric lesions had the kind of bleeding during dental exams that is a hallmark of periodontal disease, compared with 22 percent of individuals without precancerous lesions, the study found.    People with gastric precancerous lesions were also more likely to have high levels of several types of bacteria in their mouths that can contribute to periodontal disease.   “These bacteria are commonly found in periodontal pockets and are invasive because they can produce a variety of molecules that can cause damage to host tissue as well as host responses to bacterial colonization, therefore contributing to cancer development,” said senior study author Yihong Li, a researcher at the New York University College of Dentistry in New York City.    “The periodontal pockets are not easy accessible by a regular toothbrush and could serve as a reservoir of bacterial colonization and potentially a source of chronic inflammation and carcinogenic bacterial (growth),” Li said by email.    Many cases of gastric cancer are linked to smoking and eating foods with a lot of salt or preservatives, researchers note in their report in the Journal of Periodontology. Poor oral health has also been tied to these tumors.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how oral health problems might contribute to stomach cancer, the researchers note. Precancerous lesions also don’t always develop into cancer.    Even so, the findings add to the evidence that periodontal disease may play a role in the development of stomach cancer, said Jean Wactawski-Wende, a researcher at the University at Buffalo who wasn’t involved in the study.    Inflammation may play a role, Wactawski-Wende said by email. Periodontal disease may cause inflammation in the mouth and also contribute to inflammation throughout the body. Some bacteria from the mouth might also travel from the mouth to the gastrointestinal track.   “This study is small and not able to prove causation; however, there is growing evidence that periodontal disease may be associated with certain types of cancer, including GI cancer,” Wactawski-Wende added. “Maintaining good oral hygiene through teeth brushing and flossing and seeing a dentist regularly may be prudent.”  "
2AAADNh,2017-12-07,Faulty positioning in rugby tackles boosts injury risk," (Reuters Health) - Head, neck and shoulder injuries during rugby tackles are more common when the tackler’s head is incorrectly positioned in relation to the ball carrier, a small study has found.                    FILE PHOTO - Rugby Union - England Training - Pennyhill Park, Bagshot, Britain - November 21, 2017   England's Semesa Rokoduguni makes a tackle during training   Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge      Japanese researchers randomly selected 28 game videos featuring two university teams and evaluated a total of 3,970 tackles. In about 10 percent of the tackles, the tackler’s head was incorrectly positioned in front of the ball carrier.    World Rugby, the sport’s governing body, says the tackler must be positioned behind or to one side of the ball carrier.    “When we did our own comprehensive head injury study in late 2016, the specialist working group identified technique as a key focus area, and the tackle law amendment in January was aimed at adjusting the technique of the tackler to remove the player from the area of greatest risk,” a World Rugby spokesperson told Reuters Health by email.   Evidence from the 2016 study showed that 76 percent of all head injuries occur in the tackle, and the risk of injury for the tackler is more than two and a half times greater than for the ball-carrier, with tackle height a contributing factor.    In the current study, the incidence of injury was 69.4 per 1,000 tackles when head positioning was incorrect, falling to 2.7 per 1,000 tackles with correct positioning, Dr. Takayuki Kawasaki of the Juntendo University Faculty of Medicine in Bunkyo, Tokyo, and colleagues found.    Injuries were more common when tackles were of shorter duration and when there was shorter distance covered before contact, the researchers wrote in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.    “This particular study supports our evidence-based position that the promotion of correct technique in the tackle has a significant injury-prevention benefits,” the World Rugby spokesperson said.    Despite several interventions to address concussions, neck injuries, pinched nerves and shoulder injuries that commonly result from rugby tackles, including changes in technique and exercises aimed at reducing injury, no formal prevention strategy is in place, the researchers noted.    As part of the study, players who tackled with incorrect head positioning completed a questionnaire, after watching a video of the tackle within a week following the match. Responses showed that in nearly 14 percent of incorrect tackles analyzed, the head positioning was intentional, and 61 percent of players said they could avoid tackling with incorrect positioning.    “With correct coaching and technique, the wide-ranging benefits of involvement in the sport far outweigh the risks,” said Dr. Ian Gibbons, a senior house officer at Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, who played rugby from age four through medical school.    “This study looked at university rugby, where a lot of people may not have had the foundations of sound basic tackling technique from a young age. University rugby can be quite disorganized with extremely variable levels of coaching quality . . . so these are a section of players who would be vulnerable to tackling injuries,” Gibbons, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.    The researchers acknowledge that their small study’s results may not be generalizable to all rugby players. Disparities in the teams’ levels, tactics and coaching methods could also impact the incidence of injury, they added.    Gibbons noted that while players in the UK play in age categories, in New Zealand they are divided into weight categories. “Matching players of the same weight/size at a young age could help ensure a good technique is mastered,” he said.   "
2BPPfIA,2017-12-06,Knee surgery outcomes linked with education level," (Reuters Health) - Patients who live in low-income communities and lack a college education may have worse pain after knee replacement surgery than their more educated neighbors, a recent study suggests.    Two years after total knee replacement surgeries, patients in poor communities who hadn’t gone to college had average pain scores that were about 10 points worse than patients in the same neighborhood who had some college education, the study found.    In wealthy communities, however, the difference in pain scores with and without college was only 1 point.   “Poorer outcomes were seen with a larger ‘dose’ of community poverty,” said lead study author Dr. Susan M Goodman of the Hospital for Special Surgery and Weill Cornell Medical School in New York City.    “When we looked at the interaction with education, we found that some college education was protective,” Goodman said by email. “Even for those from poor communities, outcomes were far better for the educated.”   It’s possible that people without college education had delays in seeking treatment that contributed to worse pain and function before they even had surgery, Goodman said. A lack of college education might also contribute to lower levels of health literacy, making it harder for patients to understand and stick with complex medical regimens after surgery, including intensive rehabilitation exercises.    The study involved 3,790 patients who had total knee replacement surgeries, including 2,438 people with at least some college education. In addition to focusing on pain and disability after the operations, the researchers also looked at education levels for each patient as well as community-level income information based on records from the U.S. census.    Patients with no college in the study were about 68 years old on average compared to about 67 for people with at least some college. They were also more likely to be female, Hispanic, obese, and have at least one complex medical condition in addition to their knee issues.    Many patients without any college lived in poor neighborhoods and in communities where a college education was less common.    There wasn’t a meaningful association between pain levels and the overall level of education in the community, researchers reported in Arthritis Care and Research.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how education levels might influence the impact of poverty on knee surgery outcomes.    Another limitation of the study is that it included a relatively small proportion of patients from poor neighborhoods, which may have made it harder to detect meaningful differences in surgery outcomes that might have been apparent in a larger group.    Knee surgery outcomes are also highly dependent on pain and function levels before the operation, noted Dr. Tomas Sveikata, a surgeon at Republican Vilnius University Hospital in Lithuania.    “If the surgery is done in the earlier stage of the disease, the final result will be better,” Sveikata, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Sometimes patients come in very late stages of the disease with big deformities and very poor function. Then it’s impossible to achieve (an) excellent postoperative result.”   Even so, the results suggest that clinicians need to consider patients’ education levels when communicating with them about follow-up care, said Leigh Callahan, associate director of the Thurston Arthritis Research Center at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.   “Individuals with more education living in communities with higher levels of poverty might have better outcomes than individuals with less education living in those communities because more education may help someone communicate with the health care team better about follow-up care,” Callahan, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.     “People should not be afraid to tell their physicians, nurses, physical therapists or any other providers that they are not being clear as to what they are to do when they are rehabilitating,” Callahan added.

2jUGTHR,2017-12-06,Study confirms higher breast cancer risk with hormone-based contraception," (Reuters Health) - Women who currently use or recently used hormone-based contraception face a 20 percent higher risk of breast cancer, although the overall risk for most women is relatively low, a new study of 1.8 million women in Denmark has concluded.   Older contraceptives were known to carry a higher risk of breast cancer, but doctors had hoped that the newer lower-estrogen formulations might pose a lower risk.   The new findings, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, show that they do not, and the longer the products were used, the greater the danger.   The researchers calculated that hormone contraception produced one extra case of breast cancer for every 7,690 women each year. That’s a lot of cancers, given that 140 million use hormonal contraception worldwide – or about 13 percent of women ages 15 to 49.   Breast cancer strikes about 255,000 U.S. women each year and kills about 41,000, according to the American Cancer Society.   The study shows that “the search for an oral contraceptive that does not elevate the risk of breast cancer needs to continue,” said Dr. David Hunter of the University of Oxford in a Journal editorial.    Beyond the fact that they provide an effective means of contraception and may benefit women with menstrual cramping or abnormal menstrual bleeding, “the use of oral contraceptives is associated with substantial reductions in the risks of ovarian, endometrial, and colorectal cancers later in life. Indeed, some calculations have suggested that the net effect of the use of oral contraceptives for 5 years or longer is a slight reduction in the total risk of cancer,” Hunter said.   But as women get into their 40s, non-hormonal alternatives such as IUDs might be better, he said. Most cases of breast cancer were seen in women using oral contraceptives in their 40s.   “I don’t think anyone’s going to say stop taking oral contraceptives. That’s not necessary and not supported by the data,” said Dr. Roshni Rao, chief of breast surgery at New York - Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, who was not involved with the study. “But it does show an increased risk, so for people who don’t have a great reason for taking oral contraceptives, or are amenable to alternatives, perhaps they should think about it.”   Such alternatives include a copper IUD, condoms or, if women are done having children, tubal ligation.   The new study looked at all women in Denmark ages 15 to 49 who had not had cancer, clots in their veins, or treatment for infertility. The women were followed for nearly 11 years.   The 20 percent increase in breast cancer risk varied by age and how long the women used hormone-based contraceptives, including pills, contraceptive patches, vaginal rings, progestin-only implants, and injections.   The risk was 9 percent higher with less than one year of use and 38 percent higher with more than 10 years of use.   “Another thing that has not been clear before is that after discontinuation, if you have used this product for more than 5 years, the risk seems to be increased, even after 5 years of discontinuation of the drugs,” chief author Dr. Lina Morch, a senior researcher at Copenhagen University Hospital told Reuters Health by phone.   On the other hand, among women who used hormonal contraceptives for short periods, the excess risk of breast cancer disappeared rapidly after use was stopped, the researchers said.   IUDs infused with hormones also appear to pose a risk, Morch said, so “so there’s a lot of things to take into account when deciding what type of contraception to use. Contraception itself is a benefit, of course, but this study indicates it might be worth considering an alternative to hormone contraception, like the copper intrauterine device or barrier methods like condoms.”   “If you compare this to other risks, such as obesity and being overweight, there’s more of a risk with obesity than if you take a few years of oral contraceptives,” Rao told Reuters Health by phone.   “There’s no need to panic based on these results,” said Morch, “We don’t want women dropping their contraception without having something different to go to. And there are alternatives.”  "
2AuxnET,2017-12-05,Women get mixed messages about sexuality after childbirth," (Reuters Health) - Women receive mixed messages about the ways giving birth may affect their sex lives, according to a new report.   Although studies don’t show a difference between post-delivery effects for vaginal births versus C-sections, media messages - especially dramatic reality TV shows - may lead women to be more fearful of what vaginal delivery might do to their sexuality, researchers wrote in the journal Birth.   Popular TV shows tend to portray vaginal births as negative and C-sections as positive for post-birth sex life concerns such as vaginal stretching or tearing, said study coauthor Dr. Caroline Pukall of Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada.    According to the National Institutes of Health, however, research hasn’t shown any differences in sexuality after childbirth based on the mode of delivery.   “Sexuality is an important aspect of many people’s lives and may be something that they consider when thinking about their birth plan,” Pukall told Reuters Health by email. “Some people may be influenced by media sources when making this decision.”   Pukall and coauthor Jaclyn Cappell surveyed more than 1,400 women who had never been pregnant but were interested in giving birth. The researchers asked about the women’s preferences for delivery, their perceptions about childbirth related to sexuality, and about the influence of various sources of information about childbirth – for example, relatives, friends, health care providers, magazines, television, the internet, etc.   They found that 85 percent of the women preferred a vaginal birth. At the same time, 48 percent agreed with the statement, “My vagina will be ‘loose’ after I have a vaginal birth,” and 16 percent agreed with the statement, “My partner will not like the look of my vulva after I have a vaginal birth.”    In addition, 21 percent thought having a C-section would prevent future sex problems. Those who felt this way were more likely to say that reality media, nonreality media and online media were influential sources of information. Those who disagreed were more likely to see health care professionals as influential sources of information.   The goal of the study was to illuminate misperceptions that exist among women, Pukall said.   She added, “The results are crucial in stimulating important conversations for childbirth educators, clinicians, new parents and the general public.”   Beliefs may vary by geographic location and culture, too. According to a report this year in the journal Reproductive Health, for example, more women in the U.S., UK, Chile, New Zealand and Australia prefer C-sections compared to women in Germany and Iceland. The women who preferred C-sections were also more likely to fear childbirth.   “Women who learned about birth at school by watching videos had higher fear scores than those who learned through family or midwives,” said Dr. Kathrin Stoll of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, who published the Reproductive Health paper but wasn’t involved in Pukall’s research.   In Germany, for example, a program invites midwives to schools to talk about their jobs and how babies are born. They use hands-on teaching aids to show how babies sit in the pelvis and move through the birth canal.    “It’s important for us to discuss our fears openly and find solutions rather than read about it online or watch reality TV birthing shows,” Stoll told Reuters Health by phone.    “Don’t believe everything you hear and see in the media,” said Dr. Edwin van Teijlingen of the Centre for Midwifery, Maternal and Perinatal Health at Bournemouth University in England. Dr. van Teijlingen wasn’t involved with Pukall’s study.   People need “to be aware of more subtle ways we are influenced by portrayal of events in sitcoms, advertisements, blog posts, newsletters and more,” he told Reuters Health by email.  "
2AyqliH,2017-12-06,Home births in rural areas just as safe as in cities," (Reuters Health) - Home births may not be more dangerous for healthy rural mothers than for their urban counterparts, a recent U.S. study suggests.    The 18,723 pregnant women in the study all had a low risk of complications, were being cared for by midwives, and planned to deliver their babies at home or in birthing centers. Once researchers adjusted for patient characteristics that can influence birth outcomes for mothers and babies, they didn’t find the odds of complications any higher for rural than for urban women.    “With rural healthcare provider shortages, rural hospital closures, and greater travel distances, it could be expected that there would be an increased time to seek emergency backup care that would result in poorer outcomes,” said lead study author Elizabeth Nethery, a researcher at the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia.   “What we found instead is that rural women and their babies do not appear to have any added risks when planning a birth at home or in a birthing center compared with nonrural women,” Nethery said by email.    About 22 percent of women in the U.S. live in rural areas with very limited access to obstetric care, researchers note in Birth. Despite declines in hospital-based obstetric services, however, midwifery care at home and in freestanding birthing centers is available in many rural communities.    The current study is the first to look at risks for rural versus urban women who give birth at home or in freestanding birthing centers in the U.S., Nethery said.    Overall, about 95 percent of rural mothers and 94 percent of urban mothers in the study had a normal spontaneous vaginal delivery, the study found.    There wasn’t a meaningful difference in the proportion of women who had vaginal deliveries aided by instruments like forceps or a vacuum.    Almost 5 percent of urban mothers had surgical cesarean section deliveries, compared with less than 4 percent of rural mothers, a difference that was small but statistically meaningful.    In cities, women were also slightly more likely to have serious tearing during delivery or require a transfer to a hospital for more involved medical care. Babies were also more likely stay in the neonatal intensive care unit after urban births.    Limitations of the study include the reliance on women’s residential zip codes to decide whether they lived in an urban or rural area and to estimate how far they might need to travel to a hospital in an emergency, the authors note. In some cases this estimate might not be accurate.    The study was also too small to detect slight but clinically meaningful differences in the chances of rare neonatal complications, the authors note.    Even so, the findings should reassure women that a home birth or birthing center delivery doesn’t need to come with any extra risk of complications, as long as women are appropriately screened for any medical issues that would make a hospital delivery the safer choice, said Erin Wright, a midwife and researcher at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing in Baltimore who wasn’t involved in the study.    “There is a generalized myth about rural communities that tells us that often care is not at the standard in some areas as opposed to urban areas which tend to have a large number of teaching hospitals,” Wright said by email. “This study, specific to these conditions, dispels that myth.”  "
2zI9Ot8,2017-12-06,Kids aren’t protecting themselves against STDs during oral sex," (Reuters Health) - Adolescents and young adults regularly engage in oral sex but seldom use condoms to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, new research shows.   That didn’t surprise the researcher who headed the study. “Many studies show that adolescents and young adults are unaware of the health risks associated with oral sex,” said Giuseppina Valle Holway, a sociology professor at The University of Tampa in Florida, in an email.   As reported in the Journal of Adolescent Health, Holway and her coauthor Stephanie Hernandez examined reports of heterosexual oral sex and condom use in a nationally representative sample of more than 7,000 U.S. youth between ages 15 and 24. More than half reported engaging in fellatio within the past year, but only 8 percent of females and 9 percent of males said they used a condom.    “Many young adults do not perceive they are at risk of contracting a sexually transmitted infection,” said Erin Moore, a professor of human sexuality at Stetson University in DeLand, Florida, who was not involved with the study.    Oral sex is less likely to spread sexually transmitted infections than vaginal or anal intercourse, she said, but the risk remains.   “If people are not going to use condoms consistently, then the most important thing they should do is get tested for sexually transmitted infections and make sure their partners get tested before engaging in oral, vaginal or anal sex,” Moore said in an email.   Holway and Hernandez suggest that doctors discuss the potential for sexually transmitted infections with young patients. Interactive workshops about safe-sex practices on college campuses are also valuable education tools, the authors write.   Many American schools provide no sex education or just abstinence-only sex education, discouraging all sexual contact until marriage without teaching prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, Moore said.   “Keep in mind that, less than 20 years ago, some states still had ‘sodomy laws’ that made engaging in oral sex illegal,” Moore said. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled sodomy laws unconstitutional in a Texas case in 2003.   Though the main findings of the study were expected, results about race and maternal education sparked interest in additional research.   Black youth were less likely to engage in oral sex, the study found, but they were significantly more likely to use a condom. Previous studies have shown that black youth also are more likely to use condoms during intercourse, according to the report.   Females whose mothers had higher levels of education were more likely to have performed or received oral sex - and were more likely to have had two or more oral sex partners in the past year. The finding led researchers to speculate that “higher goals may lead young women to engage in oral sex in place of vaginal sex, particularly if they view intercourse as a riskier sexual activity with more severe consequences (e.g., pregnancy) that could derail future plans.”   Moore was intrigued by the researchers’ hypothesis that maternal education could be related to young women having a goal-oriented mindset that may lead to oral sex instead of vaginal sex.    “Previous research highlights that college students tend to be more concerned about experiencing pregnancy than contracting a sexually transmitted infection,” she said. “A child is viewed as a much more life-changing event.”   The study focused exclusively on condoms and fellatio and did not examine the recommended use of dental dams during cunnilingus. But prior research shows that people rarely, if ever, use dental dams.    Increasing the use of barrier methods during cunnilingus could help to decrease the rate of oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and possibly the incidence of HPV-related cancers. Roughly one in nine U.S. men have oral infections of cancer-causing HPV.    HPV is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Most infections don’t cause symptoms and go away on their own. But the virus can cause cancers of the throat, anus, penis, cervix, vagina and vulva, as well as genital warts and lesions in the upper respiratory tract.   Other STDs that can be passed on from oral sex include gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  "
2Avvk3L,2017-12-05,Eating almonds with chocolate may lower cholesterol," (Reuters Health) - Overweight and obese people who eat almonds and chocolate every day may have lower cholesterol than their counterparts who don’t consume these foods, a recent experiment suggests.    Consumed separately, almonds and chocolate have each been linked to lower blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol and hunger levels in previous studies. All of these things are risk factors for heart disease.   For the current study, researchers tested cholesterol levels in 31 overweight and obese people. For four weeks, all of them followed a typical American diet. Every day for another four weeks, they all added almost one-third of a cup of almonds to the typical diet. In another four-week period, participants added almost one-quarter cup of dark chocolate and about 2.5 tablespoons of cocoa powder per day. Everyone also had a four-week period of adding both the nuts and the dark chocolate with cocoa to their diet.    Adding just the almonds reduced participants’ levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol - the bad kind that can build up in blood vessels and lead to clots and heart attacks - by 7 percent, the study found.    Combining almonds with dark chocolate and cocoa also reduced small, dense LDL particles that are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, researchers report in the Journal of the American Heart Association.   “Almonds alone lowered LDL cholesterol levels and chocolate and cocoa did not, but they also did not increase LDL cholesterol levels, “said senior study author Penny Kris-Etherton, a nutrition researcher at Penn State University.   The results don’t mean it’s wise for people to eat almonds and chocolate by the pound, however.   “We do have about 270 discretionary calories that we can include in our diet, and I tell people to use their discretionary calories wisely,” Kris-Etherton said by email. That means having almonds and chocolate in moderation, and instead of other sweets and treats, not in addition to cookies, candy and desserts.    Participants in the experiment ranged in age from 30 to 70 years, and all of them were overweight or obese.    During the study, people got roughly half their calories from carbohydrates, about 16 percent from protein and about 33 to 36 percent from fat.    The exact amount of calories in meals and snacks was calibrated to each participant’s current weight and designed to help them maintain that weight during the study period.    The study was small, and it’s possible results would be different with a larger group of people.    Kris-Etherton and other authors received funding from the Hershey Company and from the Almond Board of California.    Even so, the findings add to existing evidence that nuts and cocoa have health benefits, said Samantha Heller, a registered dietician and author in New York City who wasn’t involved in the study. These foods can help fight inflammation, provide fiber and healthy fats, among other things.    But moderation is key, Heller said by email.    “Eating nuts and dark chocolate in place of other less healthy foods such as chips, fast food, commercial candy or cookies, in appropriate portions, along with an overall healthy lifestyle, may offer health benefits,” Heller said.   "
2zO09xb,2017-12-04,Court-mandated opioid rehab rarely meets medical standards," (Reuters Health) - Fewer than one in 20 people with opioid addiction problems who are ordered into rehab programs by the courts receive methadone or buprenorphine, two drugs doctors consider the best treatment option, a U.S. study suggests.    Only 4.6 percent of people referred to opioid treatment programs by U.S. courts received methadone or buprenorphine, compared with almost 41 percent of patients outside the criminal justice system, researchers note in Health Affairs.     This disparity sets court-mandated rehab patients up for failure, said lead study author Noa Krawczyk of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.    “A wide evidence base documents the effectiveness of medication treatment among justice-involved individuals in decreasing risk for overdose, reducing HIV and hepatitis C transmission, and improving criminal justice outcomes,” Krawczyk said by email.    What they’re getting instead – treatment focused only on abstinence with peer counseling or psychotherapy – is less effective, he said.    “This does not address the adaptation in the brain or body that has occurred as part of the opioid addiction,” Krawczyk added. “Indeed, there is a vast amount of evidence documenting the effectiveness of ongoing medication treatment over non-medication-based treatment on a range of outcomes, including better retention in care, reduced illicit opioid use, reduced overdose, reduced criminal justice involvement and overall better functioning.”   For the study, researchers examined 2014 data from drug treatment programs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. They focused only on adults in rehab for overuse of opioids, including heroin as well as nonprescription methadone.    Out of about 72,000 patients receiving opioid treatment, 24 percent had been referred through the criminal justice system, the study found.    When the courts ordered treatment, patients’ odds of getting medication were more than 90 percent lower than for people outside the criminal justice system.    The analysis only included clients receiving treatment for the first time, and it’s possible the odds of medication use might be different for people who are repeat rehab patients, the authors note.    The study also didn’t include data on buprenorphine prescribed by primary care providers outside a rehab setting, and researchers lacked data on patients’ health insurance status, which might have influenced the treatment options available to them.   Even so, the findings add to evidence that people in the criminal justice system receive substandard opioid addiction treatment, said Andrew Rosenblum, executive director of the National Development and Research Institutes (NDRI), a New York-based think tank.   While approaches like peer counseling and psychotherapy may help patients recover from addiction, they’re often not enough, Rosenblum said by email.   “Despite the advantages of psychotherapy such as strengthening insight, resolve, and coping, they may not be able to prevent drug craving and subsequent drug use,” Rosenblum added. “Patients who receive psychosocial treatment have higher relapse rates and are more likely to leave treatment than patients receiving agonist therapy.”   Including buprenorphine and methadone in treatment has been shown to increase the odds that patients stick with treatment and to reduce the odds that they will return to opioids in the future or die from an overdose, said Dr. Marc LaRochelle of  Boston Medical Center’s Grayken Center for Addiction, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “These medications have the strongest evidence base and should be a treatment option for all patients,” LaRochelle said by email.    “The most concerning finding of this study to me is that the source of referral for treatment is such an overwhelmingly strong predictor of what treatment is received,” LaRochelle added. “The choice of treatment should be up to the patient and their treatment providers – not criminal justice system practitioners or judges who have no medical training to support their influence on treatment.”  "
2AaHjUf,2017-12-01,Doctors rarely discuss end-of-life care for chronic lung conditions," (Reuters Health) - Though most people suffering from chronic respiratory diseases want to discuss their preferences for end-of-life care with medical providers, they seldom do, a new review of past research suggests.   “It’s easier to avoid the conversation, which is rarely a brief one,” said Dr. Cari Levy, a professor at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora. “Our systems are not designed to allow for meaningful conversations that may take some time.”   Levy, a palliative-care physician who routinely discusses end-of-life questions with her patients, believes that confronting death can be empowering.   “We should not fool ourselves that protecting them from these discussions is in their best interest because we don’t want them to lose hope,” Levy, who was not involved with the study, said in an email. “It’s hard to have hope when you’re mired in a cloud of anxiety. Clarity comes with control, and patients report feeling more control when they talk about dying and death.”   Lea Jabbarian, a public health researcher at Erasmus University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, led a team that searched electronic databases for research on advanced-care planning in adults with chronic respiratory diseases.    Ultimately, the researchers looked at data from 21 earlier studies involving nearly 2,000 patients with chronic lung diseases.    In one of the studies, 99 percent reported being interested in discussing end-of-life care preferences, Jabbarian and colleagues report in the journal Thorax.   In another study, focusing on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 68 percent of people reported being interested in engaging in conversations about the subject.   But when investigators asked chronic respiratory patients if they could recall discussions about end-of-life care with their healthcare providers, only 12 to 32 percent said they could. Similarly, when researchers asked healthcare professionals if they had engaged patients in such discussions, only 20 to 33 percent reported doing so.   “We see that both patients and healthcare professionals want to have these conversations, but they only happen quite rarely,” Jabbarian said in a Skype interview. “We need to provide the right training, the right environment to allow these conversations to happen.”   “It’s really not that easy, and that’s why the healthcare professionals need all the support to engage in these discussions. We do have to acknowledge that life is going to end at some point,” she said.   Healthcare professionals identified time constraints and fear of taking away patients’ hope as barriers to engaging in conversations with patients about their end-of-life care preferences. Other barriers included a “cure-at-all-costs” ethos, a lack of training for communicating about end-of-life care options and a failure to identify whose role it was to initiate a conversation.   “Who’s the captain on the ship?” Jabbarian asked. “It’s difficult to take the responsibility.”   As a palliative-care doctor, Levy routinely opens discussions about end-of-life care. Because she knows there is never a perfect time to start the conversation, she advises healthcare professionals to begin a dialogue as soon as possible.   “Do as your mother did and rip off the Band-Aid – the anticipation is the hardest part,” she said.   She listens for openings in conversations, like when patients say things like, “I’m so tired of being sick,” or “I didn’t know if I would ever get well again after that last time.”   The most important part of the conversation is taking the time to hear what a patient has to say, she said.   But the most productive and revealing conversations about end-of-life wishes often take place outside of hospitals and clinics and around dinner tables, Levy said.    “I do think we place too much emphasis on making healthcare environments the place for these conversations,” she said. “Communities are a lovely place to talk about what matters most in the event of illness. At the Thanksgiving dinner, the holiday festivities when everyone is together, these are times to discuss what matters to you.”  "
2h84lUD,2017-11-30,Some hospital services may be expendable on weekends," (Reuters Health) - Removing allied healthcare services from hospitals on weekends may not affect patient outcomes, suggests a new Australian study.   Allied health services involve healthcare providers who aren’t doctors or nurses - such as physical therapists, social workers, and dietitians, for example.   Resources spent on providing allied health services on weekends in acute medical and surgical wards could possibly be better spent elsewhere, say the authors.   “In-hospital allied health services complement medical and nursing services throughout a hospital journey. Allied health is now present in emergency departments, intensive care units, general medical and surgical wards, rehabilitation, oncology and a range of other specialty ward types,” study leader Terry Haines at Monash University in Victoria told Reuters Health by email.   “Understanding (the) tasks and settings in which they provide the greatest value for money for society is a difficult task,” he said.   Weekend allied health services on acute medical and surgical wards started becoming popular internationally around two decades ago, but this was not driven by well-designed research, according to Haines.   “Once a health (facility) has committed to providing this service, it is very difficult to remove. . . . Trials like ours provide an evidence base that should have been created two decades ago before these services were implemented so broadly,” Haines said.   As reported in PLoS Medicine, Haines and his colleagues conducted two trials over the course of about a year, involving almost 15,000 patients.    First, weekend allied health services were incrementally removed from 12 acute surgical or medical wards in two hospitals in Melbourne.   Next, researchers asked doctors, nurses and allied health staff to identify and prioritize the most important tasks for allied health services to provide on weekends. Based on those interviews, newly redeveloped services were reintroduced incrementally into the same wards.    The researchers found that removing allied health services didn’t appear to affect the time patients spent in the hospital and didn’t seem to impact safety issues.    In addition, adding the new services back didn’t seem to improve outcomes. In fact, the proportion of patients who stayed longer than expected, and the proportion of patients who had any adverse event, were slightly lower without weekend allied care.   Health services should be actively trying to find areas where the resources they allocate are not delivering the intended outcomes, Haines said.   “There is some evidence from randomized trials available that allied health services delivered on rehabilitation wards can be effective for improving health outcomes and reducing the length of stay. It could be a simple case of moving allied health resources from the acute medical and surgical wards over to the rehabilitation wards,” he said.   There are many different ways that weekend allied health services can be structured on acute medical and surgical wards, said Haines.   “We did not investigate all these possibilities, rather, we looked at both the pragmatic question of what was currently being provided at the time . . . and what our local managers thought might be the theoretically best way to allocate the same amount of resources available,” he said.   A physiotherapist who was not involved in the research told Reuters Health by email that the study answers some questions but it raises others.   Nicole Bellet, Director of Physiotherapy at the Prince Charles Hospital in Chermside, Queensland, Australia, said some services are best provided by “staff trained and interested in the tasks being delegated.”    There is an argument, she said, for ancillary services on weekends, especially in rehabilitation wards and surgical wards where reduced mobility may mean patients go backwards over the weekend.    “Weekend service for physiotherapy is important for those instances where respiratory function is at risk, mobility and the progression of this is important for patient outcomes and discharge planning,” she added.   “However, there is also the need for the patients to rest, visit with family, trial home stay, etc. So, in essence I believe this paper provides only a small part of the puzzle and hopefully more work will be done in this area,” she said.  "
2zyiP6L,2017-11-30,Psoriasis tied to higher risk of serious liver disease," (Reuters Health) - People with chronic inflammatory disorders like psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis may have an increased risk of developing serious liver damage, a recent study suggests.    These inflammatory disorders are often treated with methotrexate, a medication linked to an increased risk of liver disease. For the current study, researchers followed more than 1 million people for an average of six years to see how having conditions like psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis - and taking methotrexate - influenced the odds of developing serious liver disorders.    Compared to people without chronic inflammatory diseases, people with psoriasis were 37 percent more likely to develop liver disorders. When psoriasis patients took methotrexate, they had roughly twice the odds of liver damage.    With psoriatic arthritis, the increased risk of liver disease was 38 percent without drug therapy and 67 percent with methotrexate. For rheumatoid arthritis, there was no increased risk of liver disease when people took methotrexate, but when they didn’t they had 49 percent higher odds of liver damage.   “This study is the first, to our knowledge, to empirically support the long held belief that psoriasis patients are more prone to serious liver problems compared to patients without psoriasis and those with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis which are treated with similar medications,” said senior study author Dr. Joel Gelfand of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia.    “Medications which are toxic to the liver, such as methotrexate, should be used cautiously in patients with psoriatic disease, especially those with additional risk factors such as obesity or regular alcohol use,” Gelfand said by email.    The study suggests systemic inflammation - which is present in all three diseases - may play a significant role in development of liver disease, particularly in those with psoriasis, researchers note in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.    For the study, researchers examined data on almost 1.3 million people without chronic inflammatory disorders as well as roughly 198,000 psoriasis patients, 12,000 people with psoriatic arthritis and 54,000 with rheumatoid arthritis.    Among people with inflammatory disorders who took systemic therapy - medications that reach the whole body - methotrexate was the most commonly prescribed option.    Overall, 6 percent of psoriasis patients were prescribed systemic therapy, as were 53 percent of people with psoriatic arthritis and 61 percent of people with rheumatoid arthritis.    Independent of risk factors commonly seen in liver disease, such as alcohol use and diabetes, the study found that patients with psoriatic skin or joint disease, particularly patients with more severe skin psoriasis, had an elevated risk for serious liver disease.    Pfizer, which sells a version of methotrexate, has hired Gelfand and another study author as consultants and given them research grants, although the drugmaker wasn’t involved in the design or analysis of the current study. The authors have other financial ties to several other drug companies.    One limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t look at deaths from liver disease. Another drawback is that they lacked data on whether people at risk for liver disease might have been steered away from methotrexate to other therapies.    Even so, the findings add to evidence that patients need to consider the liver risks associated with these disorders, said Dr. Lawrence Eichenfield, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Patients should be aware that psoriasis has health impacts beyond the skin alone, and its management should be considered as an important part of the health of an individual,” Eichenfield said by email. “Liver function tests should be tested in psoriasis patients and the results may influence choices for therapy.”   An alternative treatment for joint pain, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), also carry a risk of liver disease, cautioned Dr. Alexander Egeberg, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Consequently, physicians should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of NSAIDs as well as methotrexate when treating patients with inflammatory diseases,” Egeberg said by email.

2i0vSnV,2017-11-30,Too many HIV-positive youth in U.S. do not notify past partners," (Reuters Health) - Nearly one in four youth living with HIV in the U.S. don’t notify sex or drug-use partners about potential HIV exposure - despite medical professionals and others urging them to do so, a study of teens and young adults suggests.   This high-risk population continues to contract HIV at alarming rates, so identifying individuals unaware of their infection is imperative to prevent further transmission, as well as to link and retain patients into medical care, the study team writes in the Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.    A surprising finding from this survey-based study was that 81.7 percent of participants reported not having been contacted by a partner about their own potential exposure to HIV, said lead author Jacob J. van den Berg of the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island.   It’s possible that their partners had no contact information for them, or that attempts to contact them were unsuccessful. It is also conceivable that they were tested before their partners became aware of their own infection, the study authors point out.    Still, “this number is incredibly high considering that at least one person should have contacted them regarding their own potential exposure according to current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines,” van den Berg told Reuters Health in an email.   Over a fifth of all new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. occur in individuals age 13 to 24, according to CDC estimates. This age group is particularly vulnerable to exposure, the study authors write, because it has the highest proportion of undiagnosed HIV of any age category.   For the study, the researchers recruited 924 mostly male participants between 13 and 24 from fourteen adolescent medicine clinics in U.S. cities with established HIV epidemics. All the participants had been “behaviorally infected,” for example, through sex or drug use.   All of the youth answered an online survey that asked about their past sexual partners and practices, drug-use partners with whom they had shared needles and interactions with healthcare professionals, among other things.     Overall, more than three quarters of the participants reported that once they learned they were HIV positive, they contacted all or at least some of their past sex or drug-use partners to notify them they may have been exposed to HIV. Another 22.4 percent of participants did not succeed or didn’t try to contact former partners.   Nearly all study participants reported that someone, such as their HIV tester, doctor, community clinic representative or a friend/family member, had talked to them about notifying their sexual partners about potential exposure. Just over half of participants, however, said only one person had discussed partner notification with them.    The study team found that youth who had themselves been contacted about potentially being exposed to HIV were more likely to engage in partner notification.    They also found that survey participants were more likely to notify past partners if more than one person had talked to them about notification. That result is the “biggest takeaway” from the study, said Adam Cohen, director of advocacy and policy research at the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles.   Cohen, who wasn’t involved in the study, also highlighted the finding that more than 80 percent of survey participants were not themselves notified of potential HIV exposure. “There is a serious discrepancy between discussing partner notification and engaging in partner notification,” he said by email.   The authors acknowledge that limitations of the study include the fact that participants were already in care, so they might be more likely than youth outside the medical system to notify their partners. Because the data on notification was self-reported, though, it’s also possible that participants exaggerated how often they notified partners.    “Although we do not know if our findings with youth living with HIV will translate to young people living in other countries or to older persons living in the United States,” van den Berg said, “we speculate that the more healthcare professionals or family members/friends who talk to people living with HIV about notifying their sexual partners, the more likely it will be that they will notify their sexual partners regarding potential exposure to HIV.”  "
2jyxGIt,2017-11-30,Kids still get codeine after surgeries despite safety warnings," (Reuters Health) - Even after warnings from doctors and drug regulators about the dangers of opioids for children, 1 in 20 kids still get codeine after two common childhood surgeries, a U.S. study suggests.    Researchers examined records for almost 363,000 children who had tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies from 2010 to 2015. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a so-called black box warning - its strongest - against use of codeine in kids because of the risk of overdoses and deaths.    Following the FDA warning, codeine prescribing related to these two surgeries decreased significantly, by roughly 13 percentage points. But by the end of 2015, nearly three years after the black box warning, about 5 percent of kids were still getting codeine prescriptions after these procedures.    “This is an unacceptable gamble given that there are better alternatives,” said lead study author Dr. Kao-Ping Chua, pediatrician at University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital.    Many kids don’t have severe pain after getting their tonsils out and can manage any discomfort with medicines like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, Chua said. If they need something stronger, alternatives to codeine include oxycodone and hydrocodone.    “Codeine prescribing in children for any reason should be a zero event,” Chua said by email.    Last year, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended against any use of codeine for children.   Codeine used to be one of the most commonly prescribed painkillers for kids after tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in part because it was perceived as safer than higher potency opioids like hydrocodone and oxycodone, researchers note in Pediatrics.    But between 1969 and 2012, the FDA received 13 reports of kids who died or overdosed after taking codeine, including eight who had recently undergone these surgeries.    Many of these overdoses happened in kids with genetic differences that made their bodies rapidly convert codeine into morphine in the liver, leading to dangerously high levels of morphine in the blood that could cause suppression of breathing or even death.    For the study, researchers examined health insurance records for kids up to 18 years old who had private coverage to see how often they got at least one prescription for codeine or other opioids within seven days of surgery. They also looked at how often prescriptions were filled.    At the start of the study, about 31 percent of the kids filled at least one prescription for codeine within 7 days of surgery - and about 32 percent of kids got at least one prescription filled for an alternative opioid.   As of January 2010, codeine products made up 47 percent of prescriptions filled, while the rest were hydrocodone and oxycodone. By the end of the study period, codeine accounted for just 9 percent of prescriptions and the majority were for hydrocodone.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how shifts in recommendations about codeine influenced prescriptions after surgery. It’s also possible that results for kids with private health insurance might not represent what happened for children with other types of benefits or no insurance.    Still, the results suggest that pediatric codeine prescriptions persist in spite of the risks, said Dr. Constance Houck, a researcher at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Parents should know that there are other medications to treat pain such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen or numbing medications,” Houck said by email.   “If an opioid is prescribed, it should be one that does not have to be broken down in the body in order to provide pain relief,” Houck added. “Oxycodone and hydrocodone are two pain medicines that are available in liquid form that can be used instead of codeine.”  "
2zKfn98,2017-11-30,Timing matters when patients need gallstone and weight-loss surgeries," (Reuters Health) - Obese patients who need to have their gallbladder removed and also need weight-loss surgery may have fewer complications if they get the gallbladder procedure first, a Swedish study suggests.    For the study, researchers examined data on about 79,000 patients who had surgery to remove the gallbladder, a procedure known as a cholecystectomy, and almost 36,000 people who had a type of weight-loss surgery known as a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Most of these patients only had one of the procedures, but about 2,650 had both surgeries either simultaneously or separately.    Among patients who had both surgeries, people who had the weight-loss operations first were 35 percent more likely to have complications than individuals who had the gallbladder surgery first, the study found.    Having both operations at the same time was twice as likely to lead to complications as having the gallbladder procedure done first.    “For patients with symptomatic gallstones and obesity (i.e., considering both cholecystectomy and gastric bypass), cholecystectomy should preferentially be performed before gastric bypass,” said lead study author Dr. Viktor Wanjura, a surgeon at Orebro University Hospital in Sweden.   But gallstones that don’t produce symptoms “should never be treated surgically,” Wanjura said by email. “Doing so would introduce unnecessary complications in many patients that would never be troubled by their gallstones at all during their lifetime.”   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how doing one of the two procedures before the other one might influence complication rates.    It’s possible that patients might have nutritional deficits after weight-loss surgeries that might contribute to a higher complication rate with the gallstone removal procedures, Wanjura said. But more research is needed to clearly understand the cause of complications.    Gastric bypass, one of the more common types of weight-loss surgeries, reduces the stomach to about the size of an egg and rearranges the intestine so that food bypasses part of it.   When researchers looked at all of the patients in the study, including the majority of people who only had gallbladder or weight-loss procedures but not both, they found 2.3 percent of people had complications with gallbladder operations and 2.7 percent had complications with weight-loss surgery.    Among people who had both procedures, roughly 13 percent had complications regardless of which operation came first or second.    When gallbladder operations were done after weight-loss surgery, however, almost 16 percent of patients had complications, compared with 8 percent of patients when the gallbladder operation was done first.    Even though the study doesn’t explain why complication rates differed, the results suggest that it makes sense for patients to discuss the ideal order of both operations with doctors before they have surgery, said Dr. Anita Courcoulas, chief of minimally invasive bariatric and general surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center   “I think patients need to be aware that although gallbladder surgery is one of the most common abdominal operations performed, that complications are possible especially in people who also have the diseases of obesity, diabetes, and others,” Courcoulas, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “A patient and their surgeon should have an open and shared decision-making conversation to together weigh the risks and benefits of the timing of both gallbladder and bariatric surgery,” Courcoulas added. “These decisions are best individualized, taking into account the patient’s symptoms, anatomy, and other risks for surgery.”  "
2AYOpsX,2017-11-30,Radiologists want patients to get test results faster," (Reuters Health) - Patients these days expect to get imaging test results more promptly than they did in the past – and radiologists are moving toward making that happen, researchers say.   In most medical practices, radiology teams interpret medical images but aren’t the ones who tell patients about the results. Some radiology groups across the nation are looking for ways to shorten the turnaround time for patients to hear their results, the researchers write in the Journal of the American College of Radiology.   “Historically, medicine has been somewhat patriarchal. When patients interact with health care systems, medicine says we don’t tell test results until they’ve been curated by a doctor,” said Dr. Matthew Davenport of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.    “A paradigm shift is happening where online patient portals are becoming more common, and results are being released there,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “Patients want to see their results in a timely fashion, and we may see that embargo period begin to disappear.”   Davenport’s team surveyed 202 patients at two practices in Ann Arbor, describing six scenarios: a chest X-ray for chest pain, a chest X-ray for pneumonia, an MRI for back pain, a CT or MRI for a brain tumor, and a CT or MRI for cancer treatment. For each scenario, they asked patients how long they’d wait before calling their provider, whether they’d feel anxious while waiting for results, and their preferences for using an online patient portal to get the results.   In general, patients wanted test results in one to three days and would call their providers in one to five days if they hadn’t heard anything. Half of the patients said they expected results within three days after a routine screening, two days after a chest X-ray for chest pain, and one day after tests for pneumonia, a brain tumor or cancer treatment.    Half the patients would wait no more than five days to contact their doctor after a screening exam, two days after tests for chest pain or back pain and one day for tests for pneumonia or a brain tumor.   “In an ideal environment, of course, patients would want to know results instantaneously,” Davenport said. “But even if radiologists complete them in 24 hours, there’s a delay in reporting them to the patients.”   Half of the patients said they had experienced emotional changes, including minimal, mild, moderate, severe or extreme anxiety, while waiting for radiology results.    Generally, patients wanted to hear results from their doctors over the phone rather than in person. But both of those options were preferable to receiving results online. Of the 58 percent who had actually used an online patient portal, however, 94 percent said they had received tests results online and the vast majority liked it.   “Personally, I’ve had family members who have been tested and then they never hear a result,” Davenport said. “They wonder about the results and if they’ve been forgotten, and one thing I’ve learned is that the anxiety around waiting is real and disruptive to people’s lives.”   The researchers were surprised that patients would prefer to contact their doctor or radiologist when they have questions about test results. “In my time as a radiologist, I’ve been contacted a handful of times by patients,” he said. “The current paradigm is that we don’t often interact with patients, so it’s interesting to see that patients might like to talk with us more.”   The American College of Radiology has started a national initiative called Imaging 3.0 that encourages radiologists to take a larger role in high-quality patient care and direct interactions with patients. At NYU Langone Health in New York City, for example, radiologists have shifted the way results are communicated to patients by embedding more images in their test result reports and including the radiologist’s annotations and notes.    “With imaging test results, a picture really can be worth more than 1,000 words,” said Dr. Andrew Rosencrantz of NYU Langone Health, who wasn’t involved with this study.   “For patients, radiology is changing for the better,” Rosencrantz told Reuters Health by phone. “We’re more patient-focused and want to get test results to patients quickly and in a way that’s understandable.”  "
2AeK6IK,2017-11-30,Physicians may be biased against research from poor nations," (Reuters Health) - Physicians in England appear to favor research from high-income countries over research from low-income countries, a bias that could lead to reluctance to adopt cost-saving healthcare innovations, a new study suggests.   “High-income research is disproportionately overvalued, and low-income research is undervalued,” said lead author Dr. Matthew Harris, clinical senior lecturer in public health at the Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London.   “Research from low-income countries is being discounted prematurely and unfairly,” he said in a Skype interview. “That’s a prejudice, a preconceived notion.”   Harris and his team enlisted 347 clinicians in England. The clinicians were told they would be taking a speed-reading survey, but instead of judging them on how fast they read, the researchers examined how participants evaluated the evidence and relevance of four research abstracts.   The abstracts were of similar length and complexity, the research team reports in the journal Health Affairs. Each abstract was labeled as having been written by an unnamed researcher at one of four universities. Two of the universities were in high-income countries – Harvard University in the U.S. and Freiburg University in Germany, and two were in low-income countries – the University of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia and the University of Mzuzu in Malawi.   When the abstracts were labeled as coming from Harvard or Freiburg, clinicians were more likely to rate them as relevant and to consider the study’s evidence as strong. When the same abstract was labeled as coming from the University of Addis Ababa or the University of Mzuzu, clinicians tended to rate it as weaker and less relevant.   The greatest difference in clinician ratings was a 25 percent higher rating for the relevance of a randomized trial of a cholesterol-lowering drug when the abstract was labeled as coming from Harvard or Freiburg as opposed to Addis Ababa or Mzuzu.   Dr. David Kuwayama, a vascular surgeon and professor at the University of Colorado Denver in Aurora who was not involved with the study, said it “clearly illustrates the inherent biases that all of us in academic medicine . . . share when it comes to devaluing research from outside of the U.S. and Europe.”   “If a journal publishes a groundbreaking paper from a low-income country, but we in the Western world are unwilling to value it, then we are depriving both ourselves and our patients of valuable, maybe even life-saving, medical knowledge,” he said in an email.   As a result of prejudices that the study suggests, patients and healthcare systems could be missing out on so-called frugal innovations, Harris said. One example is using a hand drill available in hardware stores in a sterilized bag to perform orthopedic surgery. England’s National Health Service could save an estimated 100 million pounds ($131 million) over five years, if it switched from orthopedic drills to hand drills in sterilized bags, Harris said.   “Many countries that have emerged from poverty are actually developing frugal innovations, doing more with less, increasing value,” he said. “We know that there are some excellent ideas arising from these settings that don’t get the attention they deserve,” he said.   Kuwayama said it would be “dangerously naive to presume that researchers in low-income countries have little to provide us.”   Walter Kukull, epidemiology professor at the University of Washington School of Public Health in Seattle who was not involved with the research, was less concerned about the bias it suggests.   “Part of the effect of the reported study could be due to a reviewer-perceived impression that a project described in the abstract either would not have the resources or recognized expertise in the country to carry out the reported research,” he said by email. “While this is regarded as a ‘bias’ in the paper, it could also go to the element of trust, thus a purposeful judgment.”   The results might have been different, Kukull noted, if study participants had read full papers, which might have reduced perceived bias. Regardless, Kukull was not convinced that the findings showed prejudice.   “As a reviewer of grants, knowing who the investigators are, what they have done and where they are located as well as their scientific environment influences outcomes substantially and probably should,” he said. “I am not as worried as their conclusion implies we should be that great research from low-income countries is being buried or rejected.”  "
2yBNrAV,2017-11-30,Immigrant workers in U.S. have tripled risk for heat-related death," (Reuters Health) - Compared to U.S. citizens, immigrants have more than three times the risk of dying from heat-related illness - with the majority of deaths occurring in just three states, according to a recent study.   The risk is greatest among Hispanic immigrants and those between ages 18 and 24, a group of researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report in the American Journal of Public Health.   “Three states (Arizona, California and Texas) accounted for 94.5 percent of non-citizen heat deaths,” senior study author Rebecca Noe, of the CDC’s Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects at the National Center for Environmental Health in Atlanta, said in an email.    “States where heat deaths are commonly occurring should consider tailoring heat prevention messages,” she told Reuters Health.   The study team looked at 2005-2014 mortality data and residence in the National Vital Statistics System to understand differences in heat-related deaths based on citizenship.    In the United States, an average of 658 people died annually from exposure to excessive natural heat between 1999 and 2009, Noe and her colleagues write in their report. But while heat-related deaths accounted for 0.02 percent of all deaths among U.S. citizens, they represented 2.2 percent among non-citizens, the researchers found.   While immigrants overall had 3.4 times the risk of citizens for dying of heat-related causes, among Hispanics that figure was 3.6 times. For all non-U.S. citizens in the 18-24 age group, the risk was 20.6 times that of citizens, the study also found   Overall, 87 percent of the heat-related deaths occurred among Hispanics, and farms were most often cited as the place of excessive heat exposure.    A limitation of the study is that no occupational information was available to further explain the reason for death. However, it’s likely related to outdoor working conditions on farms, said Tarik Benmarhnia of the University of California at San Diego who wasn’t involved in the study.    A 2012 report by the Arizona Department of Health Services found that more than 1,500 heat-related deaths occurred in the state between 2000 and 2012, and 48 percent of these were among migrants from Mexico, Central America or South America, he noted. These heat-related deaths included adults between ages 20 and 44, Benhmarhnia added.   “When workers are young, they don’t feel the symptoms of heat stroke until it’s too late,” he told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “This is a problem for all workers in general, especially for young people and illegal immigrants working on farms and (in) agricultural activities.”   In the current study, the 5-17 age group among non-citizens also had an increased risk for heat-related death, which Benmarhnia found unusual, but he said it could include agricultural workers between 15 and 17.   “I cannot understand why younger children between ages 5 and 10 would die from heat exposure,” he said. “It’s likely teens who are exposed to heat on the job but less experienced. They may take more risks.”   Future studies should identify specific risk factors for heat-related deaths, such as differences in health, lifestyle, occupation or cultural behaviors, the study authors write.    Benmarhnia is studying spatial and geographical patterns linked to heat-related death. In New York City and certain California cities, for example, neighborhoods with more construction work and high afternoon temperatures may have the highest risk. In a study of Paris, Benmarhnia and colleagues found that heat-related deaths occurred in a handful of neighborhoods. Green spaces decreased the risk of death and high air pollution increased the effects of extreme heat.   “When a heat wave occurs, policymakers don’t have to focus on everywhere,” he said. “They can focus their energy on promoting messages in these certain areas where people are dying.”   "
2m9Qj6n,2017-11-30,Waiting to conceive after miscarriage may not be needed," (Reuters Health) - One miscarriage doesn’t necessarily increase the risk of another, and counseling women to delay conception after a pregnancy loss may not be warranted, a recent study suggests.   Researchers in the U.S. found that women participating in a larger long-term study who conceived within three months of a pregnancy loss had the lowest likelihood of another miscarriage compared to women who waited 6 to 18 months.   “We observed that the advice doctors give to women about when to start trying to get pregnant after experiencing a miscarriage varies significantly,” senior study author Digna Velez Edwards told Reuters Health in an email.   “Using the ‘Right from the Start’ prospective pregnancy cohort we wanted to further examine this and see if the time between pregnancies (interpregnancy interval) after a miscarriage influenced a woman’s chance of having a miscarriage in her next pregnancy,” said Velez Edwards, a researcher at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.   About 17 percent of clinically recognized pregnancies end in loss, the study team writes in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology. Most women who experience a miscarriage want to know if they can prevent another miscarriage and may ask their health care providers how long they should wait before trying to conceive again.   The Right from the Start study included almost 6,000 women in North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas who were pregnant or planning a pregnancy between 2000 and 2012.    Participants filled out health interviews when they entered the study and again at the end of their first trimester. All the women underwent ultrasounds to confirm their pregnancies.    A total of 514 women said miscarriage was the outcome of their most recent pregnancy before entering the study. Of those women, about 16 percent had a subsequent miscarriage.   When the study team compared interpregnancy intervals, they found that women with intervals of less than three months had about a 7 percent risk of repeat miscarriage, compared with a 22 percent risk for women who waited 6 to 18 months weeks after the miscarriage to get pregnant again.   Neither race, nor the number of children a woman already had, made a difference in these results.    Limitations of the study include its size, and the fact that researchers could not assess whether the higher chances of successful pregnancy after a shorter interval might be explained by factors other than the length of the interval, such as the women’s overall “high reproductive fitness.”   “Although our study demonstrated that getting pregnant within three months of a previous miscarriage was associated with the lowest risk of a subsequent miscarriage, when to start trying is specific to each woman and depends on when she is ready to start trying again,” Velez Edwards said.   The World Health Organization currently recommends waiting at least 6 months before attempting another pregnancy, the study team notes. That advice is based on a single study, Velez Edwards said, and the new results are consistent with more recent studies supporting shorter intervals.   Women who are emotionally and physically ready to try to get pregnant after a miscarriage may not have to delay getting pregnant to reduce the risk of miscarriage, said Velez Edwards.   “If (women) want to try to get pregnant, there’s no need to wait unless they personally want to,” said Dr. Thomas Price, an infertility specialist with Duke Health in Durham, North Carolina, who wasn’t involved in the study.   Price noted that the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists puts out bulletins with recommendations. “If you read the ACOG recommendation in their bulletins, they do not recommend any wait time after a miscarriage,” he said.   "
2hwITJ5,2017-11-30,Cardiac arrest study in young athletes raises heart screening questions," (Reuters Health) - Screening exams to identify young athletes at risk for cardiac arrest might not be worthwhile, a new study suggests.   Having your heart stop while playing a sport is very unusual, and fewer than 1 in 5 cases of sudden cardiac arrest among competitive amateur athletes would have been predicted by a screening examination, the authors of a study from Canada say.   “Our results indicate that sudden cardiac death during participation in competitive sports is rare, the causes are varied, and more than 80 percent of cases would not have been identified with the use of systematic (screening),” the research team, led by Dr. Paul Dorian at the University of Toronto, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine.   Not only do screening programs exclude people who could safely engage in sports, he told Reuters Health by phone, the money spent on them could be better used by having defibrillators handy at competition sites and training people to use them.   “In a way, it’s a sobering finding because I think the assumption has been that if we were aggressive at screening, we could greatly improve the problem,” said Dr. Ben Abella, professor of emergency medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who was not involved in the research.   “And while I think screening may have an important role, this study highlights another important consequence. We need to prepare athletic trainers and venues for the event of cardiac arrest,” he told Reuters Health by phone.   The analysis looked at every instance of cardiac arrest that occurred from 2009 through 2014 in people age 12 to 45 among 6.6 million residents in the southern Ontario area.   During that time, there were 74 sport-related cardiac arrests. Only 16 of the 74 occurred during or within an hour of playing a competitive sport; the rest were among people involved in a non-competitive sport, where no formal league was involved.   And only 3 of those 16 cases “were determined to have been potentially identifiable if the athletes had undergone participation screening,” said the researchers.   Dr. Dorian and his team calculated that the odds of an athlete developing a sudden arrest during competition or training was 1 in 131,600 per year, with 44 percent surviving to be discharged from the hospital.   To put that in perspective, the odds of a sudden cardiac arrest among the general population age 12 to 45 is about 6 times higher - or 1 in 20,700 per year.   “The risk in these athletes is extraordinarily small, less than what’s previously been believed,” although it may seem higher because such instances of sudden death are shockingly unexpected and widely publicized, said Dr. Dorian, who is also a cardiologist at St. Michael’s Hospital. “That’s not to say it doesn’t happen. I don’t want to minimize the individual tragedies for families, loved ones and teammates.”   The group was not able to calculate the odds for people engaged in non-organized competitions because of uncertainty over the number of people involved and their degree of effort.    Among athletes under 35, a structural problem with the heart or a heart rhythm problem were the most common causes. For ages 35 to 45, the most common cause was a narrowing of the arteries feeding the heart muscle.   “It’s been assumed without any proof that more than half of individuals that are destined to die suddenly or have a cardiac arrest can be detected if you have these screening programs,” said Dr. Dorian. “What we’ve shown is the most common disorders that lead to cardiac arrest are the kinds of disorders which are not detectable with these screening programs.”   “We need automated external defibrillators available,” said Dr. Abella. “We need trainers or security staff or coaches trained in CPR and emergency response, because we’re not going to prevent this problem by screening.”   And the biggest problem with the screening programs, Dr. Dorian said, is that they raise a false alarm in too many amateur athletes.   “Screening athletes is likely to cause more harm than benefit,” he said. “It’s the worry, concern, fright - which is mostly unnecessary - that these young individuals and families have to undergo when they’re identified as maybe having a problem while they’re waiting for test results.”   “And even if a problem comes up, in fact, the risk would likely be very, very small,” said Dr. Dorian. “For the majority of people, the benefits of participating in competitive sports far outweigh any risk of sudden cardiac arrest.”  "
2mL9bZZ,2017-11-30,Cancer survivors often living with PTSD," (Reuters Health) - Cancer patients may often experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the months after their tumors are diagnosed, and mental health issues can sometimes linger for years, a Malaysian study suggests.   Six months after diagnosis, 22 percent of cancer patients reported symptoms of PTSD in clinical evaluations, researchers report in Cancer. After four years, about 6 percent of patients had PTSD.   Although overall rates of PTSD decreased over time, one-third of patients initially diagnosed with the mental health disorder had persistent or worsening symptoms four years later.   “PTSD can affect anyone who has witnessed or experienced a serious threat of violence or death,” said lead study author Caryn Mei Hsien Chan of the National University of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur.    “While PTSD is more often associated with traumatic events such as violent physical and sexual attacks, serious accidents and natural disasters, this includes being diagnosed with cancer, the experience of undergoing cancer treatment and surviving cancer,” Chan said by email. “Even if they do not have full-blown PTSD most cancer patients experience some symptoms of it.”   For the study, researchers followed 469 patients at one cancer center in Malaysia who had psychological evaluations at various points after their diagnosis. A total of 210 patients died during the four-year study.    Six months after their cancer diagnosis, 27 of 203 patients, or 13.3 percent, met the full criteria for newly developed PTSD, and another 17 people, or 8.4 percent, had several symptoms of PTSD.   Taken together, these two groups show more than one in five patients with serious PTSD symptoms at six months.    At the four-year mark, 10 of 245 patients, or 4.1 percent, had full PTSD and another 5 patients had several serious symptoms. Combined, this translates into serious PTSD symptoms affecting about 6 percent of patients.    Among the 27 people with PTSD after six months, 6 had full-blown PTSD after four years and another 2 had serious symptoms.    Results for breast cancer patients in the study suggest that counseling may help avert or ease the severity of PTSD.    At six months, compared with other cancer patients, people with breast cancer were more than three times less likely to have developed PTSD. In this early postoperative period, breast cancer patients were most likely receiving counseling to help them cope with their diagnosis and treatment.    There wasn’t a meaningful difference between breast cancer patients and people with other types of malignancies after four years however.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how cancer diagnosis or treatment might influence the odds of developing PTSD.    And, not all anxiety related to cancer is PTSD, said senior study author Dr. Fremonta Meyer, a psychiatrist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.    “Anxiety and fear about recurrence or progression are nearly universal among cancer patients,” Meyer said by email. “But intrusive memories and repeatedly mentally replaying difficult aspects of the cancer diagnosis or treatment may be warning signs of PTSD.”   While it’s encouraging that most patients in the study with PTSD six months after diagnosis no longer had it after four years, doctors and patients should still be aware that its symptoms might last that long for some people, said Dr. Alexander Kutikov of Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia.   “Studies such as this underscore that involvement of a mental health professional who can appropriately evaluate and help manage psychological and psychiatric responses to a cancer diagnosis is an important part of multidisciplinary cancer care,” Kutikov, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Being sad for one year after a cancer diagnosis is normal, but people who aren’t getting better at that point may need to see a mental health specialist, said Geertruida H. de Bock, a researcher at the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Cancer related post traumatic stress can occur anytime during or after treatment,” de Bock said by email. “It’s comparable to the death of a close friend or relative.”  "
2AWSttH,2017-11-30,Risk of breast cancer recurrence lasts for decades," (Reuters Health) - Many women who follow initial breast cancer treatment with five years of hormone therapy to keep tumors at bay may still experience new malignancies up to two decades after their diagnosis, a study suggests.    Researchers examined data from 88 clinical trials involving 62,923 women with what’s known as estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors, a common type of breast cancer that responds to hormone-based treatments.    After treating ER-positive tumors with chemotherapy, radiation or surgery, women typically get five years of follow-up therapy in the form of daily hormone-based pills – either tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors. The goal of such so-called adjuvant therapy is to destroy any lingering cancer cells not killed by initial treatment.    All of the women were cancer-free when they completed five years of adjuvant hormone-based therapy.    During the next 15 years, however, cancer returned for 41 percent of the highest-risk women in the study who originally had the largest tumors that had spread the most beyond the breast, the study found.    Even the lowest-risk women who originally had small tumors that hadn’t spread to the lymph nodes or other parts of the body still had 10 percent odds of cancer coming back during the study, researchers report in the New England Journal of Medicine.    “We know that adjuvant (hormone-based) therapy for 5 years substantially reduces the risk of recurrence and mortality,” said senior study author Dr. Daniel Hayes of the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center in Ann Arbor.    “We now have good evidence that extending adjuvant (hormone-based) therapy beyond five years continues to suppress and reduce recurrence and mortality,” Hayes said by email.    Doctors have long known that five years of tamoxifen reduces recurrence by approximately half during treatment, and by nearly a third over the next five years. Aromatase inhibitors, which work only in post-menopausal women, are even more effective than tamoxifen at reducing recurrence and death from breast cancer.   Some recent research suggests an additional five years of hormone-based, or endocrine, therapy is even more effective, but the side effects make some women reluctant to continue. Life-threatening side effects are rare, but women taking these hormones can have menopause symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal dryness.    The data suggest that women with ER-positive breast cancer should at least consider continuing adjuvant therapy beyond five years, the authors conclude.    “Breast cancer cells can travel from the primary tumor to the lymph nodes and can circulate throughout the body undetectable with current screening (methods) and over time, these circulating cancer cells can attach to other organs in the body and this is generally when there is a detectable cancer recurrence,” said Albert Farias, a cancer researcher at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles who wasn’t involved in the study.    “One way that adjuvant breast cancer treatment works is to kill and/or stop the undetectable cancer cells from growing and dividing,” Farias said by email.    Even though the study suggests some women may have more risk of recurrence based on their original tumor characteristics, it can still be hard to predict and women need to remain vigilant, said Dr. Sharon Giordano of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.   “Breast cancer can be dormant for many years, so that women can have no apparent disease, but can still recur years later if the tumor becomes active again,” Giordano said by email. “We do not know why some cancers become active again after years of dormancy.”   Women need regular checkups and breast screenings, as well as annual mammograms, said Dr. Alana Biggers, a researcher at the University of Illinois-Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study.    “If a woman is high risk for breast cancer, such as a lady with a gene mutation, she may need both mammograms and breast MRIs,” Biggers added by email. “Additionally, women should maintain a healthy weight, exercise, stop smoking, and limit alcohol consumption to reduce their risk of recurrence.”  "
2jdZ9LV,2017-11-30,Female doctors adjust lives to accommodate home," (Reuters Health) - Female physicians are more likely to make professional adjustments to accommodate their responsibilities at home, according to a new study.   In particular, male doctors tend to have more help at home for childcare or elder care, the study authors reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Nearly half of the spouses of male physicians stopped working professionally, versus 9 percent of spouses of female physicians.   “Although some might argue that the decision for women to stop working professionally, especially after having children, is volitional, I think it’s very hard to disentangle the influence of societal expectations from that ‘choice,’” said study author Dr. Dan Ly of Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.    In earlier work, Ly and colleagues had found that the gender earnings gap among doctors has remained at about 20 percent for the past three decades. Furthermore, among physicians who teach at medical schools, women are less likely to obtain the highest rank of full professor.    “To try to explain some of these gender differences in pay and professional advancement among physicians, we have begun to look at home life,” Ly told Reuters Health by email.   Ly and colleagues looked at Census Bureau data between 2000-2015 to understand occupation, income, hours worked outside the home and graduate education status for 30,900 male doctors and 17,600 female doctors. They also looked at the number of children in families with a male doctor, a female doctor, or two doctor parents.    They found that 17 percent of male doctors were married to female doctors, whereas 31 percent of female doctors were married to male doctors.    Income, hours worked outside the home, and graduate education status differed greatly between female spouses of male doctors and male spouses of female doctors.   Overall, 52 percent of female doctors’ spouses had a graduate degree, compared to 40 percent of male doctors’ spouses. In couples with one doctor, the number of children was higher in families with a sole male physician versus a sole female physician. In addition, for all women, the average number of paid work hours decreased as the male spouse’s paid work hours increased.   “We think one possible reason for this is that societal expectations for women to reduce their professional hours to care for children exist, even for physicians,” Ly said.   Future studies will continue to look at the decisions that couples make about balancing each other’s careers and how having children factors into those decisions, he said.   “It’s important to understand why women in medicine and other professions might be facing unique challenges, even today,” Dr. Reshma Jagsi, director of the Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, told Reuters Health by phone.    “Those of us in Generation X were raised with expectations of the egalitarian division of labor at home and work, and we might not expect the findings seen in studies like these,” said Jagsi, who researches the gender pay gap and gender domestic differences in medicine but who wasn’t involved Ly’s study.   Jagsi and colleagues are monitoring several new programs that have been implemented to help doctors at work and home. The Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, for example, gave grants to 10 medical schools as the Fund to Retain Clinical Scientists to fund more mentorship and career development opportunities for early-career doctors, especially for those with extra caregiving burdens.    “Patients benefit when the medical workforce includes the most promising doctors in our society,” Jagsi said. “We need both women and men in the medical workforce, and we need to figure out ways society can alleviate the greater challenges faced by female physicians.”  "
2iJvZnm,2017-11-30,"Many hospitals lack specialists for hand, face emergencies"," (Reuters Health) - In an emergency involving face or hand trauma, barely one in four hospitals can muster a specialist surgeon, a recent U.S. study suggests.   In a survey of hospitals in New York State, excluding those in New York City, researchers found that only 27 percent had hand surgeons available or on call for emergency hand procedures and 29 percent had plastic surgeons available for facial emergencies.   “Although more people have insurance now, it doesn’t guarantee access, especially in areas with geographic barriers,” said senior study author Dr. Ashit Patel, the chief of plastic surgery at Albany Medical College.    In his practice in Albany, for example, patients are often drawn from 20 counties in New York, as well as Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont and Canada, Patel noted.    “Nearly every small town has a small hospital, and these hospitals deliver elective care, but there’s not anyone available 24/7 for emergencies,” he told Reuters Health in a phone interview.    Some 40 million injuries are treated in U.S. emergency departments annually, the study authors write in the Annals of Plastic Surgery, and facial and hand traumas make up more than 20 percent of these injuries.   If they are not treated by a specialist surgeon, or if treatment is delayed in order to transfer a patient to a facility where a specialist is available, these injuries can have poorer outcomes and ultimately higher costs, the study team writes.   To see how often New York patients do have access to these specialists in emergency situations, Patel and colleagues surveyed 52 hospitals throughout the state. They asked about available elective hand surgeries - which are scheduled in advance - such as carpal tunnel release, finger fracture reduction and microsurgery, and elective facial procedures like deviated septum surgery, eyelid surgery and nose surgery.    They also asked whether surgeons who had at least done fellowship-level training in these specialties were available on site or on call for emergency cases.   The researchers found that access to these surgeons in New York State is fairly good for elective procedures: 88 percent of the hospitals surveyed offered specialist hand surgeries and 79 percent offered facial surgery.   Increasing the number of specialists who are on call for emergencies could decrease the need for transfer of minor traumas, which would reduce trauma center costs and reduce burden on hub hospitals, the study authors conclude.   “There is benefit in regionalization of care for complex trauma, and there is always going to be a role for this type of concentration of patients with devastating injuries,” said Dr. Megan Patterson, a professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “It’s the care of the less complex injuries that could be improved upon,” she told Reuters Health by email. “It’s not just that the patient is transferred . . . but they will then be required to come back for follow-up visits, which can be a significant burden to the patient and their families.”   Telemedicine approaches such as phone consultations, digital X-ray review and email connection to a specialist could help manage patients, she said.   “Access is only going to continue to be more challenging as reimbursement rates drop and smaller rural hospitals close,” Patterson said.   “Medicaid patients who live (on) up to 138 percent of the poverty line don’t have the resources to travel distances for the right care,” Patel said. “They’re choosing between feeding their children and paying for gas.”   Talking to state legislators about the data is key, too, Patel said. He’s spoken with members of both parties and found similar studies in states such as Tennessee and New Jersey that show a discrepancy in specialist access for trauma.    “It’s impractical to say that the one specialist should be on call all day, every day, so we have to look at how insurance and Medicaid can change,” he added.   “Many residents in these smaller communities may not realize how narrow their insurance networks are,” Patel noted. “Buyer beware about the insurance you have. Do your homework.”  "
2za1vBY,2017-11-30,"Hand, wrist injuries in high school sports often severe"," (Reuters Health) - High school athletes have high rates of hand and wrist injuries, especially in certain sports, according to a new U.S. study.    Football players have the highest risk by far, but lacrosse, field and ice hockey, wrestling, softball and basketball also carry higher odds of these injuries, which can require costly surgery and keep kids out of the game for weeks, the authors say.   “Stick and ball or puck sports and full contact sports have high rates of hand/wrist injuries relative to other sports, which is indicative of a need for sport-specific prevention efforts,” Dr. Bernadette Johnson of Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora and her colleagues write in Pediatrics.    While playing sports has clear health benefits for children and teens, young athletes do run the risk of injury, the study team notes. Hand and wrist injuries represent 17 percent of pediatric and adolescent sports injuries, they add, and can affect students’ ability to complete their school work in addition to keeping them off the field.    The researchers looked at 11 academic years’ worth of data from a large sample of high schools in the National High School Sports-Related Injury Surveillance Study, starting in 2005-2006 through 2015-2016.   Over the course of 40,195,806 athlete exposures (AEs) during games or practices, there were 6,723 hand/wrist injuries, for an overall rate of 1.7 injuries per 10,000 AEs. About half of the injuries occurred during competition and half during practice, but because players spend more time practicing than competing, injury rates were actually three times higher during games.   During the study period, 8.5 percent of all reported injuries involved the hand and/or the wrist. The hand/wrist injury rate was highest in football, at 4.3 per 10,000 AEs. The injury rates ranged from 1.7 to 1.9 per 10,000 AEs for boys’ lacrosse, softball, wrestling, girls’ field hockey, boys’ ice hockey and girls’ basketball.   When boys and girls played the same sport or similar ones, girls’ hand and wrist injury rates were usually higher, although injury rates for girls’ lacrosse were lower than for boys’ lacrosse.   Forty-five percent of the injuries were fractures, while 11.6 percent were bruises and 9.0 percent were ligament sprains. Most were due to contact with another player (40.9 percent), equipment (30.3 percent) or playing surface (25.1 percent).   Athletes returned to play within a week in 45.7 cases, while 12.4 percent were out of play for three weeks or more. Medical disqualification, for the season or for an athlete’s career, occurred with 5.6 percent of injuries.   More than 80 percent of injuries required imaging tests and nearly 8 percent required surgery, the study found.   While the rate of hand and wrist injuries overall and during practice declined between the 2005-2006 and 2015-2016 academic years, the study team notes that the rate of such injuries during competition hasn’t changed.    “These findings reveal the need for a renewed focus on identifying effective injury prevention programs,” they write. Some are relatively easy fixes, they suggest, include requiring protective gloves for girls’ field hockey and lacrosse.   “Given the prevalence of hand/wrist injuries in this population, as well as the potential negative effects of these injuries, including time loss from play, financial costs, and academic challenges, more concerted efforts should be made to prevent sports-related hand/wrist injuries,” they write.   Dr. Johnson was not available for an interview by press time.  "
2ji0MIa,2017-11-30,Motorcycle crashes cause far more severe injuries than car accidents," (Reuters Health) - Motorcycle crashes are much more likely to cause severe injuries, fatalities and extensive medical costs than car accidents, a Canadian study suggests.    While plenty of previous research has documented the potential for motorcycle collisions to lead to far more extensive injuries than car crashes, the current study offers fresh evidence of the financial toll, researchers write in CMAJ.    Researchers examined data on 26,831 patients injured in motorcycle crashes and 281,826 hurt in car accidents. Overall, the injury rate for motorcycle crashes was three times the injury rate for car crashes, the study found.    Severe injuries were 10 times more likely with motorcycle crashes.    Motorcycle crashes, meanwhile, cost about twice as much as car accidents to treat over the first two years after the collisions. The average cost with motorcycle crashes was $5,825 Canadian dollars (about US$4,569) compared with $2,995 (about US$2,349) for car accidents.   “We have shown that (accidents involving) motorcycles are considerably more dangerous and costly than (those involving) cars, and it is likely that will always be the case,” said lead study author Dr. Daniel Pincus of Sunnybrook Hospital and the University of Toronto.   “The study matters because despite considerable improvements in motor vehicle safety over the last 20 years, mortality and morbidity attributed to motorcycle trauma has remained stable or increased,” Pincus said by email. “Estimating the medical costs of care for motorcycle crashes may provide an additional incentive to improve safety.”   Pincus and colleagues looked at medical records for Ontario residents who were treated in emergency departments or admitted to the hospital after car or motorcycle crashes between 2007 and 2013.    To evaluate the medical costs of crash injuries, researchers examined compared costs of treating accident victims to a control group of otherwise similar individuals in Ontario who were not in collisions.    The annual injury rate for motorcycles was 2,194 people out of every 100,000 registered owners, compared with 718 people out of every 100,000 registered car owners, the study found.    With costs roughly doubled and injury rates roughly three times higher with motorcycles than with cars, researchers estimated that the total health costs of injuries was about six times higher for motorcycle owners than for car owners.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how motorcycle crashes might cause worse injuries or higher medical costs than car crashes.    Researchers also lacked data on costs covered by private health insurance or indirect costs such as lost wages or reduced productivity incurred by individual patients.    Even so, the findings add to the evidence linking motorcycle crashes to a higher risk of injuries, said Dr. Lois Lee, an emergency medicine physician at Boston Children’s Hospital and researcher at Harvard Medical School who wasn’t involved in the study.    Because motorcyclists are much more exposed on the road, there’s a much higher risk that crashes will result in injuries to the thorax, abdominal area, head and extremities, Lee said. Helmets help prevent head injuries but don’t protect the rest of the body.    “Motorcyclists should understand the increased dangers associated with riding a motorcycle and that the risk of serious injury and medical costs are significantly increased compared with riding inside an automobile involved in a motor vehicle crash,” Lee said by email. “To try to mitigate head injuries, motorcyclists should wear a helmet and follow the posted speed limit.”  "
2mIW7E8,2017-11-30,Substituting methadone for opioids could save billions," (Reuters Health) - Policymakers and insurers have been pushing people addicted to opioids into abstinence-based detox programs, but a new study concludes that methadone and similar drug-maintenance treatments save lives and money.   If the nearly 47,000 Californians who began treatment for opioid-use disorder in 2014 had received immediate access to methadone or another opioid-agonist treatment – instead of first being forced to completely withdraw from opioids – the healthcare and criminal-justice systems would have saved $3.8 billion, researchers estimate.    Moreover, 1,262 lives would have been spared, lead researcher Emanuel Krebs, a health economist at the British Columbia Center for Excellence in HIV/AIDS in Vancouver, British Columbia, said by Skype.    “If you offer opioid-agonist treatment from the outset, people live longer, and they incur lower costs on society,” said senior author Bohdan Nosyk, a health economist and professor at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia.    “People may not want to stay in treatment, but it’s their best chance of staying alive,” he said in a Skype interview.   Methadone and buprenorphine, opioid agonists, bind to the brain’s opioid receptors; the correct dose will eliminate withdrawal symptoms and cravings. International addiction experts consider initial opioid-agonist treatment, or OAT, with no duration restrictions, the evidence-based standard of care for opioid-use disorder, the authors write in Annals of Internal Medicine.   But in California, where more people have been diagnosed with opioid disorder than in any other U.S. state, publicly funded treatment programs require patients to “fail” - twice - at a three-week course of medically supervised withdrawal before they become eligible for OAT.   “My belief is that California’s persisted with this medically managed withdrawal because they think they’re saving themselves money,” Nosyk said. “You’re paying more than that in the criminal justice sector, in the healthcare section in the long run.”   Using state data, Nosyk, Krebs and colleagues created a computer model to examine the impact immediate access to OAT would have had on Californians treated for opioid-use disorder in 2014.    It would have saved as much as $850 million over five years, not including savings to the criminal-justice system, and more than $2 billion, including the cost of arrests and prosecutions, the study found.   Over 10 years, the total savings would rise to $2.87 billion, the model showed.   “We have to prevent new cases of addiction,” said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at Brandeis University’s Heller School for Social Policy and Management in Boston. “But for the millions who are addicted, the study authors nailed it – the effective treatment, the opioid-agonist treatment, needs to be very easy to access.”   “It’s very hard to recover with an abstinence-based approach. Most people can’t do it, yet that’s been the first-line treatment. That’s why we’re failing,” he said in a phone interview.   Opioids killed more than 33,000 people in the U.S. in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prescription painkillers are fueling the epidemic.    “If we want to see overdose deaths come down, we need to make sure people who have opioid addiction are able to access effective treatment more easily than they can access heroin, fentanyl or pain pills,” said Kolodny, who was not involved with the study.    An editorial accompanying the study says it adds to decades of data on the efficacy of opioid agonists and should lead policymakers to spend fewer healthcare resources on medically supervised withdrawal and more on opioid-agonist treatment.    The editorial writers, Dr. Jeanette Tetrault and Dr. David Fiellin of Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, likened treating opioid disorder with medically assisted withdrawal to treating diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication of diabetes, without addressing diabetes.   Dr. Anna Lembke, a professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine in Stanford, California, sees opioid-use disorder as a life-threatening disease.    “A person injecting heroin is the equivalent from a medical perspective of a person having a heart attack,” said Lembke, who treats opioid addicts with buprenorphine and was not involved with the new study. “Lifesaving treatment can’t wait.”   California’s guidelines should be changed to allow patients immediate access to opioid agonists, she said by email.   “We need a model whereby patients can get immediate access to opioid-agonist treatment, a lifesaving intervention, without obstacles,” she said.    Some patients are forced to wait months for treatment, she said, and in the meantime most of them will relapse, and many will die.   “Among experts in the field of addiction, we already know that detox doesn’t work, that they’re going to relapse and when they relapse, they’re going to be at great risk for an overdose, that they’ll be at great risk for hepatitis,” Kolodny said. “Opioid addiction is a life-threatening illness.”  "
2A8k8Yy,2017-11-30,Stressed out parents less likely to cook homemade meals," (Reuters Health) - On days when parents feel stressed or depressed, kids are less likely to get homemade food for dinner, a U.S. study suggests.   Beyond just serving up more fast food and frozen dinners, parents are also more likely to pressure kids to clean their plates on days when they’re not in a great mood.   “One potential explanation for these findings is that parents who have a stressful day at work, school or home or who feel depressed throughout the day may be overwhelmed and not feel like making a family meal, and so they opt for pre-prepared foods and make less homemade foods,” said lead study author Jerica Berge of the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis.    “In addition, if parents feel stressed or depressed, they may also pressure their children to eat more at the meal because they don’t want them to waste food, or because they are worried their child is not getting enough food to eat,” Berge said by email.    For the study, researchers observed 150 children ages 5 to 7 years at home with their families and used several methods to assess how parents’ moods influenced what foods went on the table.    Among other things, researchers did home visits to observe meal planning and preparation and examined data from food diaries, surveys and interviews.    Most of the adult participants were mothers (35 years old on average). More than half worked at least part-time, and 61 percent of them had no more than a high school diploma.    Approximately half of the mothers were married, and 64 percent of the households had two parents.    More than two-thirds of the families had a household income of less than $35,000 a year.    Overall, stress levels were low and depression was uncommon, the researchers report in Pediatrics.    However, their statistical analysis found that each one-unit increase in stress levels or depression was associated with a small decrease in the proportion of dinners that included homemade foods, the study found.   With each one-unit increase in stress levels, parents were also 45 percent more likely to pressure kids to eat. Each one-unit increase in depression, meanwhile, was linked to 42 percent higher odds that parents would pressure kids to clean their plates.    The study was small, and it wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how parents’ mood or mental health influences what kids eat.   Even so, it offers fresh evidence of the connection between stress and eating behaviors, said Nancy Zucker, a psychologist and eating disorders specialist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.    “It is really tough to make homemade cooking a priority when one is overwhelmed,” Zucker, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Just knowing that stress or depression might lead to less healthy meals isn’t enough on its own to help parents change what they put on the table, Zucker added. To change, parents need support, she said.    “To the extent that families can have a greater sense of community - cooking with each other, getting young children to feel part of the meal process - can help take away some of the demands and the loneliness that may arise from a stressful, depressing day,” Zucker said.    Planning ahead may also help, said Myles Faith, a psychology researcher at the University at Buffalo in New York who wasn’t involved in the study.    This might include tuning in to certain times of the day or week when stress levels or depression peak, and then choosing different times to make grocery lists, go shopping and prepare meals, Faith said by email.    “It may be better to get all meal decisions set up in advance so that healthier feeding routines become more automatic and require less mental energy the moment kids charge to the dinner table,” Faith advised.   "
2mZkSfH,2017-11-30,Baby-gender &#039;reveal&#039; parties may have a dark side," (Reuters Health) - Expectant parents are bringing back the surprise element of having a baby by learning the results of prenatal ultrasound reports in ever more elaborate “gender-reveal” parties.   In front of friends and relatives, they play treasure-hunt style guessing games, pop balloons to watch either pink or blue confetti fall, and cut into frosted cakes to discover the color of their unborn baby’s future. Loved ones squeal – usually, but not always, with delight – and often they broadcast video of their celebrations across their social networks.   But, in a new editorial in Pediatrics, a pediatric endocrinologist questions the merits of this trendy pre-parenting custom.   “Are these traditions truly harmless?” asks Dr. Leena Nahata, a professor at The Ohio State University College of Medicine in Columbus. “By celebrating this single ‘fact’ several months before an infant’s birth, are we risking committing ourselves and others to a particular vision and a set of stereotypes that are actually potentially harmful?”    Nahata works with transgender children and families of infants born with congenital conditions that complicate a gender designation. Currently, she writes in her editorial, 1 in 4500 to 5500 infants are born with such conditions.   Nahata counsels parents as they wrestle to recast stories they told themselves about their children’s futures, dreams of cheering on a son at a Little League game or shopping for a prom dress with a daughter.   She developed a deeper understanding of what the parents of her patients experience four years ago, when she was visibly pregnant and everyone she met asked the same question: “What are you having?”   She’d chosen not to know the gender of her unborn child. But the more she replied that she didn’t know, the more she came to understand the struggles of her patients’ families.   “It was eye-opening,” Nahata said in a phone interview. “If we can’t identify people by their gender, we’re at a loss to identify them.”   Nahata is not advocating doing away with gender-reveal parties. Instead, she’s holding up the popular fad to interrogate the emphasis society places on gender, even before a child is born.   Her questions: “Why do we focus on gender as early as pregnancy, and if it’s planning, what are we planning? Is it so important to know and celebrate this one aspect of a child? What expectations do we hold for our child just based on gender? How does that shape our expectations of our children?”   Meanwhile, she said, “I think it’s notable that as these gender reveals are becoming more and more elaborate, we’re having increasing awareness in pediatric healthcare that gender may not be as straightforward, or as black and white, as we once thought.”   In her presentations as medical director of the Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy uses gender-reveal parties as an example of what she sees as the outsized expectations people put on children’s expected gender.   “I have seen the fallout of what it means to a child when their gender was different than their assigned sex at birth,” Olson-Kennedy said in a phone interview. “The parents of the trans kids I take care of will often say, ‘I have to mourn the loss of a son or a daughter.’ But your kid’s not dead. You’re mourning the future stories about whatever it is that you’ve created about your child.”   She applauded the editorial for opening a conversation and welcomed Nahata’s suggestion that instead of labor room doctors or nurses proclaiming, “It’s a boy,” or “It’s a girl,” they announce, “Congratulations, you have a beautiful infant!”    The imagery of gender-reveal parties - pistols or pearls, wheels or heels, m&m’s with nuts or no nuts - strikes Olson-Kennedy as hyper-masculine and hyper-feminine.   “Why are we talking about wheels and heels?” she asked. “Why do we have to have such strong messages about what boys and girls should wear, what they should play with? Why do we have to be gender police?”   “It boxes people in,” she said.   Dr. Peter Lee, a pediatric endocrinologist and professor at Penn State College of Medicine in Hersey, Pennsylvania, told Reuters Health that long before marketers assigned pink to girls and blue to girls, men wore high heels to horseback ride, and European men outfitted themselves in lace.   “I sort of thought pink and blue, these colors, were something that was in the past,” he said. “Gender-reveal parties are overemphasizing the gender. The excitement of having a new life - independent of gender - is something to be celebrated.”  "
2jUdukp,2017-11-30,Brain damage from football concussions varies by position and career duration," (Reuters Health) - Football players may experience different degrees of brain damage after concussions depending on what position they play and how long they stick with the sport, a small U.S. study suggests.    Researchers examined data from brain scans of 61 former college and professional football players who didn’t have any symptoms of cognitive impairment. One technique, known as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), looked at the structural integrity of white matter, which connects different parts of the brain; the other test, known as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), measured brain function while participants competed memory tasks.   Former college players with three or more concussions had more extensive white matter damage than their counterparts with one concussion or less, researchers report in the journal Radiology. But the opposite was true for athletes who went on to play professionally.    “Our findings suggest that a career with additional exposure to football is not necessarily worse than a shorter duration of exposure,” said senior study author Kevin Guskiewicz, research director of the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.   “In addition to imaging findings, there were no differences on standard cognitive tests between those players with a longer career compared to those with a shorter career,” Guskiewicz told Reuters Health by email.    One of the most vexing issues with treating concussions in athletes is that the full extent of brain injuries can be difficult to assess while players are still alive. In particular, a condition tied to sports concussions known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can only be diagnosed during an autopsy.   Most previous research on head injuries in football has focused on former athletes with cognitive impairment.    For the current study, researchers focused instead on former players who appeared cognitively healthy to see if imaging scans might reveal differences in brain damage based on the position played or the length of their careers.    Roughly half of the study participants played only college football and half continued on to the National Football League (NFL).   Half of the former players reported three or more prior concussions, while the other half reported one or no prior concussions.    Roughly half of the participants were offensive or defensive linemen, so-called non-speed positions.    Non-speed players with a history of recurrent concussions had more damage to white matter and less brain activity during memory exercises, the study found. This wasn’t the case for running backs and other speed players, however.    The interactions observed between concussion histories and playing positions suggest there may be important differences in the mechanisms of injury between speed and non-speed players, the researchers conclude.    Offensive backs experience impacts at greater acceleration, for example, while linemen tend to experience a greater overall frequency of impacts and have the greatest proportion of impacts to the front of the helmet.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how the position played or career duration might influence the risk of brain damage after concussions.    It’s also possible that players with longer careers and multiple concussions who don’t develop cognitive damage by middle age may differ from former athletes who develop cognitive problems.   “Constant banging of heads in the non-speed positions might be just as dangerous as a few higher-speed type collisions that occur at the speed positions,” said Jonathan Godbout, a neuroscience researcher at the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center in Columbus who wasn’t involved in the study.    “That’s scary because these subthreshold injuries would be very difficult to detect,” Godbout said by email.   "
2Ad59yA,2017-11-30,The doctor will see you now - but often not for long," (Reuters Health) - For half of the world’s population, primary care doctor visits last less than five minutes, researchers say.   Appointments range from 48 seconds in Bangladesh to 22.5 minutes in Sweden. In the U.S., meetings with doctors average about 20 minutes.   Shorter consultation times have been linked to poorer health for patients and burnout for doctors, Dr. Greg Irving of the University of Cambridge in the UK and his colleagues note in a report in BMJ Open.   The researchers reviewed 178 earlier studies written in English, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian or Spanish, covering 67 countries and more than 28.5 million appointments.    Eighteen countries, which account for half the world’s population, have appointment times less than 5 minutes, they found. Another 25 countries had appointment times under 10 minutes.   In developed countries, consultation times seem to be increasing. In the U.S., for example, appointments are bumping up 12 seconds a year and have moved from 15 to 20 minutes over a short period of time.   With longer appointments, “you see more health promotion and conversation with patients,” Irving said.   “The next question is whether patient satisfaction goes up, too,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “Even if you have 30-40 minute appointments, there’s no guarantee patients will be happy.”   Consultation length seemed to drop in low- and middle-income countries, which may have implications for population growth and treatment options. China, for instance, averages around two minutes for appointments. The government recently announced a new policy to expand the primary care workforce.   Future studies should look at the added value for each additional minute of consultation, Irving said. The differences between a two-minute appointment and a 20-minute appointment may be obvious, but researchers want to know the difference between what is covered in a 15-minute versus a 20-minute appointment.   “At what point do qualities such as health promotion begin to creep into the consultation?” he said. “What times help us best manage our patients’ health?”   Irving’s team found that consultation length was associated with national health care spending, the number of primary care doctors per 1,000 residents, and doctor burnout rates. At the same time, appointment length wasn’t associated with the number of consultations per patient each year, the number of diagnostic tests requested by the doctor, the number of emergency care department visits, or patient satisfaction.    The correlations between consultation times and outcomes may become increasingly important as the industrialized countries’ populations age, said Robin Osborn of the Commonwealth Fund in New York City. Osborn, who wasn’t involved with this study, and colleagues conducted a study with primary care physicians in 20 countries in 2015 that looked at the challenges of caring for patients with increasingly complex health needs.   To ensure affordable, high-quality health care for sick and complex patients, a strong primary care infrastructure is needed, she told Reuters Health.   "
2AKqeBi,2017-11-30,Epidurals with fentanyl not linked to lower odds of breastfeeding," (Reuters Health) - Women who get epidural pain relief that includes the opioid fentanyl are no less likely to breastfeed their babies than mothers who get epidurals without this drug, a small study suggests.    Epidurals often contain a combination of fentanyl and a local anesthetic such as bupivacaine because using the combination allows doctors to give women lower doses of each drug. Some previous research suggests that fentanyl, particularly in higher doses, may make it harder for newborns to breastfeed because it crosses from mothers to babies through the placenta and can cause sleepiness and feeding difficulties for the infants.    For the current study, researchers tested different epidural solutions in 345 pregnant women who had successfully breastfed at least one baby before. The participants were randomly assigned to receive bupivacaine alone or bupivacaine combined with either 1 or 2 micrograms per milliliter of fentanyl.    After six weeks, 97 percent of babies in the bupivacaine-only group were breastfeeding, as were 98 percent of infants with the lower dose of fentanyl and 94 percent of newborns with the higher fentanyl dose.    These differences were too small to rule out the possibility that they were due to chance, researchers report in Anesthesiology.   “We studied women that had previously breastfed and were highly motivated to breastfeed with their current infant,” said study co-author Robert McCarthy, an anesthesiology researcher at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.    “Therefore it is not surprising that the success rate is high,” McCarthy said by email.    It’s possible the results would be different for first-time mothers without any previous experience breastfeeding, or with higher doses of fentanyl, McCarthy added. The study was also done at a so-called “baby friendly” hospital with extra services to support breastfeeding.    “This is a group of mothers that was headed for success,” said Dr. Lydia Furman a researcher at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.    “Whether this is clearly generalizable to all mothers is not completely clear to me though the results are encouraging in that with good support there is no reason to avoid fentanyl among those intending to breastfeed,” Furman, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Pediatricians recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed infants until they’re at least 6 months of age because it can reduce babies’ risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) as well as ear and respiratory infections, allergies, childhood obesity and diabetes.   Mothers can benefit too, with longer periods of breastfeeding linked to lower risks of depression, bone deterioration and certain cancers.   Many women still choose not to breastfeed or stop nursing their babies much sooner, often due to time constraints, returning to work, or being unable to afford breast pumps and other equipment needed to express milk.    The majority of the women in the current study had previously nursed a baby for at least six months, and less than 10 percent of them had stopped nursing before three months.    With a larger group of women, it’s possible that the differences in breastfeeding success based on fentanyl doses in the epidurals might have been big enough to be statistically and clinically meaningful, said Yukiko Washio, a researcher at the University of Delaware in Newark who wasn’t involved in the study.    “As a scientist, it seems that not enough evidence shows that epidural fentanyl is adversely impacting the initiation and duration of breastfeeding among women who are highly motivated to breastfeed with previous breastfeeding experiences at this point,” Washio said by email.    “However, replications of this type of study with more power in a similar cohort and with different cohorts of women are required to confirm that for longer-term breastfeeding outcomes to make any definite recommendation as the standard guideline for patients,” Washio added.

2AgVOnt,2017-11-30,Forecast predicts over half of U.S. children will be obese by age 35," (Reuters Health) - Nearly three in five children in the U.S. today are destined to be obese when they reach their 35th birthday, according to a new projection.   Computer modeling, using current national data, estimated that 57 percent of children ages 2 to 19 in 2016 will be obese by the time they are 35 years old.   To put that in perspective, the current rate of obesity among 35-year-olds is 35 percent to 40 percent, lead study author Zachary Ward of the Center for Health Decision Science at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.   “It seems the excess weight gained in childhood puts kids on a trajectory that persists,” he said, recommending that “children with obesity now could benefit from early intervention” such as a better diet with fewer sugar-laden snacks and improved physical education programs in schools.   Non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics were more likely to be obese than whites and those disparities were already present at age 2, the researchers report in The New England Journal of Medicine.   The estimate comes at a time when obesity rates have stabilized among children ages 6 to 11 and even declined for ages 2 to 5. But rates have continued to rise among older Americans.   About 6 percent of U.S. children, 4.6 million, already have severe obesity, which means a body-mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.    “Severely obese children are at especially high risk for adult obesity,” the study team writes. Their chances of not being obese at age 35 are just 21 percent for 2-year-olds, dropping to about 6 percent for 19-year-olds.   The new analysis was an attempt to predict how a child’s current weight might influence his or her obesity risk in adulthood. It used height and weight data from a nationally representative sample of 41,567 children and adults.   “In some ways, this is a surprising finding just because of the sheer magnitude of the problem,” Ward said. “In other ways, it’s not surprising when you look at how trends in weight gain and obesity have been going over the past 40 years. In some parts of the country, we’re already approaching that level of obesity. But this could be a new normal, the way some trends are going.”   The researchers projected that among obese children, the likelihood that they would continue to be obese by age 35 increased with age. Obese 2-year-olds had a 75 percent chance. Obese 19-year-olds had an 88 percent chance.   Conversely, children who were not obese had a lower risk of being obese at 35, and those odds continued to decline with age - from 58 percent for children at age 2 to 44 percent for 19-year-olds.   “Only those children with a current healthy weight have less than a 50 percent chance of becoming obese by the age of 35 years,” the study team notes.    The research does not examine solutions. But the authors cite a 2015 study in the journal Health Affairs that concluded the three most cost-effective strategies for addressing childhood obesity would be a penny-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, setting nutritional standards for all food sold in schools (outside school meals) and the elimination of the tax subsidy that food companies tap when they advertise unhealthy food to children.

2A0sC5S,2017-11-23,Pre-surgery cognitive screen can flag elderly complications risk," (Reuters Health) - Screening older surgery patients for cognitive impairment can catch undiagnosed problems that raise risk for complications, researchers say.   Among 211 patients over age 65 having elective orthopedic surgeries such as hip or knee replacement, pre-operative screening found that about one quarter had likely cognitive impairment such as undiagnosed dementia.    These patients were at increased risk of post-operative delirium, longer hospital stays and not being discharged to home, the study team reports in Anesthesiology.   “We really don’t do enough in the preoperative space to look at impairment and frailty in geriatric patients. We may test mobility, but we need more subtle measures of the brain,” said lead author Dr. Deborah Culley of Harvard Medical School in Boston.   About one of every three surgical procedures in the U.S. involves a patient aged 65 or older, the study authors write. Although most surgical centers assess an older patient’s physical condition before surgery, some are now beginning to test brain function as well, especially in patients without a history of dementia, they note.    “When you talk with a patient before surgery, you can notice an impairment in this stressful environment,” Culley told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “It’s essentially a cognitive stress test.”   Culley and her colleagues screened patients at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston who were scheduled for an elective hip or knee replacement. They used the Mini-Cog test, which involves a three-item memory recall test. The research team defined patients with low scores of 2 or less on the test’s five-point scale as likely cognitively impaired.    Once the surgery was over, they looked at in-hospital medical complications, hospital length-of-stay and discharge information, such as discharge to a place other than the patient’s home, as well as 30-day emergency room visits and death.   Fifty of the 211 patients, or 24 percent, scored 2 or lower on the pre-surgery test. These patients were more likely than those with higher scores to be older, have a lower education level and poorer physical functioning. These patients were also 37 percent more likely to have a longer hospital stay after the surgery, four times as likely to be discharged to a place other than their home and four and a half times as likely to develop post-operative delirium and confusion, the study found.   “What’s novel about this is we’re looking at the brain now. Since the 1970s we’ve looked at organs such as the heart, lungs and kidney to understand surgery risk, but now we’re looking at the most vital organ,” said Dr. Thomas Robinson of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Denver, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Anesthesiologists are particularly paying attention because they give so much sedation in the operating room,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “Medications have been closely associated with mental function after surgery.”   Future studies should look at different cognitive screening instruments, as well as different types of surgeries and different risk factors that make delirium worse in older patients, the study authors write. Culley said she is now following spine surgery patients, who tend to have higher rates of delirium after surgery.   “I’d like to find an online cognitive screening tool that patients can take before they get to surgery so we have an idea of what’s going on before we’ve scheduled appointments,” she added.    Robinson, who is studying postsurgical pain and ways to block it to reduce delirium, said he sees future studies measuring brain markers for cognitive impairment and identifying high-risk patients sooner to create personalized postoperative recovery instructions.   “It sounds simple, but hospitals still don’t do this well,” he said. “We have guidelines for physical therapy after operation, but we should also implement cognitive therapy.”   “With this screening tool, a daughter of an older patient with some cognitive impairment, for example, could know the likelihood of her parent going home and the higher risk of developing delirium,” Culley said. “A change could be as simple as making sure she’s in the recovery room after surgery to reorient the patient better.”   If patients or family members believe impaired cognition or dementia could be a factor in surgery, they should ask their doctors and surgeons for a plan that will improve postsurgical care, according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Brain Health Initiative.

2zIoEg0,2017-11-23,Pregnant and breastfeeding women travelers underprotected from disease," (Reuters Health) - Pregnant and breastfeeding women who travel to places with high risk of diseases like malaria and yellow fever are less likely than other women travelers to be protected by vaccines and drugs, recent U.S. research suggests.    Lack of information about the safety of some preventive medications and vaccines during pregnancy and breastfeeding may be one reason some patients and doctors avoid them, the study team writes in Obstetrics & Gynecology.   “(There is) a tremendous lack of research in pregnant and breastfeeding women especially related to medication usage and vaccinations,” said Diane L. Spatz of the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing in Philadelphia, who wasn’t involved in the study.    The research team, Stefan H. F. Hagmann of the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children’s Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park and his colleagues, analyzed patient information from Global TravEpiNet, a consortium of U.S. travel clinics that collects data on clinic users planning international travel.   Travel clinics typically specialize in providing advice, immunizations and preventive medications that are needed or recommended for specific foreign destinations.     Other sources, such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), also post travel advisories about disease outbreaks and recommend destination-specific measures.    Pregnant women are more susceptible to certain infectious diseases, including malaria and influenza, and in some cases experience more severe symptoms, the study team writes.   Hagmann’s team compared data on 170 pregnant women,139 breastfeeding women and 1,545 non-pregnant/lactating women who received pre-travel care at 24 Global TravEpiNet member clinics between 2009 and 2014.   They found that most pregnant and breastfeeding women intended to travel to tropical destinations where mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria, dengue, or yellow fever are normally present; and up to one third of pregnant travelers traveled to areas in the Americas, which, since the study was conducted, have experienced chikungunya and Zika virus epidemics.   Most pregnant and breastfeeding women seen during northern hemisphere flu season had been vaccinated against the flu or received a shot during their clinic visit.    Typhoid and hepatitis A were the most commonly administered vaccines to the pregnant and breastfeeding women during clinic visits. Still, these women were about half as likely as nonpregnant, nonbreastfeeding women to get these vaccines during their visit.   Among travelers to countries where malaria is present year-round, about 50 percent of pregnant or breastfeeding women received preventive medications, compared to 73 percent of non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding women.   Despite risky travel destinations, in some cases vaccines and drugs were declined by travelers, or withheld by healthcare practitioners, the study authors note, likely due to limited research on the risks of using certain vaccines, such as those for typhoid and yellow fever, as well as antimicrobial medications, during pregnancy.   “I was not really surprised by any of the study’s findings,” Spatz said. “I am not confident that most women seek specific travel health care before traveling and their primary health care providers may or may not speak to them about these issues.”    Overall, pregnant travelers underused vaccines for typhoid, a potentially life-threatening and increasingly multidrug resistant illness, and hepatitis A, a common infection in poorer countries. Pregnant and breastfeeding travelers also received fewer provisional prescriptions than the comparison group for standby antibiotics to treat diarrhea.    Hagmann did not respond to a request for comments, but the study team acknowledges limitations in its report, notably that the women seen in Global TravEpiNet clinics may not represent all pregnant or breastfeeding women travelers.    There must be increased awareness among providers and travelers of the fact that travel advisories exist, said Dr. Diana E. Ramos of the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “We need to encourage the public to proactively do research on their risk, and if pregnant, the risk to their fetus, if they travel,” Ramos said in an email.  "
2hvSXyq,2017-11-15,Heart failure patients’ odds of hospitalization tied to diabetes," (Reuters Health) - Heart failure patients may be less likely to be hospitalized or die prematurely if they don’t also have diabetes – but even if they do have it, they may still minimize their risk by controlling their blood sugar, a recent study suggests.    Researchers studied nearly 49,000 patients with heart failure, one of the most common reasons older adults go to the hospital. For half of these patients, the research team had more than two and a half years of data.    Over the course of the study, about 26,000 of these patients, or 53 percent, died.    Patients were 24 percent more likely to die during the study when they also had type 2 diabetes, which is tied to aging and obesity and happens when the body can’t properly use insulin to convert sugar, or glucose, into energy.   With diabetes, heart failure patients were also 29 percent more likely to have their first hospitalization during the study period, researchers report in JACC: Heart Failure.    “What was surprising was that both low and high levels of blood glucose were associated with high risk of hospital admission and death, but well-controlled blood sugar levels were associated with a much lower risk,” said lead study author Claire Lawson of the University of Keele in the U.K.   “While diabetes and heart failure are a lethal combination, the study showed that controlling blood sugar levels within a target range and keeping them stable over time can virtually remove the additional risk associated with the diabetes,” Lawson said by email.    Approximately one in five heart failure patients have diabetes, Lawson said.    Heart failure happens when the heart muscle is too weak to effectively pump enough blood through the body. Symptoms can include fatigue, weight gain from fluid retention, shortness of breath and coughing or wheezing. Medications can help strengthen the heart and minimize fluid buildup in the body.   For the study, Lawson and colleagues examined records collected from 2002 to 2014 on people with heart failure in a national patient registry the UK.    Patients with diabetes and dangerously high blood sugar were 75 percent more likely to be hospitalized and 30 percent more likely to die during the study than heart failure patients without diabetes, the study found.    At the same time, diabetics with dangerously low blood sugar were 42 percent more likely to be hospitalized and 29 percent more likely to die.    People with diabetes who didn’t stay on medications to control this condition were also more likely to die or be hospitalized than patients without diabetes.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how diabetes might make hospitalization or an early death more likely for people with heart failure.    Another limitation is that researchers lacked cardiac imaging data that would help pinpoint the exact type and severity of heart failure patients experienced, and this might have influenced the odds of hospitalization or death during the study.    Newer diabetes medications might also change the relationship between diabetes and the risk of hospitalization or death for people with heart failure, said Dr. Paul Hauptman, director of heart failure at Saint Louis University School of Medicine.    It’s possible that diabetes boosts risks for heart failure patients because diabetes can accelerate the development of coronary artery disease and sometimes contribute to what’s known as diabetic cardiomyopathy, a heart muscle disorder, Hauptman, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Even if the reasons for the relationships aren’t clear, it still makes sense for patients with both diabetes and heart failure to work closely with health care providers to monitor and control their blood sugar, said Jennifer Bea, a researcher at the University of Arizona in Tucson who wasn’t involved in the study.    “When heart failure patients also have diabetes, there isn’t one single reason that they are more likely to be hospitalized or die prematurely,” Bea said by email. “There are many and varied possible explanations.”  "
2huSIDD,2017-11-16,Slightly elevated blood sugar not tied to higher risk of heart attack," (Reuters Health) - For people who already have cardiovascular problems, having high blood sugar below the cutoff for diabetes diagnosis doesn’t raise the risk of potentially fatal heart “events,” a recent study suggests.    Diabetes has long been linked to an increased risk of coronary artery disease as well as higher odds of heart attacks, cardiac arrest and what’s known as unstable angina, when plaque in the arteries ruptures and blocks the blood supply to the heart.    Research has been mixed, however, on whether slightly elevated blood sugar that is sometimes called “pre-diabetes” might also increase the risk of these heart issues.    For the current study, researchers examined data on patients already hospitalized for heart attacks or other serious problems that occur when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked. This included 162 people with normal blood sugar, 202 individuals with slightly elevated blood sugar and 183 diabetics.    Compared to people with normal blood sugar, patients with diabetes were more than twice as likely to have a heart attack or other serious blockage over three years of follow-up. People with elevated blood sugar, but not at diabetic levels, had a slightly higher risk of these heart problems, but the difference was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    “Those with pre-diabetes may be at higher risk for coronary artery disease, but not as high as those with diabetes,” said Dr. R. Brandon Stacey of Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.    “This provides further motivation for individuals who are pre-diabetic to change their lifestyle to prevent the development of diabetes,” Stacey, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Past research suggests that between 5 percent and 10 percent of people with blood sugar levels that are above normal will progress to full-blown diabetes each year - but it isn’t “inevitable,” according to the World Health Organization. Studies also indicate that weight loss and lifestyle changes can return blood sugar to normal.   For the current study, researchers looked at ultrasound images to see whether blood sugar levels influenced the development of what’s known as vulnerable plaques, a mixture of fats and white blood cells that accumulate on artery walls. When these plaques break free, they can cause a heart attack or stroke.    Patients with diabetes and slightly elevated blood sugar were no more prone to these plaques than individuals with normal blood sugar, the study team reports in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.    But during the study, roughly 26 percent of the diabetes patients had a heart attack or other major cardiovascular event, compared to roughly 16 percent of those with normal or slightly elevated blood sugar.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how slightly elevated blood sugar might contribute to the risk of serious heart problems.   Another limitation is that researchers didn’t know how long the patients with diabetes had that condition, whose effects on the heart can escalate over time, Dr. Akiko Maehara of Columbia University Medical Center and colleagues note.    It’s also possible that blood sugar tests used in the study didn’t always correctly identify people with slightly elevated blood sugar or full-blown diabetes, said Dr. Muhammad Abdul-Ghani, a researcher at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Patients with diabetes who experience a coronary event should receive a more aggressive treatment for their coronary disease than patients without diabetes,” Abdul-Ghani said by email.    There’s a lot that patients with slightly elevated blood sugar can do to prevent diabetes from developing, said Dr. Melvyn Jones, a researcher at University College London who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Lifestyle, lifestyle, lifestyle - i.e., lose weight, exercise and stop smoking,” Jones said by email. “And if you have pre-diabetes get your blood sugar checked fairly regularly so that if you become diabetic you can do something about it.”  "
2AGOIZ2,2017-11-13,Sex rarely makes heart stop beating," (Reuters Health) - Most people who worry that having sex might stop their heart can probably just relax and enjoy themselves, a new study suggests.    Researchers examined data on 4,557 adults who died from a sudden cardiac arrest, which is essentially a short circuit in the heart’s electrical system. They found just 34 cases linked to sexual activity.    Put another way, less than 1 percent of the deaths from sudden cardiac arrest were related to sex.    “Based on this data we now know that the likelihood of sex being a trigger for sudden cardiac arrest is extremely low,” senior study author Dr. Sumeet Chugh, of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Heart Institute in Los Angeles, said by email.    Chugh and colleagues reported their findings at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions meeting in Anaheim, California, and online in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.   Cardiac arrest involves the abrupt loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness. Unlike a heart attack, which happens when blood flow to a portion of the heart is blocked, cardiac arrest occurs when the heart’s electrical system malfunctions, often due to irregular heart rhythms. Cardiac arrest may occur with no warning and is often fatal if not treated within minutes.   Cardiac arrest results in more than 300,000 deaths each year in the U.S. alone, the researchers say.   For the study, researchers looked at detailed medical reports for all of the adults who died in Portland, Oregon, from 2002 to 2015. They had access to complete medical histories and autopsy records, as well as any information about what patients were doing when the cardiac arrest occurred.    Patients who experienced sudden cardiac arrest linked to sexual activity had higher rates of what’s know as ventricular fibrillation – a serious cardiac rhythm disturbance – and tachycardia, or a higher-than-normal heart rate.    Most of the cases were men with a history of heart disease.     Only about 1 in 100 men and 1 in 1,000 women experience sudden cardiac arrest during sexual activity, the study found.    Patients who had sex before they went into cardiac arrest tended to be about 60 years old on average, compared to around 65 for the patients who were doing other things when their heart stopped beating.    When sex preceded cardiac arrest, survival odds tended to be a bit better. Nearly 20 percent of people survived in sex-related cases, compared to only about 13 percent survival odds for other patients.    Survival often depends on how quickly patients receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), or chest compressions, which can help restore circulation and maintain blood flow to vital organs.   All of the patients in the study had their cardiac arrest witnessed by another person, but less than one third of them received CPR.    Odds of CPR were better, however, in sex-related cases. Roughly 32 percent of patients who had sex-related cardiac arrests received CPR, compared with 27 percent of the other cases.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how sex might contribute to the odds of experiencing or surviving sudden cardiac arrest. Researchers also didn’t report on what type of sexual encounters occurred, making it difficult to determine how strenuous the activity may have been for patients.    Generally, older adults who are healthy enough for sex also probably have healthy blood vessels, said Dr. Venu Menon, a director of the cardiac intensive care unit at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.    When sex-related cases of cardiac arrest do occur, it’s possible the patients might have had undiagnosed or untreated coronary artery disease, Menon, who wasn’t involved in the study, said in a phone interview.    “It would be irresponsible to say every 60 year old out there should start being concerned whether sex might put them at risk,” Menon added. “What it does say is that if you are sexually active you should be conscious of your health and if you have any shortness of breath or chest pain you should see a doctor.”  "
2lUMlyk,2017-11-10,Young people with disabilities more likely to be arrested," (Reuters Health) - More than half of blacks in the U.S. with disabilities will be arrested by the time they reach their late 20s, a new study finds.   In general, people with mental or physical disabilities were 13 percent more likely to be arrested as juveniles or young adults than people free of disability, according to the report in the American Journal of Public Health.    For blacks, disability widened the chances of arrest by 17 percent, and more than 55 percent of blacks with disabilities were arrested by age 28.    Author Erin J. McCauley, a policy analysis and management doctoral student at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, called the arrest rate for blacks with disabilities “horrifyingly high.”    “It almost makes the experience of arrest fundamental to the experience of being black and having a disability, when more than half of the group experiences arrest,” she said in a phone interview.   She called for policies to be changed and interventions to be developed to address increased vulnerabilities facing racial minorities with disabilities. Police training emphasizing de-escalation and minimizing the use of force might better protect vulnerable community members, she said.    Using data from a national survey of nearly 9,000 Americans born between 1980 and 1984, McCauley estimated the cumulative probably of arrest by age 28 for people who considered themselves, or whose parents considered them, disabled. Disabilities ranged from blindness, deafness, missing a body part or having an emotional or learning problem.   Nearly one-third of those surveyed had been arrested by age 28. For those with disabilities, the chances of being arrested rose to 43 percent, but the risk fell disproportionately on young people of color.    Blacks with disabilities were at greatest risk of arrest – nearly double the 28 percent risk of whites with disabilities. More than 46 percent of Hispanics with disabilities could expect to be arrested as children or young adults, the study found.    “The experience of arrest is very high for people with disabilities, especially people of color with disabilities, and steps need to be taken to ameliorate this,” McCauley said.   Dr. Gary Slutkin, an epidemiologist and founder of Cure Violence at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health, told Reuters Health by email that the study supports the view that not every situation requires a law enforcement response; what may be needed instead is a rapid response from the health and social-service sectors of communities.   “Law enforcement may not understand what they see or too rapidly interpret speech or actions,” Slutkin said. “Or they may not have the luxury or be able to take the time to understand what is going on.”   “This is a form of violence that can be cured through understanding . . . and through education and training,” he said.   Though the study describes the problem, it wasn’t designed to explain it.   “We can hint (that) we believe it’s because of racism or structural inequality, but we can’t claim that that is the case based on this data,” McCauley said.

2i2xoWF,2017-11-10,Obesity tied to serious complications after knee injuries," (Reuters Health) - Knee dislocations are becoming more common among obese people, and these patients are more likely than normal-weight individuals to develop blood vessel damage that can lead to amputations, a recent study suggests.    Knee dislocations happen when the patella, or kneecap, slips out of its normal position, often as a result of trauma, intense exercise or physically challenging work. But for obese people, knee dislocations are often due not to trauma or excessive force but to strain from carrying excess body weight.    For the current study, researchers examined data on more than 19,000 knee dislocations from 2000 to 2012, including almost 2,300 injuries sustained by overweight and obese people.    The proportion of patients hospitalized with knee dislocations who were also obese rose from 8 percent at the start of the study period to 19 percent by the end, the study found.    Obese people were also about twice as likely as normal-weight patients to have vascular injury, or blood vessel damage, the study also found.    “The effects of obesity go far beyond the effects on general health that are well known,” said lead study author Dr. Joey Johnson of the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.    Because the study also found the risk of vascular injury rose with increasing degrees of obesity, patients may benefit from losing weight even when they can’t shed enough pounds to stop being obese, Johnson said by email.    Overall, just 1,075 patients, or about 6 percent, had vascular injuries during the study, researchers report in the Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma.   Compared to non-obese patients, people with severe obesity were more than twice as likely to have vascular injury. Patients with less extreme obesity were still 77 percent more likely to have vascular injury than non-obese individuals.    Obese patients also typically had longer and more costly hospital stays than non-obese people.    With a vascular injury, patients were hospitalized for around 15 days, compared to only about 7 days without vascular injury.    Average hospitalization costs were $131,478 for vascular injury cases compared to $60,241 for patients without vascular damage, the study also found.    About 2 percent of obese patients had amputations. This wasn’t meaningfully different from non-obese people after researchers accounted for whether patients had vascular injury.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how obesity directly causes knee dislocations or vascular injuries.    Another limitation is the reliance on billing codes to identify obese patients, which might under-represent the overall rate of obesity in the study, the authors note. Researchers also lacked data on long-term patient outcomes.    Even so, the findings add to evidence that knee dislocations and vascular damage can be worse for obese individuals, said Dr. Alexandra Gersing, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn’t involved in the study.    While weight loss is a good way to help avoid these issues, even without losing weight there are things people can do, Gersing said by email.   “In obese individuals that are not able to lose weight, knee stability can be increased by increasing the strength of muscles surrounding the knee joint,” Gersing advised. “Knee stability can thereby be improved up to a certain extent in order to prevent knee dislocations and consequently the associated vascular injury.”  "
2jfIcUJ,2017-11-09,Widely used pelvic floor exercise lacks supporting evidence," (Reuters Health) - An abdominal breathing exercise that’s supposed to help women with prolapsed uterus or a type of urinary incontinence has been taught for more than 30 years, but so far there’s little evidence showing it works, researchers say.    Just two studies have tested the effectiveness of adding the hypopressive abdominal technique (AHT) to another physical therapy regimen, and neither experiment found any added benefit, according to the authors of a “discussion” in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.   “Many physical therapists act as gurus and make a fortune on giving courses. Today we have a totally different background, and all should have some scientific background . . . to be able to ask important questions,” coauthor of the discussion Kari Bo, of the Norwegian School of Sports Science in Oslo, told Reuters Health in an email.   Without adequate evidence, clinicians shouldn’t be prescribing the AHT technique over and above traditional pelvic floor muscle training, Bo and his coauthor Saul Martin-Rodriguez of the COLEF physical education training school in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain, conclude.   The hypopressive abdominal technique emphasizes breathing and attention to posture, they write. The goal is to activate pelvic floor muscles as well as a major muscle of the stomach called the transverse abdominis. Clinicians behind the technique theorize that this decreases overall abdominal pressure, which should help reduce what’s known as stress urinary incontinence as well as pelvic organ prolapse.    But it’s possible this exercise could worsen certain conditions, especially those involving overactive pelvic pain, according to Amy Stein, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “For overactive pelvic pain, you should be relaxing the pelvic floor, but AHT is saying to engage the pelvic floor,” said Stein, founder of Beyond Basics Physical Therapy in New York and president of the International Pelvic Pain Society.   “In overactive patients, the muscles are already shortened and this would further shorten them. In fact, if you engage the pelvic floor too much, this could lead to further pelvic floor dysfunctions such as an underactive pelvis, back issues and abdominal pain,” Stein told Reuters Health in a phone interview.     Pelvic floor muscle training does include some pelvic floor contraction. But the relaxation phase of the exercise is equally important, she noted.   The abdominal hypopressive technique, first developed in the 1980s, remains widely used across Europe, Canada and South America, and is gaining popularity in the U.S. - mainly because of its strong social media presence designed to attract practitioners to pursue “AHT certification,” Bo said.   In the end, the responsibility falls on the individual practitioner to stay current with the scientific literature in order to provide the best possible treatment for their patients, he said. Hype, theory or a strong marketing campaign is not considered an appropriate rationale for prescribing treatment.    “There is strong evidence that pelvic floor muscle training is effective in both stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. We must anticipate that clinicians are updated on these studies and follow protocols that have shown effects are based on a biological rationale and, in addition, years of clinical experience,” Bo added.   “Clinicians who are not up to date and who prescribe non-evidence (based) treatments are violating the responsibility they have to their patients,” Martin-Rodriguez said by email.

2yL0jZO,2017-11-09,"Women’s menopause complaints may peak in early 50s, improve later"," (Reuters Health) - Menopause symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats have the biggest impact on quality of life for women in their early-to-mid-50s, a small U.S. study suggests.    Women age 60 or older had better overall quality of life scores and fewer complaints about memory problems and physical symptoms, researchers report in Maturitas, but they still had issues like sexual dysfunction, fatigue and mood swings.    “This study emphasizes the need for clinicians to initiate conversations with women about sexual health and psychosocial changes associated with aging,” said senior study author Dr. Carolyn Torkelson of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.   “Women are living healthy, productive lives many years beyond menopause, thereby creating a demand for services that are unique to this population,” Torkelson said by email.   Women go through menopause when they stop menstruating, which typically happens between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterwards, women can experience symptoms ranging from vaginal dryness to mood swings, joint pain, memory trouble and insomnia.   For the study, researchers examined data from questionnaires completed by 932 women in Minnesota who were part of a larger trial examining whether green tea extract influences the odds of developing breast cancer.    Women in the study were about 60 years old on average. Most of them were white, and they were typically a healthy weight or just slightly overweight.    Overall, participants under age 55 reported more night sweats and hot flashes than their older counterparts.    These younger women in the study also reported increased severity of changes in sexual desire.    Older women, meanwhile, reported less severe symptoms for physical problems like fatigue, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and changes in appearance.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how menopause symptoms impact quality of life.    Beyond its small size and the lack of racial and ethnic diversity among the study participants, another drawback is that participants were typically healthier and better educated than the average U.S. woman.    While these limitations mean the results may not apply to a more diverse population of women, the findings still add to the evidence that menopause can impact quality of life, said Dr. Susan Davis, a researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It is well established that menopausal symptoms peak during the early postmenopausal years,” Davis said by email.    Given the broad variety of ways that menopause and aging can impact women’s daily lives, it’s essential for doctors to ask patients directly about symptoms that patients may not necessarily bring up like sexual dysfunction or bladder issues, said Dr. Mary Jane Minkin, a researcher at Yale Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Most women do associate hot flashes with menopause, and some blame just about everything on menopause, like a 40-pound weight gain, which is highly unlikely to be a strictly menopausal issue,” Minkin said by email.    “Most surveys show that most women do not talk about vaginal dryness, which is a significant issue for most women,” Minkin added. “And unfortunately, associated with the vaginal dryness are bladder symptoms, like recurrent urinary tract infections, which neither the patient nor the provider often associate with menopause.”  "
2h5QjyQ,2017-11-08,"Heart valve replacement success may depend on age, valve type"," (Reuters Health) - People who need a heart valve replaced often face a dilemma: should they have a mechanical valve made of graphite or a biological valve derived from a cow or pig? A new study suggests the answer depends on the age of the patient and which of the heart’s valves needs to be replaced.   About 2.5 percent of the U.S. population may need valve replacement. Biologic valves are more prone to deterioration and may require a second operation. Mechanical valves last longer, but patients have to take a blood thinner for life to prevent dangerous clots and bleeding.   The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association currently recommend mechanical valves for people under age 50 and biologic valves for those over 70. Between those ages, the groups say, neither type has a clear advantage.   But the new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which used death rates for 25,445 replacement surgeries in California from 1996 through 2013, found that it makes a difference whether patients need a mitral valve, which leads to the main pumping chamber of the heart, or an aortic valve, which regulates blood coming out of the heart.   “With aortic valves, our findings pretty much mirrored what the guidelines suggest or might actually support an earlier age for putting in biological valves,” senior study author Dr. Joseph Woo, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “For the mitral valve it was the exact opposite.”   The issues are complicated, however, by the question of whether most mitral valves really need to be replaced as well as the lifestyle limitations brought on by mechanical valves, said Dr. Robert Bonow, a past president of the American Heart Association who helped write the current guidelines but was not involved in the new study.   For example, when it came to mitral valves, Woo and his colleagues found that a pig or cow valve more than doubled the risk of death within 30 days for patients aged 40 to 49. The death rate was 5.6 percent with a biologic valve versus 2.2 percent with a mechanical one. Yet with older patients, the type of device didn’t seem to make a difference in mortality risk.   Over the longer term, younger recipients of a biologic valve also fared worse. In the 40 to 49 age group, the death rate at 15 years was 44.1 percent with a biologic valve and 27.1 percent with a mechanical valve. In the 50- to 69-year-old patients, the added risk associated with a biologic valve was not as high while in older patients there was no difference.   The odds of stroke were also higher among people who had mechanical mitral valve replacements, but only in the 50 to 69 age group. The risk of bleeding was lower among mitral valve patients with a biologic valve if they were aged 50 to 79.   Yet in reality, most mitral valves should be repaired, not replaced, said Bonow, who directs the Center for Cardiovascular Innovation at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.   “If you’re going to get a mitral valve replacement, it’s better with a mechanical valve,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “But even better, let’s get a surgeon who can repair it. Not every mitral valve can be repaired, but the majority can.”   Surgeons often prefer replacement because it requires less expertise than re-tailoring an existing valve to keep it from leaking.   When it came to aortic valve replacement, the type of valve used did not affect overall mortality. But age at the time of replacement did.   “It’s only marginally better to get a mechanical valve” if you’re 45 to 54, Bonow said, but dealing with the fallout of getting a mechanical valve poses “huge lifestyle issues,” because recipients have to be on a blood thinner for the rest of their lives.    “A lot of times, once you describe the lifestyle issues, people will usually opt for the biological valve.”   That may explain why the Woo team found that biologic valves became increasingly popular during the study period, representing 51.6 percent of the cases of aortic-valve replacements in recent years versus 11.5 percent in 1996. Similarly, with mitral valves, the share of biologic prostheses went from 16.8 percent in 1996 to 53.7 percent in 2013.   Woo acknowledged that the new findings don’t make decision-making easier for patients and their doctors. The results add nuances to the recommendations, he said.   "
2zEAR8k,2017-11-07,Parental exposure to hazardous agents tied to eye tumors in offspring," (Reuters Health) - Parents’ exposure to chemicals at work might be linked to eye cancer in their children, a report from some of the world’s leading childhood cancer experts suggests.    The cancer is called retinoblastoma, because it starts in the retina, the back part of the eye. Retinoblastoma accounts for about 6 percent of cancers in children under the age of 5 and about 3 percent of cancers in children under age 15.    “Retinoblastoma is an embryonal tumor, meaning that it arises from tissues of the embryo,” Julia Heck from the Fielding School of Public Health at UCLA told Reuters Health via email. “Six to ten percent of retinoblastoma is ‘familial’ where the child inherits a mutated gene from a parent. The remainder is ‘sporadic’ meaning that these are new mutations that occur in a child’s eye cell, which end up causing the cancer.”   The risk of developing “sporadic” retinoblastoma increased substantially when fathers and mothers were exposed to workplace chemicals such as paints, pesticides, and metals, Heck and her colleagues found.    The research team studied 282 children with sporadic retinoblastoma, plus 155 of the children’s healthy friends, as well as all the parents.    Fathers were asked to report all jobs held in the ten years prior to conception. Mothers reported jobs held the month prior to conception in addition to any jobs they had while pregnant. The researchers then assigned an overall “exposure” score to each job with regards to nine hazardous agents.    Results showed that children of fathers who were exposed to workplace paint in the past ten years were more than eight times more likely to have retinoblastoma than children whose fathers were not exposed. Fathers who were at least 30 years old when they were exposed to at least one of the nine agents had a nearly seven times higher risk of having a child diagnosed with retinoblastoma.   Mothers’ exposure to at least one of the nine hazardous agents in the month prior to conception or during pregnancy was associated with more than five times higher odds that their child would have retinoblastoma.   The research was done by the Children’s Oncology Group, a National Cancer Institute-backed coalition devoted exclusively to researching and understanding cancers in youngsters. The entire report can be found online in Occupational and Environmental Medicine.    Exposure to chemical agents including welding fumes, sulfur dioxides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is rampant among workers in agriculture, coal mining, and aluminum reduction. These agents have previously been associated with an increased risk of childhood brain cancers and leukemia.    Although the most common eye cancer in children, retinoblastoma is very rare, with just one in every 200,000 births.    “Only 200 to 300 children are diagnosed each year in the U.S.,” Greta Bunin from Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, who worked on the study, told Reuters by email.    Nonetheless, couples actively trying to conceive should be aware of the potential connection and, if possible, ask for a temporary reassignment from employers to avoid further exposure, at least in the short-term.    What measures should be taken from an occupational or environmental policy standpoint to lessen the risks? From a policy perspective, prevention might not be so easy.   “Of course this cancer is rare and some may argue that it is hard to make broad policies to impact the incidence of such a rare disease,” Heck acknowledged. “I would say that our study contributes to the literature examining the health risks in workers and their offspring from occupational chemical exposures and provides another reason to suggest that protections are taken.”   "
2ztBfU6,2017-11-08,Exercise tied to lower odds of premature death with type 1 diabetes," (Reuters Health) - People with type 1 diabetes who exercise - and the more the better - are less likely to die prematurely than their sedentary counterparts, a recent study suggests.    Researchers examined data on the frequency, intensity and duration of leisure time physical activity for 2,639 patients with type 1 diabetes in Finland. After an average follow-up of about 11 years, 270 participants died.    Compared to the people who spent little or no time exercising, participants who reported devoting the most time to physical activity were less likely to die during the study, even when they had kidney disease.        “It matters because doctors have always prescribed physical activity for their patients with (type 1) diabetes without strong evidence,” said lead study author Dr. Heidi Tikkanen-Dolenc of the University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital.   Exercise has long been linked to better survival odds and fewer complications for people with what’s known as type 2 diabetes, the more common form of the disease that’s tied to obesity and aging. Type 2 diabetes develops when the body can’t properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to help convert blood sugar into energy.    But it’s been less clear how exercise influences longevity for patients with type 1 diabetes, which happens when the body doesn’t make insulin and is usually diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood.   Left untreated, both types of diabetes can lead to nerve damage, kidney damage known as nephropathy, and complications in the heart, blood vessels and eyes. Often, people with diabetes eventually die of heart or kidney disease.   “Now we can say that in patients with type 1 diabetes, physical activity not only reduces the risk of diabetic nephropathy and cardiovascular disease events but also premature mortality,” Tikkanen-Dolenc said by email.    At the start of the study, patients were 40 years old on average and most were overweight.    Researchers asked the participants how often they exercised, and how intensely, as well as what activities they did. Then, the study team scored participants’ exercise levels and intensity based on a measure known as metabolic equivalent of task (MET) hours per week.    The least active group got less than 10 MET hours per week when they joined the study, while the most active group got more than 40 MET hours a week.    Over 10 years, the death rate for the least active group was 14.4 percent, compared with 4.8 percent for the most active group, researchers calculated.    After adjusting for other factors like current or former smoking, cholesterol, body mass, blood sugar control and age at onset of diabetes, the researchers found that people who got less than 10 MET hours of activity a week were nearly twice as likely as those who got more than 40 MET hours to die of any cause. People in the moderate exercise group were 37 percent more likely to die than the most active people.    Physical activity appeared to benefit patients both with or without kidney disease, the study team notes.    One limitation of the results is that researchers only assessed activity levels once, at the start, and it’s possible that people’s habits changed over time, the authors write. The study also wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how exercise might improve survival odds.    It’s possible, however, that exercise helps reduce the odds of death from heart or kidney problems by reducing body weight, improving physical fitness levels and helping the body respond better to insulin, Tikkanen-Dolenc said.    “While the exact amount of exercise needed to lower the risk of cardiovascular events is unknown, doing any is better than remaining sedentary,” said Sheri Colberg, a professor emeritus of exercise science at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.   “As in people without diabetes, intense activity likely is even more cardioprotective than moderate or light activity,” Colberg, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “But since the exercise is this study was self-reported and only collected at the start of the study, it is hard to draw definitive conclusions about how much exercise is needed and how intense it should be to reduce mortality risk.”  "
2zc1eCt,2017-11-06,"Refugees lack menstrual supplies and private, safe toilets"," (Reuters Health) - Girls and women forced to flee their homes in Myanmar and Syria lack menstruation supplies and safe, private toilets, a new study finds.   In 2015, researchers interviewed emergency-response staff and about 150 females from two groups receiving humanitarian aid – Syrian Muslim refugees living in tents and makeshift structures across Lebanon and internally displaced adolescent girls and women living in camps in Myanmar – about their menstruation needs.   A basic part of life for females, menstruation has been a neglected challenge for an estimated 30 million girls and women displaced due to worldwide conflicts and disasters, said Marni Sommer, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health in New York.   “It has been an overlooked issue,” Sommer said in a phone interview. “People say this is not life or death, so why should we pay attention to this?”   She is paying attention because girls skip school and other activities when they lack menstruation supplies and facilities in which to change.   Displaced females in Myanmar described shared latrines in camps as unsafe, uncomfortable, dirty, without water or door locks, just bamboo walls with gaps through which intruders could peer inside, according to the report by Sommer’s team in the journal Conflict and Health.   Poorly lit paths made it difficult for girls and women to find toilets at night. Moreover, they avoided using them after dark for fear of being assaulted, kidnapped or bitten by snakes, researchers learned.   Refugee girls in Lebanon described the toilets as cramped and dirty and said they preferred to change their menstrual materials in their shelters, though the shelters provided no privacy.    “The walls that make the tents and separate them are normally just blankets, plastic sheeting and transparent,” said one adolescent girl from Lebanon. “Someone from the outside can see you in there.”    Emergency workers and the girls and women told researchers that they had not been adequately consulted about menstruation practices and preferences.    “It really is essential that you talk to women and girls,” Sommer said. “They just need to be consulted.”   Regular provision of disposable pads and cloths presented a challenge in both Myanmar and Lebanon, researchers found. But the challenges went beyond menstruation supplies to facilities and who should lead an effort to assist females with their periods.    Interviews of girls in refugee camps in Myanmar revealed they rarely were educated about menstruation, leading to distress and embarrassment at the onset of bleeding, the report found.    Syrian adolescent girls reported more basic knowledge about menstruation before getting their first periods. But not everything they were taught was true. One misconception, for example, was believing they could not shower while menstruating, researchers learned.   Bethany Caruso, a postdoctoral fellow in environmental health at Emory University in Atlanta who was not involved with the research, described it as an overdue assessment of the female refugee experience.    “These are girls coming to age and having their periods for the first time in an emergency setting, which makes it all the more complicated,” she said in a phone interview.   “Amidst all the things to think about, all the things that need to be done, where does this fall?” she asked.    For Caruso, it’s a priority.   She agreed with the researchers that aid workers should ask displaced girls and women about their menstruation needs, and not just about whether they prefer cloth or disposable pads.   “There’s always this focus on pads, but there’s so much more that women and girls need at this time,” Caruso said. “Pads are an inexpensive, tangible good that people can distribute with a fair amount of ease. But the provision of safe and secure spaces for changes is a lot harder to come by and create.”   “They need to have privacy, safety, security. They need access to water and soap,” she said.   She also stressed the need for aid groups to coordinate work on menstruation needs and for identification of which group should take the lead in addressing the issue.   “It seems like people want to respond well,” she said. “They just don’t know how.”   "
2lHbBYO,2017-11-02,Labor lying down tied to higher odds of giving birth without interventions," (Reuters Health) - First-time mothers who have an epidural are more likely to have a vaginal birth without forceps or other interventions if they’re lying down rather than upright during labor, a UK study suggests.    Researchers examined data on 3,093 women who had babies at 41 hospitals from 2010 to 2014. Women were randomly assigned to labor either lying down or upright.    Overall, 41 percent of the mothers who labored lying down had what’s known as a spontaneous vaginal birth, when the baby emerges without assistance from tools like forceps or a vacuum and a surgical cesarean delivery isn’t needed. That compares to 35 percent of the women who labored in an upright position.    “Lying down compared with being upright, increases a woman’s chances of having a spontaneous vaginal birth,” said study author Dr. Peter Brocklehurst of the University of Birmingham.   “This matters both to women and babies because avoiding instrumental births, whether with forceps or (vacuum extraction) or a cesarean section in the late stage of labor, avoids any of the traumas, both short term and long term, which follow from these interventions,” Brocklehurst said by email.    Roughly 30 percent of women in the UK choose spinal anesthesia known as an epidural during labor, and this method of pain relief is associated with longer labor and higher odds that tools or surgery will be required, researchers note in The BMJ.    Some previous research also suggests that the position women are in during the second stage of labor, when the cervix is fully dilated and it’s time to push, may independently influence their odds of having a spontaneous vaginal birth.    “We do not clearly understand how the lying down position increases the chances of a spontaneous vaginal birth,” Brocklehurst said.    It’s possible that when women are upright during the second stage of labor, swelling of tissues below the baby’s head in the birth canal might make it harder for women to push babies out, he said. It’s also possible that when women are lying down, contractions may be more productive at helping the baby emerge from the birth canal.    In the study, there was an almost 6 percent absolute increase in the chance of a spontaneous vaginal birth when women were lying down during labor.    Women were slightly more likely to have deliveries assisted by forceps or other instruments, a C-section delivery, or tearing or other injuries during delivery when they were upright, but the differences were too small to rule out the possibility that they were due to chance.    One limitation of the study is that more women stuck with their assigned labor position in the upright group than the lying down group, researchers note. This may be due in part to current guidelines in the UK that encourage women to be upright during labor, and it may mean the results underestimate the benefits of lying down.    The study findings are surprising because many clinicians believe that the added effects of gravity, along with being better able to tilt one’s pelvis, make delivery easier from an upright position, said Dr. Philip Hess, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and director of obstetric anesthesia at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.   “This study goes against that belief,” Hess, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “This matters for patients because not all patients find squatting to be easy,” Hess added. “This is especially true if they are receiving denser epidural pain relief that decreases the strength in the woman’s legs.”   Based on the results, women should feel free to choose a labor position that makes the most sense in their individual situation, he said.    “Patients should be in a comfortable position for them during the second stage, and patients should not be forced to remain upright if it is challenging or uncomfortable,” Hess continued. “Being upright for some time can still be beneficial, but it’s ok to lie down for the delivery.”  "
2lHyHP3,2017-11-02,Brain training games may help older adults with hearing loss," (Reuters Health) - Hearing-impaired adults who play computer games designed to improve audio skills may have an easier time understanding conversations in a noisy room, a small experiment suggests.    Researchers asked 24 elderly adults who used hearing aids to spend 3.5 hours a week for eight weeks playing computer games. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to play games designed to help improve their ability to follow conversations, while the other half played games focused on memory that weren’t intended to help their hearing skills.    People playing memory games didn’t improve their ability to make out words during conversations. But participants in the other group did improve, correctly identifying 25 percent more words in spoken sentences after playing the games.    “The use of auditory perceptual training is fairly well established in training individuals to cope with tinnitus and to assist hearing impaired patients (especially the elderly) to hear and process speech more efficiently noisy situations,” said Dr. Allen Senne, an audiologist at the House Ear Clinic in Los Angeles who wasn’t involved in the study.    “The training is based on the theory of neural plasticity and the ability to train or ‘remap’ the neural connections in the brain to deal with either tinnitus, or background noise,” Senne said by email.    For many people with hearing challenges, trying to follow a conversation in a crowded restaurant or other noisy venue is a major struggle, even with hearing aids.   Study participants were 70 years old on average and had been using hearing aids for around seven years.    All of the computer games they played required them to construct jigsaw puzzles using a touchscreen tablet.    People in the memory group had to use word recall to assemble the puzzles, while individuals in the other group had to rely on subtle changes in sounds to complete the puzzles.    Participants didn’t know which group they had been assigned to, and neither did researchers evaluating their listening comprehension skills after they played the games.    People in both groups improved on their respective auditory tasks and had comparable expectations for improved speech processing.   Among people who played the audio games, higher scores were associated with bigger gains in speech comprehension, the study found.    But the benefits didn’t last. Testing seven weeks after participants stopped playing the audio games revealed that their improved ability to understand spoken words in a noisy room had gone away.    Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include a lack of data to show whether this type of computer game might benefit people in real life, lead author Jonathon Whitton of Harvard University in Boston and colleagues note in Current Biology.    Whitton did not respond to requests for comment.    Some participants also did worse after playing the games than they did before, and it’s unclear why this happened.    Even so, the idea of brain training games to aid people with hearing loss has long drawn interest from clinicians and there are a variety of commercially available programs that patients can try, noted Colleen Le Prell, a researcher at the University of Texas at Dallas who wasn’t involved in the study.    “There are no ‘back-to-back’ studies comparing outcomes with the different training programs, and the level of evidence for most training programs is generally rather limited,” Le Prell said by email. “However, given a number of studies potentially suggesting benefit of various training program, it is possible that an individual who is willing to make a commitment to regular training (defined by some as 30 minutes per day, 5 days per week, for at least one month) might obtain some benefit.”  "
2hwFlmS,2017-11-01,U.S. states adding rules for feeding babies in daycare," (Reuters Health) - Most U.S. states have added new rules over the past decade designed to improve feeding practices for babies in daycare, a study suggests.    Babies who don’t learn to eat only when they’re hungry can have an increased risk of obesity, and excessive weight gain during infancy is also associated with a higher risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure later in life, researchers note in Pediatrics. Practices like too many feedings, oversize bottles, or what’s known as bottle propping, or giving a baby a bottle by leaning it on a pillow or support instead of holding it, can all encourage babies to eat too much.    As of 2008, the majority of states required child care providers to hold babies during feedings and to follow plans for giving infants bottles, but the rules often didn’t apply to family-based child care and few states had other infant feeding regulations, researchers report.    By 2016, however, nearly all states had updated their regulations to encourage feeding practices that do things like support breastfeeding and discourage over-feeding, the study found.    “Most parents share the responsibility for feeding their infants with another caregiver – the child care provider,” said lead study author Sara Benjamin-Neelon of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.   “In our review, we found that more states now require a feeding plan for infants from the parent or a physician,” Benjamin-Neelon said by email. “A feeding plan ensures that parents and providers are on the same page about what to feed and when to feed infants in care.”   Good communication between parents and child care providers can, for example, prevent breastfed babies from receiving a bottle right before they’re picked up at the end of the day. If babies are hungry when they’re picked up, it’s easier for mothers to breastfeed their infants, Benjamin-Neelon said.    “Child care providers can help ensure that mothers and infants continue to breastfeed successfully,” Benjamin-Neelon added. “State regulations can help make sure that happens by guiding infant feeding practices.”   Pediatricians recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed infants until they’re at least six months of age because it can reduce babies’ risk of SIDS as well as ear and respiratory infections, allergies, childhood obesity and diabetes.   In addition, pediatricians advise parents to feed babies on demand in response to crying or other hunger cues. This practice can help parents avoid giving infants too much to eat and can encourage babies to eat only when hungry. The advice is harder to follow at daycare, however, when providers may struggle to have a routine for all of the kids while feeding individual infants at different times.    For the study, researchers looked at changes over time in state regulations covering 10 infant feeding standards at daycare centers. These include supporting breastfeeding and having a feeding plan as well as things like avoiding solid foods before 6 months of age and cow’s milk before 12 months, holding babies while they eat, and not permitting babies to carry or sleep with bottles.    Delaware was the only state with regulations meeting 9 of the 10 standards for daycare providers in 2008.   By 2016, all but one state required babies to be held during feedings, 41 states required feeding plans, 31 states didn’t allow babies to carry or sleep with bottles, and 25 states required feeding on demand.   One limitation of the study is the lack of data on how rigorously these regulations are followed or enforced, researchers note.    Even so, parents should be aware that most states have rules in place and do their homework, said Myles Faith, a researcher at the University at Buffalo in New York who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Many parents might not know expert feeding guidelines exist for early care and education (ECE) settings and that facilities are expected to be compliant,” Faith said by email.    “Parents can also ask if they or physicians can provide a feeding plan for their own infant, which is one of the recommended guidelines,” Faith added. “These can be empowering conversations for caregivers making such important decisions.”  "
2zXWlcp,2017-10-31,Older patients having a heart attack often delay hospital trip," (Reuters Health) - A significant proportion of older people having heart attacks put off going to a hospital, a recent study found.   Many of these patients waited six hours or more, the study authors wrote in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.   “The time that the heart is lacking much-needed oxygen also includes the pre-hospital period, from the onset of symptoms to arriving for medical care,” said study author Dr. Gregory Ouellet of Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, in email to Reuters Health.   To improve heart attack outcomes, people need to be thinking about the time before the patient gets to the hospital, and not just the care in the hospital, Ouellet said.   Ouellet and colleagues analyzed data on 2,500 patients over age 75 who visited hospitals for heart attacks. They found that 1,053 patients, or 42 percent, experienced six or more hours of prehospital delay. These patients were more likely to be nonwhite, to have heart failure, and to have confusing symptoms that didn’t include chest pain. Overall, 21 percent experienced atypical symptoms - such as shortness of breath, weakness or fatigue, shoulder or arm pain, indigestion and nausea – without chest pain.   “The finding that atypical symptoms is associated with delay makes good intuitive sense and could easily help to form a public health campaign similar to what has been done to raise awareness of heart attack symptoms in women,” Ouellet said.   Women having a heart attack, for example, tend to experience symptoms such as arm pain, jaw pain, lightheadedness and fatigue.    A public health campaign targeting older patients could clear up misconceptions about what’s just indigestion and what’s not, said Dr. Robert Goldberg of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts. Goldberg, who wasn’t involved with this study, researches pre-hospital delay and its related factors in Boston-area patients.   “Studies have shown that patients who come to the hospital beyond the 8- to 12-hour mark are less likely to be treated aggressively because of the extent of the muscle damage,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “When patients come earlier, physicians feel they can do more.”   The study authors cautioned against applying the results to patients who differ dramatically from those in the evaluation. For instance, 95 percent of the participants in this study lived within 30 miles of a hospital. Hospital delay may differ significantly for rural patients who live in isolated areas. This group also had a low level of disability, whereas those with significant functional limitations may face different difficulties with hospital delay.   “It’s important for the public, whether elderly or not, to know the signs and symptoms of a heart attack and try to seek care as quickly as possible,” Goldberg said. “When treated quickly, both acute and long-term prognosis can be excellent.”  "
2zWTMXY,2017-10-31,Can spicy foods curb salt cravings or lower blood pressure?," (Reuters Health) - People who like spicy foods may eat less salt and have lower blood pressure, potentially reducing their risk of heart attacks and strokes, a study from China suggests.    When people didn’t care for spicy food, they consumed an average of 13.4 grams a day of salt, according to the study published in the journal Hypertension. But when people craved spicy dishes, their average salt intake was just 10.3 grams a day.    Systolic blood pressure – the “top” number showing how much pressure blood exerts against artery walls when the heart beats, was 8 mmHg (millimeters of mercury) lower for people with the greatest love of spicy foods than for individuals with the lowest tolerance for spice, the study also found. Diastolic blood pressure – the “bottom” number indicating how much pressure the blood exerts on artery walls when the heart is at rest between beats – was 5 mmHg lower for spice lovers.    “Our study shows that the enjoyment of spicy flavor is an important way to reduce salt intake and blood pressure, no matter the type of food and the amount of food,” said senior study author Dr. Zhiming Zhu of Third Military Medical University in Chongqing, China.   “We advise people to enjoy spicy food in their daily life as long as they can tolerate,” Zhu said by email. “We do not recommend people who can’t tolerate pungent of chili pepper consume spicy food frequently.”   A high-salt diet has long been linked to higher odds of developing high blood pressure and heart disease as well as an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure. But determining the ideal amount of dietary salt is controversial because some research has also found an elevated risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and heart attacks in otherwise healthy people who consume too little salt.   Some previous research suggests that trace amounts of capsaicin, the chemical that gives chili peppers their pungent smell, may heighten salty flavors in foods, essentially requiring lower amount of salt to achieve the flavor people may want, Zhu said by email.    For the current study, researchers wanted to see if this heightened awareness of salty flavors in food might translate into lower salt intake, Zhu said.    Researchers also used imaging techniques to look at two regions of the participants’ brains — the insula and orbitofrontal cortex — known to be involved in salty taste.    They found that the areas stimulated by salt and spice overlapped, and that spice further increased brain activity in areas activated by salt. Authors said that this increased activity likely makes people more sensitive to salt so that they can enjoy food with less of it.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how a love of spicy foods might translate into eating less salt or having lower blood pressure.    Another drawback is that researchers relied on surveys to determine how much salt participants consumed, and they didn’t independently verify this, the authors note.    It’s also possible that results from Chinese people might not apply to other racial or ethnic groups in other regions of the world.    “It is impossible to tell from this study which types of spices will be the most beneficial or how much spice is required to see a beneficial effect on lowering salt intake or blood pressure,” said Richard Wainford, author of an accompanying editorial and a pharmacology researcher at Boston University School of Medicine.   “There are no key spices identified in this study,” Wainford said by email. “A good way to think about it is adding a little spice may be beneficial!”  "
2lqilKF,2017-10-30,Breastfeeding at least two months tied to lower SIDS risk," (Reuters Health) - Babies who are breastfed for at least two months may have a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) during sleep than babies who aren’t nursed as long, a research review suggests.    Pediatricians recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed infants until they’re at least six months of age because it can reduce babies’ risk of SIDS as well as ear and respiratory infections, allergies, childhood obesity and diabetes. But research to date hasn’t offered a clear picture of exactly how long women need to nurse their infants to protect against SIDS, said John Thompson, lead author of the current study and a pediatrics researcher at the University of Auckland.   “The peak age of SIDS is two to four months, so breastfeeding may need to continue into this apparently more vulnerable period to incur the protective effect,” Thompson said by email.    SIDS has become much less common in recent decades as doctors have urged parents to put infants to sleep on their backs without pillows or other soft bedding and toys that could pose a suffocation risk. But it still remains a leading cause of infant mortality.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how breastfeeding directly prevents SIDS. However, it’s possible that breast milk helps boost babies’ immune systems and lower the risk of infections that can lead to SIDS, doctors say.    For the study, researchers examined data from eight previously published studies with a total of 2,267 SIDS cases and 6,837 babies who didn’t die in their sleep.    Compared to babies who were not breastfed at all, SIDS was 40 percent less likely in infants who were breastfed at least some of the time for two to four months, researchers report in Pediatrics.    Any breastfeeding for four to six months was associated with a 60 percent lower risk of SIDS, and nursing babies at least some of the time for six months or longer was linked to 64 percent lower odds of SIDS.    Exclusive breastfeeding for less than two months didn’t appear to protect against SIDS. But exclusive breastfeeding for two to four months was associated with 39 percent lower odds of SIDS, and four to six months was linked to 54 percent lower odds.    It’s not clear why breastfeeding didn’t appear to have a protective effect when the duration was less than two months, said Dr. Jeffrey Colvin, a pediatrics researcher at Children’s Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who wasn’t involved in the study.    “We knew that breastfeeding was associated with decreased risk of SIDS and that exclusive breast feeding seemed to impart even greater protection,” Colvin said by email. “I now know the absolute minimum duration of breastfeeding I must reach with every newborn.”   One limitation of the current study, however, is that it’s unclear why exclusive breastfeeding didn’t appear more protective than breastfeeding just some of the time and supplementing with baby formula, the authors note. The smaller studies in the analysis didn’t have information on families’ social and economic status, and this might influence both which babies are exclusively breastfed and which infants get SIDS, the researchers point out.    Parent involvement might also influence breastfeeding and SIDS risk, said Dr. Ian Paul, a researcher at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey who wasn’t involved in the study.    “I believe parent behaviors are paramount in preventing SIDS,” Paul said by email. “Breastfed infants are likely to have more sustained and frequent interactions with their parents during the night at the key ages when SIDS is most likely to occur.”   There are many reasons to breastfeed babies exclusively for six months and then continue nursing them until age one, said Dr. Lori Feldman-Winter, a pediatrics researcher at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, New Jersey, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “SIDS protection is simply one outcome,” Feldman-Winter said by email. “Exclusivity is important for infection protection, obesity prevention, and to decrease diseases linked to autoimmunity, such as Crohn’s. Duration is also important for appropriate growth, continued protection from infections such as gastroenteritis.”   "
2lv69se,2017-10-30,Pain drugs in pregnancy tied to ADHD," (Reuters Health) - Women who use a lot of the common pain reliever acetaminophen during pregnancy may be more likely to have children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) than those who don’t use the drug, a Norwegian study suggests.                    FILE PHOTO: A pregnant woman, in the last trimester of her pregnancy, poses in this illustration photo in Sete, South France, March 26, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau       Researchers analyzed data on almost 113,000 children and their parents, including 2,246 kids who were diagnosed with ADHD. Almost half of the mothers took acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol) at some point during pregnancy, researchers report in Pediatrics.    Using the drug during just one trimester was associated with 7 percent higher odds of having a child with ADHD, while the increased risk was 22 percent for women who used acetaminophen in two trimesters and 27 percent with use in all three trimesters, the study found.     Short-term use didn’t appear to increase the risk for ADHD. In fact, when women took acetaminophen for less than 8 days, they were 10 percent less likely to have kids with ADHD than mothers who didn’t use the drug at all during pregnancy, the study found.    Women used the medicine for fever and infections for 22 to 28 days, however, were more than six times more likely to have kids with ADHD than mothers who avoided the drug during pregnancy.    “Surprisingly, adjusting for all the medical conditions related to acetaminophen use during pregnancy (e.g., infections and pain) and familial genetic risk for ADHD, children exposed to long-term use of acetaminophen use during pregnancy were more than two times more likely to have ADHD diagnosed by a specialist in a clinic,” said lead study author Eivind Ystrom of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the University of Oslo.   “This is important, since more than 50 percent of women in western countries use acetaminophen during pregnancy, a large number of children are also exposed to long term use,” Ystrom said by email.    Overall, researchers estimated that about 4 percent of the children in the study would have an ADHD diagnosis by age 13.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how prenatal acetaminophen use might directly cause ADHD.    One limitation of the study is that long-term use of acetaminophen during pregnancy might indicate a more serious illness or injury, and researchers lacked data on the severity of conditions that led women to use the drug.    Another drawback is that researchers relied on survey data to identify when and how long in pregnancy women used acetaminophen as well as the reasons they took the drug. Many people in the study also didn’t report a reason for using acetaminophen.   It’s possible that the connections between acetaminophen and ADHD in the study were merely due to chance, said Dr. Antonio Saad, a researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston who wasn’t involved in the study.    “One also has to keep in mind that not using acetaminophen can have negative consequences,” Saad said by email. “Other pain and fever medications, such as ibuprofen, should not be used in pregnancy, which leaves narcotics as the only alternatives for pain and no alternatives for fever.”   Doctors generally advise pregnant women to take acetaminophen in the smallest dose possible for the shortest possible period of time when they have fevers.     “I don’t think that a very moderate dose of acetaminophen during only a few days would have any real effect on the developing brain,” Jordi Julvez, a researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    The increased risk of ADHD linked to longer use of acetaminophen might also be due to the severity of medical problems women had, not their use of the drug, said Dr. Chittaranjan Andrade of the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences in Bangalore, India.    A serious fever or infection, for example, might be the reason babies developed ADHD, not acetaminophen their mothers took, Andrade, who wasn’t involved in the study said by email.   “The results of this study do not adduce sufficiently strong data to discourage the use of (acetaminophen) if indicated during any trimester during pregnancy,” Andrade said.

2ygaEfY,2017-10-30,Aid groups struggle to improve dire conditions for Rohingya refugees," (Reuters Health) - More than a half-million Rohingya people have fled the latest wave of violence in Myanmar for refugee camps in Bangladesh, and most lack clean water, latrine facilities or even shelter from the elements, according to a Medicins Sans Frontiers physician based there.                    FILE PHOTO: Makeshift toilets to urinate are seen in an open space as there is no hygienic sanitation facilities available at Kutupalang Unregistered Refugee Camp, where Rohingya refugees stay, in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, February 9, 2017. REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain      “There are hardly any latrines so people have tried to rig up their own plastic sheeting around four bamboo poles, but there is nowhere for their waste to go except into the stream below. That is the same stream that, just 10 meters away, others are using to collect drinking water,” Dr. Kate White, the medical emergency manager in Kutupolong, the largest refugee settlement in Cox’s Bazar, wrote in an October 16 letter to the editor of The Lancet medical journal.     “Some people are using clothes that they have strung together to provide shelter from the elements,” she said. “But after two days of torrential rain and tropical thunderstorms, some communities’ shelter and their few belongings have completely washed away.”   “I can only imagine how incredibly terrible it must have been in their home village, if this is what they chose,” White added. “If this is the better option, the other must have been a living hell.”   The Cox’s Bazar area of Bangladesh was already crowded, White noted, since refugees from Myanmar have been arriving there for decades. Just 250,000 of the 1.2 million people living in the region are native Bangladeshis, with the rest being “forcibly displaced Myanmar nationals,” she adds.   The Rohingya, who are Muslim, have long been a persecuted minority in Myanmar, a Buddhist country. Myanmar has denied citizenship to the Rohingya since 1982. The country’s government and military have been accused of human rights abuses, including genocide. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled the country since the 1970s.   Since August 25, MSF has treated more than 30,000 people in Cox’s Bazar, “effectively five times the number of people who sought treatment at MSF facilities during the same period last year,” White told Reuters Health in an email. “The main theme among these patients is respiratory tract infections and diarrheal diseases, which are directly related to the poor hygiene conditions in the informal settlements.”   She added: “While we haven’t seen an outbreak of waterborne disease, the risk is huge. The longer we delay the building of latrines and increased efforts toward sanitation, the greater the risk.”   For “relatively decent sanitation” in the settlements, White wrote in the Lancet, it will be necessary to build 8,000 latrines and supply 2 million liters of water daily.   To date, she said in her email, “MSF has built 200 latrines, 25 boreholes and a gravity water supply system while trucking an average of 100 cubic meters (about 26,000 gallons) of water daily to the settlements from the MSF inpatient health facility borehole. Although we still have a long way to go, the work on the ground has been incredible.”   White said there are no signs that the flow of refugees will abate any time soon. “There’s been a steady stream of new arrivals. On 9 October alone, an estimated 11,000 new arrivals crossed into Bangladesh. And we’re seeing a steady flow of arrivals coming through every week via two entry points.”  "
2lmjFOC,2017-10-27,Baking soda plus water best for washing pesticides off apples," (Reuters Health) - Washing apples in water with a dash of baking soda is the most effective way to remove pesticide residue, new research shows.   The mix outperformed Clorox-spiked water for getting rid of the chemicals, and also worked better than plain water, Dr. Lili He of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst and her colleagues found. They reported their findings October 25 in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.   Pesticides are widely used in agriculture to kill bugs, fungi and other produce-plaguing pests. They can hurt humans, too, but most of us are exposed to amounts so tiny that they don’t pose a risk, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).    Many people try to limit their exposure to pesticides by washing produce, but whether or not this does anything to remove them has not been studied, Dr. He and her team note. They coated apples with thiabendazole, a fungicide, or phosmet, which is used to kill a variety of pests, and washed them with water or water mixed with bleach or baking soda. The researchers used Gala apples because they are widely consumed and also likely to contain a wide variety of pesticides.   Using super-sensitive, high-tech tests, the researchers checked on and within the apple for pesticides and measured pesticide concentration within plant tissue. Rinsing the fruit in the baking soda solution for 12 minutes was most effective for removing thiabendazole, they found, while a 15-minute baking soda rinse was most effective for getting rid of phosmet.   Some of the pesticide passed beyond the apple’s surface, with thiabendazole going four times deeper than phosmet. None of the washing methods could fully remove the residue.    After harvest, the EPA requires apple producers to soak the fruit for two minutes in bleach mixed with water. The quick dip is intended to remove bacteria and other organic matter, not to wash off pesticides, Dr. He noted in a telephone interview with Reuters Health, but it would be ideal to find a post-harvest treatment that would do both.   The baking soda solution is likely more effective because it can help break apart pesticide molecules, the researcher said, and can be used for washing other types of produce.  How well it works “depends on the structure of the fruits and vegetables, but it’s a general method,” she added.   Dr. He and her colleagues used a concentration of about one teaspoon of baking soda per two cups of water. But, she said, “You don’t need to be precise, just adding a little bit is better than not adding it.”    While deeper-penetrating pesticides could be removed by peeling an apple, the researcher said, this would mean missing out on the nutrient-rich skin. “It’s always been a two-sided story.”  "
2y7srpz,2017-10-26,Some GI disorders get disproportionate share of U.S. research funding," (Reuters Health) - Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as Crohn’s disease and Barrett’s esophagus get a bigger slice of U.S. public research funding than other GI conditions that affect many more Americans, researchers say.   Writing in the journal Gastroenterology, the study team questions how the National Institutes of Health makes spending decisions for GI research after finding no link between how many Americans are affected by a disease and the amount of money directed toward studying it.    Crohn’s disease, for example, has the second lowest prevalence of the conditions included in the analysis, afflicting about 0.25 percent of the American population, but it received the highest amount of funding, totaling $77.5 million over five years, researchers found. Celiac disease, which affects around 1 percent of Americans, received the lowest amount of research money, at around $15.4 million over the same period.    “NIH funding is restricted historically right now, and it’s now challenging for researchers to receive funding in almost any field,” senior study author Dr. Daniel Leffler of the North American Society for the Study of Celiac Disease said in a telephone interview.   “When there are restrictions on funding, decisions have to be made and projects have to be prioritized over others,” said Leffler, who also directs clinical research at the Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “In the end, it’s all taxpayer dollars, and we should have transparency about which areas are funded and why.”   Leffler and colleagues analyzed National Institutes of Health research grants for six GI disorders: celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Crohn’s disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, Barrett’s esophagus and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The database they used, known as Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools, was launched in late 2009 to create public accountability, the authors note.    Using other sources, they determined how many people in the U.S. are affected by each disease.   The team found that trends in funding remained stable during the five-year period, with Crohn’s disease consistently awarded the highest amount of money, at around $16 million per year, followed by Barrett’s esophagus at $13 million per year. NAFLD was awarded $7 million per year, followed by irritable bowel syndrome at $5 million per year and eosinophilic esophagitis at $4 million per year. Celiac disease consistently received the lowest amount at $3 million per year.   There was a similar pattern in the number of research grants awarded, with Crohn’s disease receiving the greatest number, at about 40 grants per year, and celiac disease with the fewest at eight grants per year.    Eosinophilic esophagitis had the lowest prevalence in the U.S. population, at about 0.04 percent, and received the second lowest amount of NIH funding over five years, at $18.9 million. Barrett’s esophagus, like celiac disease, affects about 1 percent of the population and received $64 million over the study period.   IBS, which affects 12.5 percent of Americans, got $24.6 million and NAFLD, the most common condition, afflicting 18 percent of Americans, received a total of $33 million.   Correlating research funding to prevalence of a disease could be misleading, said Dr. Gilaad Kaplan of the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the study.    A disorder like Crohn’s disease, for example, is predominantly diagnosed in young adults who experience debilitating symptoms. Since there is not a cure, these patients require lifelong medication to suppress their immune system and often undergo operations to remove parts of their bowels, Kaplan told Reuters Health. Other GI disorders may not carry the same burden or expense.   One limitation of the study, he added, is that there could be overlap among disorder names. Inflammatory bowel diseases, for example, often include Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis, and research on Crohn’s is relevant to ulcerative colitis, so prevalence numbers could be higher for that category.   “By no means should you take my comments as suggesting that celiac disease deserves less funding that Crohn’s disease,” Kaplan said by email. “But the decision of funding agencies like NIH should not be based on prevalence in isolation of other factors.”    As NIH funding remains restricted, researchers and GI advocacy groups should look at all possible sources of funding, including industry, foundations and other federal sources such as the Department of Defense, said Dr. Gregory Cooper of the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center in Ohio, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Funding for biomedical research is chronically lower than it ought to be,” he told Reuters Health by email. “Patient advocacy groups are important in lobbying for additional funding, and disease-specific foundations can help support research.”  "
2gVClQv,2017-10-25,First test of anti-epilepsy surgeries in children shows dramatic benefit," (Reuters Health) - Brain surgery for children whose epilepsy is resistant to drug therapy can produce a 10-fold increase in the odds of being seizure-free after one year and can do it without affecting IQ, according to a new Indian study of 116 patients in The New England Journal of Medicine.   Seventy-seven percent of the children were free of seizures at one year after the surgery, compared with seven percent in a control group of youngsters who received medical therapy alone while waiting for surgery. Behavior and quality of life also improved.   But surgery also produced serious adverse effects in one-third of the children, most frequently a weakness on one side of the body, known as hemiparesis. The researchers said that was to be expected and, without surgery, patients probably would have experienced similar problems as a result of their continuing seizures.   “What the study clearly shows is surgery for children produces seizure freedom compared to children not operated on for similar conditions,” senior author Dr. Manjari Tripathi, a professor of neurology and epilepsy at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.   Not only “does it reassure us that several surgical procedures are effective,” she said, it demonstrates that surgery “should be done as early as possible” once it becomes clear that a child is not responding to two anti-seizure medications.   About 50 million people worldwide suffer with epilepsy and drugs can’t control the seizures in approximately 30 percent of the cases.   “This is the first randomized study to look at surgical outcome in children,” said Dr. Donald Schomer, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Program at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was not involved in the research.    “The results are impressive,” he told Reuters Health by phone. Adults who undergo surgery often suffer from the collective effect of years of uncontrolled seizures. “The study in kids shows if you reduce the time from the onset of seizures from the 15 to 20 years you see in adults down to four to five years, the outcome is much better. It’s documentation that these techniques really work.”   Although 77 percent were judged by the Tripathi team to be seizure-free at the end of the study, some of those children actually had seizures immediately after surgery. Yet the cases were judged to be a success because the seizures decreased in frequency over time. Ultimately, 37 percent never had a seizure in the year after surgery.    When all seizures were taken into account, children who did not have surgery were four times more likely to have a seizure during that year than youngsters in the surgery group, the researchers calculated.   Success rates ranged from 87 percent to 100 percent depending on the type of surgery used to correct the child’s particular brain abnormality.   Surgery improved quality of life and social well-being, and it didn’t affect IQ, something that can decline with ongoing seizures. But Dr. Schomer said the children were only followed for one year, and “that may be too soon to see a noticeable change” in the intelligence quotient.   Post-surgery weakness was seen in 15 of the 19 patients who had a serious side effect following surgery.   The weakness “is significant,” Dr. Tripathi said. “The child may not be able to ambulate by his- or herself. But with physical therapy, all regain the lower and upper limb function within six months. The only thing that does not improve is the wrist and the fingers. They are left with this minor deficit. But even before surgery, some of them have this weakness.”   Other side effects depended on the area of the brain that was removed or disconnected from the rest of the brain.   In contrast, 16.5 percent of the children waiting for surgery had a serious injury as a result of their continuing seizures.   The surgery “had a transforming effect on how they get along in life,” Dr. Tripathi said. “Many could go back school earlier or go back to being tutored, and get on with their life.”   But a major problem facing these children is getting insurance companies to pay for such surgeries, said Dr. Schomer of Beth Israel.   Rather than pay $35,000 to $50,000 on surgery that might cure the problem and prevent further damage to the child, insurance companies prefer to demand that more drugs be tried, even if the odds of them working in drug-resistant cases is small, he said.   “Studies like this lend credence to the idea that the earlier you do it, the better the outcome,” he said. “I hope insurance companies will look at this and realize that early detection and surgery, if appropriate, will ultimately save them money in the long term.”   "
2yGAXKZ,2017-10-25,"Best pro baseball players throw right, hit left"," (Reuters Health) - For baseball players, throwing right-handed and batting left-handed may be the best combination for success in the major leagues, according a new analysis of player data from 1871 through 2016.   The findings, published in a letter to The New England Journal of Medicine, show that such players - among them, Boston Red Sox legend Ted Williams - were far more likely to be .300 hitters and were also more likely to end up in baseball’s Hall of Fame.   That challenges the call of a 1982 study, which claimed that southpaws who bat left handed were the better batters, perhaps because the brains of left-handers are less likely to compartmentalize various functions.   The new data suggest that learned behavior, not the brain structure of southpaws, is the key to success, coauthor David Mann of the Department of Human Movement Sciences at Vrije University in Amsterdam told Reuters Health by phone.   “We may be teaching people to bat the wrong way,” he said. “When children are younger, we should teach them to bat both ways,” and several factors may influence why left handed batters tend to be more successful at the game.   Mann said he had previously found a similar trend among cricket players, and the same factors may play a role among professional golfers.   So he and his colleagues turned to baseball to see if the effect could be seen there, too.   They confirmed that players who threw left and batted left were more likely to be successful hitters than those who batted right and threw right.   But right handers batting left turned out to be even more successful.   Those players were 5.33 times more common in the major leagues than on high-school and grammar-school teams, which turned out to be best odds of getting onto a professional team in the first place. In fact, young players who throw right and bat right had the poorest odds of getting into the majors.   Furthermore, the odds of getting into the major leagues and being in the Hall of Fame were 9.92 times higher, and the odds of having a batting average of .299 or greater was 18.43 times higher, for young right handers who batted left.   Additionally, although right handers who bat left represented only 11.8 percent of all major league players, they made up 19.9 percent of all Hall of Fame members and 31.6 percent of the top hitters, further evidence of the trend.   “When you allow for the smaller number of those players, there seems to be a much bigger advantage for right handers,” said Mann.   In contrast, left handers who bat left made up 15.9 percent of players, 13.1 percent of Hall of Famers, and 21.0 percent of top hitters. Players who bat right and threw right made up 62.6 percent of major leaguers, 55.7 percent of Hall of Fame inductees and 44.3 percent of those with a career batting average at or above .299.   The Mann team said several factors may be a work.   The biggest may be that “players who throw right-handed and bat left-handed enjoy an additional biomechanical advantage, with the dominant (throwing) hand being placed further from the hitting end of the bat, providing a longer lever with which to hit the ball,” they said.   Other potential explanations for the trend: The swing of a left-handed hitter automatically twists the batter in the direction of first base (making it easier to take off for the bag after contact), left-handed batters start off closer to first base, pitchers may have less experience throwing to lefties because they are less common, and right fielders may be slightly less skilled than other players.   “This isn’t saying that professional players should change now,” said Mann. “It’s asking, ‘What’s the best way to teach players at the start?’ “   Alan Nathan, professor emeritus of physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the man behind the Physics of Baseball website, told Reuters Health he would be more comfortable with the conclusion if the authors had come up with some hard evidence to explain it.   “Had they chosen a different metric such as home runs, they might have found something different,” he said. “From a purely baseball point of view, I’m very skeptical of conclusions based on complicated statistical analysis.”  "
2zEU3i6,2017-10-25,"Depression, fatigue tied to more hospital stays for terminal cancer"," (Reuters Health) - Patients with advanced cancer may spend more time in the hospital when they have untreated symptoms like fatigue and depression, a recent study suggests.    The study focused on 1,036 advanced cancer patients who had unplanned hospital stays. More than half of them had moderate or severe fatigue, poor wellbeing, drowsiness, pain and lack of appetite, and more than one in four had depression or anxiety.   Overall, these unplanned hospitalizations lasted an average of 6.3 days, but stays were longer when patients were depressed. Within 90 days of being sent home, 43 percent of the patients were hospitalized again; repeat hospitalizations were more common among people with anxiety.    Efforts to alleviate patients’ symptom burden “hold great promise for improving patients’ experience with their illness, enhancing their quality of life, and reducing their health care utilization,” said lead study author Dr. Ryan Nipp, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.   The findings can help clinicians and policymakers assess the extent to which uncontrolled symptoms contribute to excessive and costly cancer care, Nipp said by email.    Although many terminal cancer patients would prefer to remain at home, more than half of them are admitted to the hospital at least once during their last month of life, and 10 percent are hospitalized at least twice during this time, researchers note in the journal Cancer.    None of the patients in the current study were receiving treatment designed to cure their tumors.    Within 90 days of being admitted to the hospital, 42 percent of the patients died. The odds of death were higher for patients who reported being depressed or suffering physical and psychological problems.    The study was done at a single medical center, and most of the patients were white, married and educated beyond high school. The results might be different for a more diverse group of patients, the authors note.    And while the research showed a link between uncontrolled physical and mental health problems and more hospital time, the study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how these untreated issues might increase use of health services, the researchers also point out.    Even so, the study adds to evidence that these untreated symptoms may lead to avoidable treatments that may drive up health care costs, said Dr. Preeti Malani, a researcher at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study.    “From an overall perspective, every day that an individual with advanced cancer is in the hospital, that’s a day he or she isn’t home, so this is also an important quality of life issue,” Malani said by email.    Part of the problem may be that patients don’t know about their options for palliative care that focuses on comfort rather than a cure, or they lack access to these services, Malani added.    “Improved access to palliative care would be helpful for symptom management as well as avoiding hospitalizations and aggressive treatment that doesn’t provide benefits,” Malani noted. Care teams need to make palliative care part of routine care, she said.   Part of the problem may be helping patients transition from aggressive treatment to comfort care, said Dio Kavalieratos, a researcher at the Palliative and Supportive Institute at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It intuitively makes sense that if a patient’s symptoms are under control, that is one (more) reason that they would be able to stay comfortably at home instead of in the hospital,” Kavalieratos said by email. “Unfortunately, most cancer therapy is so focused on treating the cancer itself, that concerns like symptoms, emotional well being, and quality of life sometimes aren’t the top priority.”  "
2zDrd1R,2017-10-25,Depression tied to shorter lifespan," (Reuters Health) - People who suffer from depression may not live as long as individuals who don’t experience this mental health disorder, a Canadian study suggests.   Researchers examined six decades of mental health and mortality data on 3,410 adults during three time periods: 1952 to 1967, 1968 to 1990 and 1991 to 2011. Depression was associated with an increased risk of premature death in every decade of the study for men, and starting in the 1990s for women.   The connection between depression and a shorter lifespan appeared strongest in the years following a depressive episode, leading the researchers to conclude that at least part of the risk might be reversed by effectively treating the mental illness.   “For some individuals depression can be very serious condition,” said lead study author Stephen Gilman of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.   “Given our finding that individuals whose depression was present at multiple time points in our study were at highest risk, it is very important to seek treatment for depression and to be vigilant about recurrences,” Gilman said by email.    Depression has long been linked to a variety of health problems, in part because it may lead to physiological changes in the body and also because it can contribute to unhealthy habits like a poor diet, inactivity, smoking and excessive drinking.    In the current study, however, researchers found a link between depression and premature death even after accounting for things like obesity, smoking and drinking habits.     “It is known that depression is associated with an increased risk of death from heart disease,” said Dr. Ralph Stewart, a researcher at the University of Auckland in New Zealand who wasn’t involved in the study.”   “This study suggests that this increased risk of death extends to other causes of premature death and persists over decades,” Stewart said by email.    The researchers examined data from the Stirling County Study, which began in 1952 in Canada and is one of the first community-based studies on mental illness.    People were about 50 years old on average when they joined the study. Across the three time periods examined, researchers followed half of the participants for at least 19 years.    Researchers calculated life expectancies at age 25 for men and women with and without depression in each wave of the study.    In the first wave, life expectancy with depression was 10 and 12 years shorter for women and men, respectively, researchers report in CMAJ. It was 7 years shorter for men with depression in the second wave, and 7 and 18 years shorter for women and men with depression, respectively, in the last group.    Men with depression were almost three times as likely to die early at the beginning of the study, but the increased risk declined to 52 percent by the end.    Women’s risk of a premature death increased, however. At the start of the study, women with depression were 8 percent more likely to die prematurely, and by the end their increased risk was similar to men’s odds at 51 percent.   Limitations include a long interval between participant interviews, which prevented the research team from determining the exact timing of depression and recurrences, the authors note.   Even so, the findings underscore the importance of diagnosing and treating depression, said Dr. Gjin Ndrepepa, a researcher at the German Heart Center and Technical University in Munich, Germany, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Since the risk related to depression decays over time, great efforts should be made to improve treatment and prevent recurrences of depressive episodes,” Ndrepepa said by email.   Treating depression, Ndrepepa added, “can reduce depressive symptoms, improve quality of life and potentially prolong life.”  "
2zD0e6o,2017-10-25,Americans don’t believe owning a firearm boosts suicide risk," (Reuters Health) - Most Americans don’t believe having a gun at home increases the risk of suicide, whether they are gun owners or not, according to a new study.   Research has shown that having access to a gun increases the likelihood that a person who attempts suicide will succeed. Still, among 4,000 people surveyed recently, nearly 85 percent disagreed that the presence of a firearm in a home increased the risk of suicide.   Andrew Conner of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston and colleagues looked at data from a 2015 survey about firearm ownership, in which people were asked if they agreed or disagreed with the statement, “Having a gun in the home increases the risk of suicide.”   “What surprised us was just how few people understood that suicide risk increased because of ready access to firearms,” Conner told Reuters Health by email.    Of the 4,000 people who responded, 15 percent agreed that the presence of a firearm increases the risk for suicide. That included 6 percent of gun owners, 9 percent of those who live with someone who has a gun and 20 percent of those who live in a home without firearms.    One in three survey takers who were health care professionals agreed that having a household firearm increases suicide risk, including 12 percent who owned guns.    Overall, fewer than 10 percent of gun owners with children and gun owners who had received firearm training agreed that household firearms increase suicide risk.   In 2015, more than 44,000 people in the U.S. died by suicide, and half used firearms, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of these came from the person’s home.   “Medical societies recognize that removing guns from a suicidal person’s home can do more to immediately reduce the risk of death than any other known treatment, (but) most physicians do not counsel their patients to remove or even store guns in ways that make them inaccessible to at-risk people,” Conner said.   Health care professionals must learn to communicate the risk and talk about it with their patients, the study authors wrote in the Annals of Internal Medicine.   “The firearms discussion is often around mass shootings and homicide, but the truth of the matter is that suicides make up the large majority of all firearm deaths in the U.S.,” said Dr. Andrew Anglemyer of the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. Anglemyer, who wasn’t involved with this study, has researched suicide and firearms access.   In 2011, Florida passed a law forbidding doctors to ask their patients about guns in the home, but portions of the law were struck down by a federal appeals court earlier this year.   “Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the U.S. and the second leading cause of death among children and young adults,” Conner noted in his email.    In some states, family members can ask courts to temporarily remove firearms from homes of those who pose a risk to themselves.  Law enforcement agencies and gun retailers may also be willing to temporarily store firearms to help prevent suicide, a recent study suggested.   A limitation of the current study is that it relies on one question in the survey, which may have been misinterpreted to mean suicidal ideation rather than death by suicide, the study authors wrote.   “We’re missing the boat here on reaching the vast majority of Americans with an important message,” said Dr. J. John Mann of Columbia University in New York. Mann, who wasn’t involved with this study, researches firearm availability and suicide rates.    “We need to do the same public campaign we did for smoking and tell people through TV, advertisements and email about this,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “Doctors should talk to their patients during annual exams and discuss gun safety if they have them in the home.”   Health professionals should move the conversation beyond only “at-risk” patients, said Dr. Augustine Kposowa of the University of California, Riverside, who researches the links between firearms, suicide and unemployment.    “In this country, people’s identities have become mixed up with their jobs, and in desperate moments of joblessness, it’s easier to pick up that gun,” Kposowa, who wasn’t involved with this study, told Reuters Health by phone. “Guns are detrimental. Guns carry a sense of fatality and finality.”  "
2y1pSp7,2017-10-25,Childcare staff behavior may encourage kids to sample healthier food," (Reuters Health) - Meal-time behaviors by childcare providers may encourage children to sample more nutritious foods, a recent study from Oklahoma suggests.   Specifically, children in daycare were more willing to taste greater numbers of nutritious foods when staff members sat with them and ate the same food, when the staff determined whether children were full before removing the plate, and when they talked about healthy food.    In contrast, merely sitting with children at meal times, or encouraging picky eaters to try a food, “were not associated with desirable outcomes, such as children tasting nutrient-dense foods more frequently and unhealthy foods less frequently,” the researchers reported in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.   The study emphasizes the importance of slowing down, taking a few moments - lunch doesn’t really last that long - to role model, talk about healthy choices, and enjoy the meal with children, said study co-author Susan Sisson of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City.   Over 60 percent of American children aged three to five attend early care and education centers, study researchers noted.   The community-based study involved 201 three- to five-year-olds at 25 early care and education centers, including eleven tribally affiliated centers, across rural and urban settings in Oklahoma.    Trained observers recorded classroom behaviors and the children’s receptiveness to tasting healthy foods, such as fruit, vegetables, and low-fat dairy items, as well as less healthy fried vegetables, fried meat, high-fat meat, and high-fat/high-sugar food items.   As quantities for serving sizes can vary dramatically, “each food item was counted as long as the child tasted the food item at the lunch meal, rather than using actual serving sizes,” the authors explained in their report.    “Young children may not consume full servings of foods due to their bodies’ needs,” they added. “By counting each type of vegetable served rather than the volume of servings, centers that serve mixed vegetables are favored because they are exposing children to multiple vegetables in one meal that collectively add up to the volume of one serving.”   Bethany Yon, spokesperson for the American Society for Nutrition who was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health that the study’s emphasis on how willing the children were to taste different foods, rather than how much they ate, is “certainly a relevant approach when observing the toddler and preschool population where feeding goals are often around acceptance of new foods, and young children frequently enter a phase of food neophobia.”    Charlotte Stirling-Reed, a registered nutritionist and spokesperson for UK-based Nutrition Society, who also was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health, “I regularly deal with little fussy eaters and believe that childcare settings can play a huge role in getting children to eat well from a young age.”    “The idea that they have used ‘tastes’ as opposed to amount eaten is still quite useful as tastes often increase acceptance over time. Getting young children to have small tastes of food can be really important for improving familiarity with different foods,” Stirling-Reed said.   "
2y1JTMl,2017-10-24,Individualized diets may help ease irritable bowel syndrome," (Reuters Health) - People struggling with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) might do better on an individualized diet, a recent study suggests.   People with IBS who went on customized diets that avoided foods with the potential to trigger symptoms felt better than patients whose diets included foods that were problematic for them, researchers found.    As many as one in five adults may have IBS, a disorder that can cause chronic abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, and constipation, researchers note in BMJ Open Gastroenterology.    Intolerance to certain foods can trigger these symptoms, and patients may seek relief by using blood tests to pinpoint which foods they need to avoid.    For the current study, researchers did blood tests to identify problematic foods for 58 patients with IBS. Then, the researchers randomly assigned patients to follow diets that purposely avoided or included these problem foods for four weeks.    Participants did not know whether they had been put on diets designed to include or exclude problem foods.    While all of the participants reported improvement at the end of the experiment, people on individualized diets that excluded problem foods felt significantly better overall and in terms of symptom severity, the study found.    The blood test “may identify the few foods that are worsening symptoms, resulting in a more manageable dietary plan, and do so in a shorter time than by a trial-and-error approach,” said lead study author Dr. Ather Ali of Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.    The blood test used in the experiment, called a leukocyte activation test, has not been rigorously tested, however, and the study was small. Ali noted in an email that more research is needed to confirm the findings.    The two groups of participants didn’t report meaningful differences in quality of life, but people on individualized diets excluding problem foods experienced improvements in symptoms like abdominal pain and swelling.    Beyond its small size and the newness of the blood test approach, another limitation of the study is that researchers relied on participants to accurately recall their symptoms, the authors note.    Because the study was brief, people did a good job of following their assigned diet. It’s possible patients wouldn’t stick to the diet as well over a longer period of time, the researchers also point out.    Even so, using blood tests to identify only a few problem foods might offer patients a less restrictive diet than an approach often used for IBS that requires people to avoid a wide variety of foods, Ali said.    Often, patients are put on what’s known as a `low FODMAP’ diet that restricts foods high in fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs), carbohydrates that are quickly fermented by intestinal bacteria. Fermentation can produce gas and bloating that may contribute to IBS symptoms.    “Patients demand advice on restriction diets as many experience onset or worsening of their symptoms in relation to intake of certain foods,” said Dr. Laura Rindom Krogsgaard, a researcher at Zealand University Hospital in Koege, Denmark, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “In recent years, focus has been on the low FODMAP diet, but we still lack evidence for the effect of the diet followed by patients in the long term and a clarity of the possible side effects,” Krogsgaard said by email.    Part of the problem is that patients with IBS often report symptom improvement in diet studies even when they’re placed on a sham eating plan that wasn’t designed to ease symptoms, Krogsgaard said.    Cell Science Systems of Deerfield Beach, Florida, did the blood tests and funded the study.    It took years of research to convince doctors to propose a low FODMAP diet to patients, and it will also take more time and research to see if it makes sense to consider food intolerance blood tests as a reasonable way to craft individualized diets, said Dr. Peter Gibson, a researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “The results of this study should not change practice,” Gibson said by email. “I would want to see more studies, over a longer period, show gratifyingly good effects (the effects were not great – quality of life did not change at all) before recommending such an approach.”  "
2l8roQ4,2017-10-23,Hot tub birth tied to life-threatening infection for baby," (Reuters Health) - A newborn girl in Canada developed a life-threatening infection after being delivered in a hot tub, according to a case report that some doctors say offers fresh evidence that women should not deliver babies in water.    The baby girl was delivered full-term and was healthy at birth. But she was hospitalized at eight days old with high fever, poor feeding and fussiness, and then was moved to the intensive care unit (ICU) because her organs were failing, researchers report in the medical journal CMAJ.    She was diagnosed with sepsis, a life-threatening immune response to an infection with Legionella bacterium that entered her bloodstream. This bacterium thrives in warm water, and the hot tub, which was filled days before her birth, may have created an ideal environment for an infection.    This baby’s experience “serves to highlight a severe and potentially fatal adverse neonatal outcome of underwater birth, especially when prefilled heated pools are used,” said lead author Dr. Michelle Barton of Western University in London, Ontario.   “Although freshly filling a hot tub may reduce the risk, serious infections can still potentially occur in newborns whose immune systems are quite weak,” Barton said by email.    The baby had been born underwater in a hot tub at home, supervised by a midwife. The hot tub had been filled three days before birth, a practice that can lead to increased concentrations of bacteria such as Legionella in the water as it thrives in temperatures from 20 to 42 degrees Celsius (68 to 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit).   After multiple tests, she was started on antibiotics to treat infection and began to improve. She spent five weeks on a ventilator in the ICU before she left the hospital.    The baby might have died, however, if she hadn’t been tested for Legionella and given an antibiotic regimen tailored to this diagnosis, Barton said.    Doctors in the U.S. and the UK advise against water birth in hot tubs or pools with jets because of an increased risk of contamination, and they also caution against filling the tubs in advance, researchers note.    For mothers, laboring in water may help ease pain, lower the need for anesthesia and potentially speed up the early, or first, stage of labor before the cervix is fully dilated and the baby is ready to emerge, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).   Because rare but serious complications have been documented with water births, and because evidence of benefits that might outweigh these risks is lacking, women should avoid delivering babies in water, said Dr. Joseph Wax, chairman of ACOG’s committee on obstetrics practice and an author of the guidelines.   “It is recommended that delivery occur on land and not in water,” Wax, a researcher at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, said by email.    Heated tubs are especially dangerous, noted Dr. Alastair Sutcliffe, a researcher at the Institute of Child Health at University College London who wasn’t involved in the case report.    “Warm water is an ideal environment for some bugs to grow,” Sutcliffe said by email. “Babies are not dolphins – those are born underwater – humans are land mammals.”   Laboring in water prior to delivery hasn’t been found to be harmful, said Dr. Amos Grunebaum, a researcher at New York Weill Cornell Medicine who wasn’t involved in the case report.    “The actual amount of newborn complications after underwater births are unknown because there are no population studies on this,” Grunebaum said by email. “But complications can be serious enough to recommend against an underwater birth.”  "
2h0W69y,2017-10-23,Heart health disparities take toll on African-Americans," (Reuters Health) - African-Americans have worse cardiovascular health and more deaths from heart disease than other groups, at least partly from less effective disease prevention and management efforts, according to a scientific statement from the American Heart Association (AHA).   “While African Americans are more likely to experience many cardiovascular diseases, in particular strokes and heart failure, they are also more likely to die from cardiovascular diseases,” Dr. Mercedes R. Carnethon from Northwestern University Preventive Medicine in Chicago told Reuters Health by email.    Because African Americans develop nearly all cardiovascular diseases - heart attack, stroke, and heart failure - at a relatively young age, she continued, “higher rates of death may arise from the length of time that African Americans live with these conditions.”    “Interrupting this process by preventing the early onset of cardiovascular diseases is one strategy to reduce disparities in cardiovascular disease mortality,” she said.    Traditional cardiovascular risk factors - high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis - are more common and start at earlier ages among African Americans, Carnethon and colleagues report in the journal Circulation.   Unfortunately, not much has changed since 2005 when a special issue of Circulation pointed out disparities in the rates of cardiovascular disease, disease management, and outcomes for African-Americans.   Many of the differences arise from unhealthy behaviors, lower implementation of guidelines shown to improve cardiovascular health, ingrained cultural preferences and attitudes, and lack of persistence in following lifestyle changes that need to be lifelong, the research team writes.   African Americans also have higher rates of certain health conditions that predispose to cardiovascular disease - such as chronic kidney disease, sickle cell disease/sickle cell trait, and HIV, for example.   Genetic differences between African-Americans and other ethnic groups appear to explain only a small part of the disparity in cardiovascular disease rates and outcomes.    Finding strategies that reach younger African-Americans and men with disease prevention messages remains a significant challenge, Carnethon’s team notes.    “Cardiovascular diseases are preventable with healthy lifestyles,” she said. “Unfortunately, many African-Americans do not have equal access to the resources needed to lead healthy lifestyles, specifically access to healthy foods, safe spaces for physical activity, and peaceful homes and communities that promote restorative sleep.”    “Despite the strides our country has made in broadening access to healthcare, many African-Americans, particularly those in lower income groups, are still unable to afford and prioritize preventive care visits,” she said.    Dr. LaPrincess Brewer from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who has worked to promote cardiovascular health in African-American communities, told Reuters Health by email there’s a need for “culturally relevant, community-based cardiovascular health interventions that focus more on positive motivation towards promoting cardiovascular health rather than the negative impact of cardiovascular disease.”   “By increasing awareness of this enduring and colossal issue, we can then in turn empower African-Americans to play a role in improving their own cardiovascular health in tandem with their healthcare providers and social support networks,” she said.   “The AHA Life’s Simple 7 provides an evidence-based, advantageous framework to increase population-wide awareness among African-Americans,” she said. ( bit.ly/2h1N38d )   Clinicians, researchers, public health practitioners, social services, and community stakeholders must work together “to develop an effective approach to improve cardiovascular health among all Americans,” Brewer said. “However, it will take a concerted effort to address not only the high burden of traditional risk factors among African-Americans, but also the plethora of social and environmental contextual barriers faced by this population.”  "
2yEDdTr,2017-10-20,Does diabetes make a heart attack feel different?," (Reuters Health) - People with diabetes may not always feel classic symptoms like acute chest pain when they have a heart attack, according to a small study that offers a potential explanation for why these episodes are more deadly for diabetics.    Researchers examined data from detailed interviews with 39 adults in the UK who had been diagnosed with diabetes and had also experienced a heart attack. Most of the participants reported feeling some chest pain, but they often said it didn’t feel like they expected or that they didn’t think it was really a heart attack.    “Long term diabetes damages your heart in many ways (increased blocking of the heart’s blood vessels), but it also damages your nerves,” said study co-author Dr. Melvyn Jones of University College London.    “So a bit like a diabetic might not feel the stubbing of their toe, they also feel less pain from damaged heart muscle when the blood supply gets cut off, so they don’t get the classical crushing chest pain of a heart attack,” Jones said by email.    People with diabetes are three times more likely to die from heart disease than the general population and possibly six times more likely to have a heart attack, Jones added.    All patients in the study received care at one of three hospitals in London, and they ranged in age from 40 to 90. Most were male, and roughly half were white.    The majority had what’s known as type 2 diabetes, which is tied to aging and obesity and happens when the body can’t properly use insulin to convert blood sugar into energy. Four of them had type 1 diabetes, a lifelong condition that develops when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone needed to allow blood sugar to enter cells.   Many of the participants described heart attack symptoms such as chest pain and discomfort.    However, many felt like their pain wasn’t severe enough to be a heart attack or didn’t consider the discomfort they felt in their chest as similar to what they would expect with a heart attack.    This may have contributed to delays in seeking care, which are in turn associated with lower survival odds and a higher risk of complications and disability for people who do live through the event, researchers note in the journal BMJ Open.    The study was small, and it wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how diabetes might lead people to experience different heart attack symptoms.    Still, it confirms a longstanding belief that people with diabetes may be prone to atypical heart attack symptoms, said Dr. Deepak Bhatt, executive director of Interventional Cardiovascular Programs at Brigham and Women’s Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and a researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston.    “Atypical means instead of the more classic chest pain or chest pressure, patients experience symptoms such as extreme fatigue or breathlessness, for example,” Bhatt, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   “The biology of the heart attack is the same,” Bhatt added. “But the thought is that patients with advanced diabetes may have a degree of nerve damage (neuropathy) and therefore may be less likely to experience the more common chest pain or chest pressure from a heart attack.”   Patients with diabetes should understand that they’re more likely to have a heart attack than other people, said Dr. John Wilkins, a researcher at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study.   “They should have regular follow-up with their physicians, keep their blood sugars well controlled, lead a heart-healthy lifestyle, avoid the development of cardiovascular risk factors like high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and if they have risk factors they should make sure they are appropriately managed,” Wilkins said by email.    “They should also be familiar with the symptoms that suggest that they might be having a heart attack or an impending heart attack and know how to respond if those symptoms develop,” Wilkins advised.   "
2yrwiNC,2017-10-20,Follow-up care for acute kidney injury may be lacking," (Reuters Health) - Kidney specialists recommend follow-up care for most patients who have experienced acute kidney injury, but only a minority of patients have been getting that care, according to a Canadian study.   “Acute kidney injury refers to a sudden loss of kidney function that usually develops over the course of days in patients who are hospitalized for a wide variety of conditions,” senior author Dr. Matthew James told Reuters Health by email.   “Kidney problems can resolve after an acute kidney injury; however, some - but not all - patients can develop long-term complications, which include high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular events,” said James, a researcher at the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary.   It’s estimated that 500 of every 100,000 adults in North America, or around 1.4 million people, are hospitalized with acute kidney disease each year, James and his colleagues write in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.   There are many possible causes of kidney injury, including low blood pressure, heart failure or failure of other organs, overuse of NSAID painkillers, burns, major surgery and severe allergic reactions, according to the U.S. National Kidney Foundation.   James and colleagues surveyed 145 Canadian kidney specialists, or nephrologists, presenting them with a variety of acute kidney injury scenarios and asking whether the expert would recommend follow-up care for each patient and what factors would influence that decision.    The researchers then looked at how many patients hospitalized with acute kidney injury in the province of Alberta between 2005 and 2014 actually did have follow-up care from a nephrologist.   The study team found that nephrologists indicated they would definitely or probably re-evaluate patients in 87 percent of the scenarios provided by the researchers.   The doctors were more likely to recommend follow-up for patients with a history of pre-existing chronic kidney disease, heart failure, a need for acute dialysis or a less complete recovery of kidney function.    But, the researchers discovered, only 24 percent of actual patients were seen by a nephrologist in Alberta within one year of being hospitalized with acute kidney injury.    About 20 percent of patients over age 80 and about 43 percent of patients with chronic kidney disease received follow-up care. Almost 80 percent of patients who had consulted with a nephrologist before their hospital stay and about 41 percent who saw nephrologists while in the hospital had follow-ups during the first year, the researchers found.    There is a substantial disparity between the opinions of nephrologists and actual processes of care for nephrology evaluation of patients after hospitalization with acute kidney, James said.   “However, nearly all patients who did not receive nephrology follow-up were seen by at least one other physician within a year of discharge, suggesting there are other opportunities for physicians to follow-up and improve care for patients that have had acute kidney injury,” he told Reuters Health.   Medicare data show similarly low rates of nephrology referral after hospitalization for dialysis-requiring acute kidney disease in the U.S., noted Dr. Joseph A. Vassalotti, chief medical officer of the National Kidney Foundation, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “If you compare what I could call a ‘kidney attack’ or (Acute Kidney Injury) requiring dialysis to a heart attack or a myocardial infarction the care is very different,” Vassalotti said.   Most heart attack patients receive care in Coronary Care Units, or specialized ICUs or other coronary units devoted to the care of patients with heart disease. Cardiologists are nearly always involved and patients are highly likely to see a cardiologist after discharge, Vassalotti said.    “In contrast, what I am calling a kidney attack has a variety of causes and may be cared for anywhere in the hospital (ICU, medical floor, surgical floor, obstetrics, etc),” he said in an email.   In-hospital acute kidney injury is a condition in which checklists or other forms of protocols can improve the consistency and quality of care, Vassalotti added.   It’s important for people with chronic kidney disease to know that it’s the most important risk for acute kidney injury and people with the condition should work with their primary doctor or nephrologist on how to prevent acute kidney injury, he said.

2zpoLM4,2017-10-20,"With time, shoe inserts may help ease plantar heel pain"," (Reuters Health) - It could take a little time for orthotic shoe inserts to help relieve plantar heel pain, but the prefabricated versions sold in drugstores may work just as well as more expensive custom alternatives, a recent study suggests.    Plantar heel pain is one of the most common foot ailments, affecting about 4 percent of the population and an even higher proportion of elderly people and athletes, researchers note in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Many doctors recommend shoe inserts to ease this pain by supporting the arches and taking pressure off the heel, but research to date has been inconclusive about the effectiveness of this approach.    For the current study, researchers analyzed data from 19 previously published studies with a total of 1,660 participants. They found moderate-quality evidence that orthotic shoe inserts worked better than sham inserts at reducing pain after people had worn them for a bit - from about 7 to 12 weeks of use.    For this same time frame, customized orthotics appeared a bit better at easing pain than prefabricated versions, but the difference was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance, the study also found.    “Our finding that foot orthoses can effectively reduce pain suggests that they are a valid treatment option for plantar heel pain,” said lead study author Glen Whittaker, a podiatry researcher at La Trobe University in Victoria, Australia.    “Furthermore, because we found that contoured prefabricated foot orthoses are as effective for plantar heel pain as customized foot orthoses, prefabricated foot orthoses should be used initially rather than customized foot orthoses because they cost less and are immediately available,” Whittaker said by email.    The most common cause of heel pain is what’s known as plantar fasciitis, which occurs when the ligament connecting the heel bone to the toes gets strained, weakened, swollen and irritated or inflamed.    Shoe inserts may reduce plantar heel pain by redistributing pressure away from the bottom of the heel to the arch, and may also prevent the arch from dropping, which could reduce tension in the plantar fascia, Whittaker said.    Foot orthotics didn’t appear to help ease pain or improve function after up to 6 weeks of use, or beyond 12 weeks of use, the study also found.    This suggests that patients who want to try orthotics might want to initially use them in conjunction with medication to ease pain and inflammation, Whittaker said. Other treatment options include getting corticosteroid injections or using tape or a brace on the foot to relieve pressure on the heel.    One limitation of the study is that it didn’t include data focused specifically on sports-related pain, so it’s unclear if the results would apply to athletes, the authors note.    It’s also possible that some people could get little or no benefit from using the shoe inserts, the authors also conclude.    “The main take-home message for patients is that the evidence for relief of plantar heel pain by orthotic treatment is weak,” said Peter Cavanagh, a researcher in orthopedics and sports medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Thus, their level of expectation for a cure of plantar heel pain by using orthotics should be moderate,” Cavanagh said by email.    While it may make sense for patients to try over-the-counter prefabricated shoe inserts before spending more on custom versions, it’s also possible that seeing a health care provider first might help people get a device that’s better suited to the shape of their foot, Cavanagh added.    “Patients often try many different therapies sequentially or simultaneously,” Cavanagh said. “Orthotics can reasonably be considered to be one of them.”  "
2xOFbfX,2017-10-19,Insurance a major factor in blacks’ higher breast cancer mortality," (Reuters Health) - African-American women have worse breast cancer survival than white women in the U.S., and a new study suggests that is largely because black women are less likely to have health insurance.   About 23 percent of black women diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004-2013 had either no health insurance or had Medicaid coverage, versus 8 percent of white breast cancer patients, Dr. Ahmedin Jemal of the American Cancer Society in Atlanta and colleagues report in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.    That insurance difference explained about 37 percent of the excess mortality among black women, the researchers calculated. The next most important factor was actual differences in the tumors, which accounted for 23 percent of the mortality disparity.   Black women’s breast cancer mortality is now 40 percent higher than white women’s, but up until the early 1980s, white women were actually more likely to die after a breast cancer diagnosis, Jemal noted in a telephone interview. That’s because screening for and treatment of breast cancer has been getting better, he explained, but white women have benefited more than black women from these advances.   “What has changed is we have these scientific advances in early detection and treatment, we have mammography, we have adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, we have hormone therapy, we have now even targeted therapy,” Jemal said. “We know that black women are less likely to receive high-quality mammograms, less likely to receive a follow-up after an abnormal mammogram, and are less likely to receive targeted therapy.”   In the new study, Jemal and his team looked at records for 563,497 women ages 18 to 64 who had been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, meaning the disease had not spread beyond the breast. Among the more than three-quarters who had hormone-sensitive disease, the risk of dying during follow-up was twice as high for black women as for white women.   Insurance accounted for the largest portion of black women’s increased risk, followed by tumor characteristics, co-existing illnesses (11 percent) and treatment differences (5 percent).   The study looked at younger women because women over 65 are more likely to have similar health coverage under the Medicare program for seniors, the authors note. Indeed, previous research has found smaller disparities in survival among older black and white women and a much larger role for tumor biology in that disparity, they write.   “In this country if you don’t have health insurance you are out of luck,” Jemal said. “It’s a barrier to prevention, early detection and receipt of standard-of-care treatment.”   Many of the women on Medicaid in the current study had been signed up after being diagnosed with cancer, Jamal noted.   “Survival disparities between black and white breast cancer patients are largely driven by differences in insurance,” he said. “Policy makers should make sure that all the scientific advances we have had over the years are accessible to all patients regardless of their socioeconomic status or race or ethnicity.”   “This puts it in black and white, literally, and shows you that there are survival differences that are based on insurance and there are racial differences based on insurance, so if you give people insurance and get them the care that’s needed, you can have an impact and reduce this excess risk,” said Dr. Nina Bickell of The Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “The wonder of the Affordable Care Act is it really tried to take a more universal approach to enabling access,” Bickell added, noting that studies are already showing improved health outcomes in states that have opted for Medicare expansion.   “What’s so important about this study is that it’s showing that when you gain access via coverage, via insurance, you can improve survival,” she said in a telephone interview. “One can only hope,” she added, that the new findings will help build public support for continuing the Affordable Care Act, rather than dismantling it.

2yCMQBV,2017-10-19,Do fewer patients die with female surgeons?," (Reuters Health) - Patients may have better survival odds with female surgeons than with male surgeons, a recent Canadian study suggests.     Researchers examined data on 104,630 patients who underwent a variety of common procedures with a total of 3,314 different surgeons, including 774 females and 2,540 males.    Overall, patients treated by female surgeons were 12 percent less likely to die within 30 days, and they had similar complications rates and repeat hospital admissions, the study found.    “There are reasons to believe why female surgeons may have had these outcomes,” said senior study author Dr. Raj Satkunasivam, a researcher and surgeon at Houston Methodist Hospital.   “Surgery is a highly male dominated profession so that the cohort of females truly represents the ‘best of the best’ proportionately more skilled, motivated, and harder working surgeons who have had to perhaps pass a ‘higher bar’ to succeed,” Satkunasivam said by email.    Because the study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how surgeons’ sex influences patient outcomes, however, it’s possible that factors such as the complexity of individual cases might have influenced the results, Satkunasivam noted.    Still, the study should help dispel any biases against female surgeons in the medical profession, since the women clearly didn’t perform worse than the men, Satkunasivam and colleagues note in the BMJ.    The study focused on outcomes for 25 common procedures including a variety of heart operations, weight-loss surgeries, knee and hip replacements, and cancer treatments.   Overall, 11.1 percent of patients treated by female surgeons died, experienced serious complications or had repeat admissions to the hospital within 30 days of their operations, compared to 11.3 percent with male surgeons, the study found.   This translated into 4 percent lower odds of either death, complications or repeat admissions with female surgeons.    Researchers also accounted for differences in outcomes for procedures that were scheduled in advance, when patients can often choose their surgeon, and emergency operations, when patients typically do not make this choice.    One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked some data on patients that might impact their odds of death or complications, such as other medical problems or socioeconomic factors like income.    While the findings should dispel any lingering biases against female surgeons, it’s unlikely that the sex of the surgeon would be a good way to predict how well patients will do after their operations, Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and past-president Clare Marx write in an accompanying editorial.    However, the results do support giving female surgeons the same career opportunities as their male counterparts, said Dr. Heather Logghe, author of a separate accompanying editorial and a researcher at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.    “Given the historical exclusion of women from surgical training and today’s glass ceiling in terms of leadership positions, academic promotion, and pay equity among surgeons, this study is hugely impactful,” Logghe said by email. “It demonstrates that based on clinical outcomes there should be parity in leadership, promotion, and pay for women surgeons.”  "
2ziQiig,2017-10-18,Epidurals may not make labor last longer," (Reuters Health) - Giving pregnant women spinal anesthesia known as an epidural to ease their pain during the late stages of labor and delivery may not prolong the process, a new experiment suggests.                     FILE PHOTO: A pregnant woman, in the last trimester of her pregnancy, poses in this illustration photo in Sete, South France, March 26, 2016. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau       “Many obstetric providers believe that the numbness and weakness in a woman’s legs from epidural medications may affect a woman’s ability to push out a baby,” said senior study author Dr. Philip Hess, an anesthesiology researcher at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.   “Our study focused on this question, and we found that this is not true,” Hess said by email. “Continuing epidural medication while pushing had no effect whatsoever on the time it took a woman to deliver her baby, or any other measured variable.”   For the experiment, researchers randomly assigned 400 first-time mothers at a maternity hospital in Nanjing, China, to either continue or discontinue epidurals started earlier in labor when it came time to push.    The doctors and mothers didn’t know whether pain medication was continued during the second stage of labor, which starts when the cervix is fully dilated and women can begin to push.    That’s because all of the women kept catheters that were inserted to deliver pain medication earlier in labor. Half of them received pain medicine through the catheters while they pushed, and the rest of them got saline solutions that looked identical but contained no drugs.    With pain relief, the average time it took women to deliver babies once their cervix fully dilated was 52 minutes, compared to 51 minutes with saline, a difference that was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance, researchers report in Obstetrics & Gynecology.    There also wasn’t a meaningful difference in the proportion of women who had what’s known as spontaneous vaginal deliveries, when women don’t need interventions like drugs to induce labor, forceps or vacuums to help remove babies or surgical cesarean section deliveries.   With an epidural, 193 women, or 97 percent, had spontaneous vaginal deliveries, compared to 198, or 99 percent, with saline.    Not surprisingly, women reported higher pain levels and less satisfaction with their pain relief when they didn’t get continued epidural medication during delivery.   Doctors stopped epidurals during the second stage of labor in 38 cases when delivery wasn’t progressing quickly enough. It turned out that 17 of these patients were receiving saline, and 21 were getting epidural pain medicines.    One limitation of the study is that it was done at a single hospital, and labor and delivery or epidural protocols might differ elsewhere, researchers note. The results in Chinese first-time mothers also might not reflect what would happen for women with different racial or ethnic backgrounds or for women who had already had at least one baby.    Still, epidurals used today are much different than they were a generation ago, and the findings suggest it may be time for doctors to rethink their approach to pain relief during delivery, Hess said.    “Today’s epidural pain relief can be targeted to providing good pain relief with minimal weakness,” Hess said. “So much so that in some centers like my own, women are strong enough to be able to walk (the walking epidural).”   Even though it’s not yet clear if all women would experience results similar to what happened in the study, the results should reassure patients that the benefits of pain relief during the second stage of labor don’t come at the expense of a longer labor, said Dr. Joseph Wax, chair of the committee on obstetric practice for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and a researcher at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.   “The findings may encourage providers and women to continue epidural use for pain relief during the second stage without undue concerns regarding increasing labor duration,” Wax, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   "
2gh0513,2017-10-18,Cancer drug prices rising far faster than inflation," (Reuters Health) - The prices of injectable cancer drugs - even older medicines around since the 1990s - are increasing at a rate far higher than inflation, researchers report in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.   The study, led by Dr. Daniel Goldstein of Emory University in Atlanta, looked at 24 injectable cancer drugs approved since 1996 and found the average increase was 25 percent over eight years. After inflation, the average increase was 18 percent.    The prices of some drugs were going up by an average of 6 percent or more per year when the inflation rate was just under 1.1 percent.   The results come in the wake of widely publicized cases of drug price gouging, most notably for Turing Pharmaceuticals’ anti-parasite drug Daraprim and Mylan’s EpiPens, designed to prevent death after a severe allergic reaction. Among cancer drugs, Novartis’ Gleevec, which cost $26,000 in 2001 now costs more than $140,000, even though generic versions of the once-a-day pill are available.   “We knew about anecdotal stories of individual price increases, but we didn’t know what the overall landscape of price changes were for all these drugs. So we set out to analyze a wide selection,” Goldstein told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.   “What we’re seeing in this study is not those massive overnight hikes,” he said. “But we’re seeing a gradual price creep in these patented drugs, and over the course of 10 years, that gradual creep becomes significant.”   The team also found that, unlike just about every product, those increases were unaffected by the addition of competition, or the discovery of a new use for the medicine.   “Even when competitors enter the market, the price still continues to go up. You would expect, with more competitors, the price would go down,” Dr. Ravi Gupta of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, who reported on dramatic naloxone prices increases last year in a New England Journal of Medicine analysis, told Reuters Health by phone. He was not connected with the latest research.   Such increases are driving up health insurance costs and, in some cases, patients who are facing high out-of-pocket costs may be skimping on life-saving treatments because they can’t afford them.   When inflation was taken into account, only two of the 24 drugs tracked by the Goldstein team showed a decline. Nine averaged price hikes of at least 3 percent per year.   Some of the most striking examples among injectable drugs:   - Seattle Genetics’ brentuximab (brand name Adcetris), which cost $19,482 per month when it was introduced, has gone up 29 percent after inflation during the past four years.   - Spectrum Pharmaceutical’s liposomal vincristine (Marqibo), with a whopping monthly cost of $34,602, went up 18 percent in the past three years.   - Another Spectrum product, pralatrexate (Folotyn), which cost $31,684 at launch, rose in price by 31 percent over six years after inflation was taken into account.   Even the prices of older cancer drugs have been showing dramatic rises.   - Novartis’ nelarabine (Arranon), which typically cost $18,513 a month when it was launched, has logged a post-inflation increase of 55 percent over the past decade.   - Since 2005, Genetech and Biogen’s rituximab (Rituxan) has increased in price by 49 percent.   The study used average U.S. sales prices published by Medicare. Unlike other countries, the government-run Medicare program is prohibited by federal law from negotiating lower drug prices with manufacturers.   “In a normally functioning market, competition should decrease prices,” Goldstein said. “But we saw competition actually seems to drive prices up. We don’t specifically have evidence that the companies are talking to each other and raising their prices simultaneously, but one could consider that as a possible conclusion from these findings.”   “Cancer medications are some of the most expensive medications, particularly when they’re first launched. To see the price increase even after the launch is a significant addition to the conversation,” Gupta said.   With the new data on injectable cancer drugs, “We’re just providing an extra piece of the jigsaw puzzle in what’s happening in drug prices,” Goldstein said. “Some type of regulation is needed on drug pricing in many different settings - for generic, drugs, for drugs entering the markets and for what happens after their launch. It’s a complex issue.”  "
2yteKjG,2017-10-16,Some mothers may not seek early help for kids with developmental delays," (Reuters Health) - When mothers trust their friends and neighbors more than doctors or struggle to access or afford care, they may be less likely to seek out medical help for young kids with developmental delays, a small U.S. study suggests.    The study focused on kids who are eligible for therapy through what’s known as Early Intervention, a government program that funds services for infants and toddlers who have developmental delays in things like motor skills, communication, behavior and cognitive function. Fewer than one in four kids eligible for Early Intervention get services, researchers note in Pediatrics.    The study team interviewed 22 low-income mothers of African-American and Latino children up to 36 months old who qualified for Early Intervention.    All of the kids received routine well-child visits and had developmental delays.    But 59 percent of the mothers said their children had never enrolled in Early Intervention.    “In the United States, one in four children under the age of 5 years is at moderate to high risk of developmental delay, a situation in which children do not achieve motor, language, cognitive, social or adaptive skills when they should,” said lead study author Dawn Magnusson of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora.   “Many mothers in our study experienced challenges accessing early intervention services due to logistical challenges or competing social and financial stressors that resulted in delayed or forgone care,” Magnusson said by email. “These findings highlight the importance of supporting families throughout the referral process and helping to address their social and financial needs.”   Only two mothers in the study had attended college, and 13 had not completed high school.    All eight of the African-American women in the study were born in the U.S., while 11 of the Latino women were from Mexico and the rest were from Central America. Only seven of the Latino mothers had been in the U.S. for 10 years or more.    A majority of the kids had developmental delays in expressive communication; motor delays were the second most common problem.    Few mothers, however, identified their child as having developmental delays, the interviews found.    Often, women said they believed all children developed at their own pace, or that children who lagged in one area seemed to be ahead in other areas that made their mothers question whether the child could have developmental delays.    Women seemed more open to Early Intervention when they had friends who had found these services helpful for their children.    Scheduling pressures, finances and other logistics and competing obligations made it hard for some women to start or continue Early Intervention services for their child.    Beyond its small size, another limitation of the study is that all of the mothers interviewed had kids who received regular medical care. Parents of kids who don’t get routine well-child checkups might have different beliefs about Early Intervention than the women in the study, the authors note.    Mothers of other racial or ethnic backgrounds, and fathers, might also have different perspectives about Early Intervention.    Even so, the findings highlight the importance of parental beliefs in determining what treatment children may get for developmental delays, said Dimity Dornan, founder and executive director of Hear and Say, an advocacy group for kids with delays based in Brisbane, Australia.   “One has to believe there is a problem and have the time and education to take an active role,” Dornan, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “Children’s brains need to learn basic skills (like crawling) before other skills (like walking) can be learned,” Dornan added. “If one of the building blocks in development is missing, then the gap between what a delayed child can do physically and what a typical child can do just get larger and larger as the child gets older.”  "
2zlSHtx,2017-10-13,Aspirin habits unchanged by recommendations from U.S. doctors," (Reuters Health) - U.S. guidelines urging more adults who never had a heart attack or stroke to take a daily aspirin may not have convinced people to take these pills, a recent study suggests.    In 2009, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a government-backed panel of independent physicians, advised men ages 45 to 79 and women ages 55 to 79 to take aspirin to prevent heart attack and stroke as long as they didn’t have bleeding disorders that might make the drug unsafe.    To see whether people in that age range took the advice, researchers examined data from 2007 to 2015 on aspirin use for almost 89,000 men and women who didn’t have bleeding disorders or other medical reasons to avoid this drug. Overall, only 43 percent of these adults took aspirin during the study period.   Even after researchers looked at how many risk factors people had for cardiovascular disease – such as high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol and smoking – the 2009 recommendations didn’t appear to boost aspirin use, researchers report in the Journal of the American Heart Association.    After 2009, aspirin use declined from 45 percent to 40 percent among people at low risk for heart attacks and strokes; from 66 percent to 62 percent among people at medium risk; and from 76 percent to 73 percent among high-risk individuals.    “There are many examples of preventive therapies that are underutilized and are minimally affected by publication of recommendation,” said lead study author Dr. Jeremy Van’t Hof of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.   “The challenge with any therapy for prevention is the fact that you are attempting to make a change in a patient who feels well with no manifestation of disease,” Van’t Hof said by email. “It is much easier to convince someone to treat a broken arm or a pneumonia because they can see and feel the problem.”   Last year, the USPSTF updated its aspirin recommendations, advising adults aged 50 to 59 who have at least a 10 percent risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years to take aspirin every day.    The American College of Cardiology provides an online risk calculator here:  here    The advice doesn’t apply to people in their 60s because the bleeding risk increases with age, however, and the jury is still out on whether this approach makes sense for people under 50 or over 70, the Task Force concluded in its most recent recommendations.    Many patients who haven’t had a heart attack or stroke will see a primary care provider and not a cardiologist, and the new study findings suggest that many of these patients aren’t getting the message that they may benefit from aspirin, said Dr. Ying Xian, a researcher at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “What is surprising here is that many patients with intermediate cardiovascular disease risk did not take aspirin for no apparent reasons,” Xian said by email. “This represents a missed opportunity for heart disease and stroke prevention.”   One limitation of the study, however, is that it looked at health records from patients seen in primary care, which may not represent all people at risk for cardiovascular disease or capture patients who take aspirin without a prescription, Dr. Samuel Wann, a researcher at Ascension Healthcare in Milwaukee who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Even so, the findings add to the evidence that aspirin is underused as a tool to prevent heart disease, said Dr. Gregg Fonarow of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.    “Prior studies have also shown that release of guidelines or national recommendations alone is not sufficient to influence care or treatment of patients,” Fonarow, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “To better ensure evidence-based, guideline-recommended, well calibrated, aspirin use, performance improvement systems need to be implemented in all care settings.”  "
2wTQFz8,2017-10-13,Little evidence new cancer drugs improve survival," (Reuters Health) - There’s not much evidence to show that most new cancer drugs approved in Europe in recent years can help patients live longer or improve their quality of life, a recent study suggests.    Researchers looked at 48 cancer drugs approved by the European Medicines Agency for 68 different uses from 2009 to 2013.    At the time of approval, just 24 of the 68 uses for these new medications, or 35 percent, had evidence showing the drugs were better at helping patients live longer compared to dummy pills or alternative treatments, researchers report in The BMJ. The survival benefit ranged from about 1 to 6 months, and half the time was no more than 2.7 months.    The evidence was even weaker for quality of life improvements, which at the time of approval were documented for just 7 of the 68 new uses of these new medicines, researchers found.    “This does not necessarily mean that patients are taking unsafe or ineffective medicines,” said lead study author Dr. Courtney Davis of Kings College London.   “What it means is that for around half of all new drugs coming on the market in the European Union, patients and physicians will not know whether the drugs offer survival or quality of life benefits over existing treatment options, or in some cases over no treatment,” Davis said by email. “It also means that where survival benefits have been shown, they may not be worth the risk of side effects or additional toxicity for some patients.”   Many newer, targeted cancer medicines have offered fresh hope to patients with tumors that don’t respond to older drugs, but many of these new medicines carry hefty price tags in excess of $100,000 a year.    Because some cancers grow slowly and can affect a large proportion of the population, studies to prove a survival benefit may need to run for decades and include large numbers of participants. This has prompted many new cancer drug trials to focus on different goals. For example, instead of proving that a drug helps patients live longer, studies may aim to show how long the drug keeps the tumor from growing larger.    This has led doctors and regulators to question the necessity of some new treatments, particularly medicines approved based on studies that don’t document an overall survival benefit.    “While it makes sense to use drugs that shrink cancer and slow growth, the reality is sometimes we do that, but a person doesn’t live any longer,” said Dr. Vinay Prasad, author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.   For some recently approved cancer drugs, companies agreed to do additional studies testing for overall survival benefits as a condition of winning permission to sell the drugs.    In the current study, after at least 3.3 years on the market, most of the new medicines still lacked conclusive evidence that they helped people live longer or offered patients a better quality of life.    Among the 23 new uses out of 68 studied that had a survival benefit that could be assessed by researchers, only half were found to be clinically meaningful for patients, the study also found.    “Some of these medicines probably do offer benefits, but we don’t know how much because trials are not done,” Prasad said by email. “But I also think many of these medicines don’t offer benefits, only harms and side effects.”   Patients considering treatment with these newer medicines should focus on what proof there is that the drug will achieve the goal that’s most important in their situation, whether it’s survival or quality of life, Prasad advised.    “Forget about asking your doctor how a new drug works,” Prasad said. “Forget all the hype you read. The only question to ask is what is the proof this drugs makes patients better off.”  "
2geLlmH,2017-10-13,"Nursing degrees increasing, but not on track to meet goal for acute care"," (Reuters Health) - The proportion of registered nurses with nursing bachelor’s degrees has climbed in recent years to 57 percent in U.S. acute care settings, but it’s not rising fast enough to reach a goal of 80 percent by the year 2020, researchers say.   “When more nurses have degrees, there’s a higher quality of care, lower mortality rate and better patient outcomes,” said lead author Chenjuan Ma of New York University’s Rory Meyers College of Nursing in New York City.    Nurses make up the largest healthcare workforce in the U.S., with 2.75 million registered nurses in 2014 and 1.6 million of these working in hospitals, the study team notes in the Journal of Nursing Scholarship.   “On one side, we’re happy to see that the number of nurses is increasing,” Ma told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “On the other side, we need to put more effort and commitment into increasing these numbers even more.”   Ma and colleagues analyzed data from the National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators covering more than 2,000 units in 377 hospitals across the country. The research team looked specifically at nurses working in acute care units, which can include intensive care units, cardiology floors, emergency departments and other parts of a hospital where patients with serious conditions need continual and sometimes complex care.   In these settings, the proportion of nurses with a bachelor’s degree in nursing rose from 44 percent in 2004 to 57 percent in 2013, the study found.    In particular, the researchers paid attention to trends after the U.S. Institute of Medicine’s 2010 Future of Nursing report, which raised an alarm about an overall nursing shortage and a growing need for educated nurses to take care of aging patients in a complicated healthcare system. The report set a goal of 80 percent of nurses obtaining bachelor’s degrees by 2020.   The study found that this proportion bumped up an average of 1.3 percent each year before 2010 and 1.9 percent each year after 2010.    At the same time, the proportion of units where 80 percent of nurses had a bachelor’s or higher degree rose from 3 percent in 2009 to 7 percent in 2013.    Based on current trends, Ma and her colleagues estimate that 64 percent of nurses in acute care hospital units will have a degree by 2020. The 80 percent goal won’t likely be reached until 2029.   “Senior nurses with a lot of experience are retiring, and we’re concerned about how to replace that wealth of experience,” said Joanne Spetz, a health policy researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Having a higher education level doesn’t necessarily replace experience, but it’s one of the strongest strategies we have, and patient outcomes show it works,” she told Reuters Health by phone.   “Millions of American have inadequate access to primary care, and health insurance expansions continue to build demand, but supply won’t be able to match that,” said Peter Buerhaus, a registered nurse and healthcare economist at Montana State University in Bozeman who wasn’t involved in the study.   “When compared to other fields, nurses are really satisfied with their decision to go into nursing,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “It has economic security, is a recession-proof profession and has a range of opportunities, particularly if you have a nursing degree.”   National nursing groups are also debating the positives and negatives of requiring a bachelor’s degree in nursing for entry-level nursing positions, said Olga Yakusheva, an economist at the University of Michigan School of Nursing in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Nurses and aspiring nurses ought not to misinterpret the upcoming nursing shortage to mean any kind of nurse will soon be in high demand,” Yakusheva told Reuters Health by email.   “If you want to be a nurse, you should be prepared to dedicate yourself to getting at least a baccalaureate nursing degree,” she said. “In this era of high technologies and informatics, nurses are expected to be highly-trained in all aspects of patient care and prepared to participate and lead in system-level decision making.”  "
2xNS1fP,2017-10-12,"After concussion, teen girls may take longer to heal than boys"," (Reuters Health) - Female adolescent athletes may take more than twice as long to recover from concussions as their male counterparts, a small study suggests.    Researchers examined data on 110 male and 102 female athletes, ranging in age from 11 to 18 years, who sustained their first concussion while participating in sports.    Half of the girls reported still having symptoms at least 28 days after sustaining a concussion, while half of the boys no longer had symptoms after 11 days, the study found.   “We have known for at least the last decade that females who participate in similar sports as males have higher rates of concussion,” said Dr. Mark Halstead, director of the Sports Concussion Clinic at St. Louis Children’s Hospital.   “Boys and girls likely have different recovery courses, but we have to treat each concussion individually,” Halstead, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Adult coaches need to create an environment and culture for their players that stresses that a concussion is an important injury to not downplay and encourage the reporting of symptoms.”   Concussions represent almost 9 percent of all injuries in high school athletics, note Dr. John Neidecker, a sports concussion specialist in Raleigh, North Carolina, and his colleagues in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association.    Emergency room visits for sports concussions have surged in recent years due to both heightened awareness of these injuries and the increased intensity and duration of practices and competitions, they write.    To assess the duration of symptoms, the researchers examined patient records for young athletes treated for concussions at one medical practice in New Jersey from 2011 to 2013. The athletes were 15 years old on average.    Injured boys most often participated in football, soccer, wrestling, lacrosse and ice hockey. Most of the girls who sustained concussions participated in soccer, basketball, softball, field hockey or cheerleading.    Overall, 75 percent of the boys recovered from their concussions within three weeks, compared to just 42 percent of girls.    There wasn’t a statistically meaningful difference in recovery time based on the type of sport played or whether athletes were participating in middle school or high school athletics.    Beyond its small size and focus on a single medical practice, another limitation of the study is that the medical records rely on teens to accurately recall and report their own symptoms during exams, the authors note. The researchers also didn’t have a complete picture of the circumstances that caused concussions or the severity of injuries.    It’s also possible that some of the difference in recovery time for boys and girls was due to pre-existing medical conditions, said Dr. Monica Vavilala, director of the Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center (HIPRC) at the University of Washington in Seattle.    “More females had preexisting migraines and mental illness which may be very important and more so than inherent biological differences,” Vavilala, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Larger studies that specifically examine sex biology are needed to understand the effect of sex on recovery trajectory after concussion.”   While more severe concussions can produce more serious and lasting impairments, the study also didn’t detail the extent of cognitive, balance, vision or other symptoms, noted Anthony Kontos, research director of the Sports Medicine Concussion Program at the University of Pittsburgh.   “First and foremost, the current findings highlight the importance of seeking proper care following a concussion,” Kontos, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “There are a lot of treatment interventions from behavioral management to vestibular and vision therapy that help athletes recover from concussions,” Kontos added. “However, a large number - estimates are as high as 55 to 60 percent - of young athletes with concussions do not receive clinical care beyond the initial diagnosis.”      "
2kIij09,2017-10-12,Even slightly-early birth linked to lower cardiorespiratory fitness," (Reuters Health) - Babies born a little early, but still within the range considered “full term,” may have worse cardiorespiratory fitness than peers born after a full 39 weeks of gestation, suggests a recent study.   Cardiorespiratory fitness reflects the body’s ability to supply oxygen to muscles during physical activity. It also affects metabolic and cardiovascular health, the study authors note in the Journal of the American Heart Association.   “There is an increasing trend toward earlier deliveries of babies that can be almost fully attributed to an increase in rates of induced or caesarian section deliveries after 37 weeks but before 39 completed weeks of gestation, when not medically necessary (i.e. elective/planned deliveries),” lead author Isabel Ferreira told Reuters Health by email.   “It is becoming increasingly evident that shorter gestation, even within the at-term period, may lead to higher rates of adverse health outcomes, such as respiratory and neurological morbidity and mortality in neonates and infants,” said Ferreira, a researcher at The University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.   Poor cardiorespiratory fitness is a major determinant of metabolic and cardiovascular health during youth and later in life, as well as a strong determinant of individuals’ longevity, Ferreira said.   The researchers looked at data from the Northern Ireland Young Hearts Project, a study that followed the development of cardiovascular risk factors through adolescence to young adulthood. They also had data on the participants’ gestational age at birth and maternal health and habits.   The study team included 791 participants born within the full-term range of 37-42 weeks of gestation. Their cardiorespiratory fitness was determined at ages 12, 15 and 22 years by measuring their maximal oxygen uptake level after undergoing standardized physical tests.    Compared to kids born at full-term (39-40 weeks) and late-term (41-42 weeks), those born early-term (37-38 weeks) were about 57 percent more likely to have poor cardiorespiratory fitness during adolescence and young adulthood, the study found.    This was true after researchers adjusted for a variety of other factors that could influence fitness, such as age, weight, diet, physical activity, smoking behavior, maternal health and smoking and household income.   In addition, researchers found that each week of increase in gestational age was associated with a 14 percent reduction in risk for poor cardiorespiratory fitness.    The study team notes that early births may interrupt normal development of the lungs and other organs that would take place in the final few weeks of pregnancy.     “Of course, not all early term deliveries can be prevented, for instance, if due to obstetric reasons or if they occur spontaneously. But those earlier deliveries that are planned without medical indication could be prevented in view of their potential lifelong impact on the offspring health,” Ferreira said.   In other words, mothers and healthcare providers should be informed of the lifelong health risks that early-term deliveries may have on their offspring, and refrain from these unless there is a medical indication to anticipate deliveries, she added.   “I think it tells us again that those weeks in utero are active, and things are happening, but I think that it needs to be validated with other information,” said Dr. Mary Ann Bauman, a primary care physician and women’s health advocate in Seattle, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “It’s emerging science we don’t know how valid it is. But I think if women have a choice, they’re always anxious to get their last few weeks of pregnancy over. It’s the time when you’re feeling large and uncomfortable etc, there may be some benefit to waiting a bit longer,” she said.   Bauman added that she doesn’t want to scare women who for whatever reason need to have a birth induced early. The authors of the study point out, she added, that exercise can improve cardiorespiratory fitness.    “The American Heart Association is recommending that we start with exercise early in life,” Bauman said.  "
2hAVarZ,2017-10-11,Prostate cancer patients unclear on differences among treatments," (Reuters Health) - Many patients with localized prostate cancer don’t understand the differences between their treatment options, a new study suggests.   “Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in Western Europe, but this study shows that men facing treatment have a poor understanding of how their treatment decision will affect their lives,” Marie-Anne Van Stam of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands told Reuters Health in an email interview.     “This means that they are often not able to understand the differences in outcomes and side effects among the different treatment options, and end up making decisions on instinct.”   Options for treating prostate cancer that hasn’t spread include removal of the prostate gland, radiation therapy and active surveillance, in which doctors monitor the cancer but don’t treat it unless it grows.    While radical prostatectomy is the most invasive approach, it does not reduce the risk of disease recurrence compared to radiation therapy. Patients who undergo surgical treatment face a higher risk of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction, while radiation treatment is associated with bowel and urinary problems, the researchers note in the journal BJU International.   Van Stam and her team analyzed questionnaires completed by 474 prostate cancer patients who had just received information about their treatment options from a urologist.    Just over one-third of the patients were aware that cancer recurrence was just as likely with surgery as with radiation, while 39 percent were aware that prostatectomy increased the risk of incontinence. Twenty percent knew that 10-year mortality is similar with active surveillance, radiation and surgery.    Forty-five percent of the survey respondents thought that patients on active surveillance always wound up receiving radiation or therapy later on. In fact, according to Van Stam, only half of patients on active surveillance require definitive treatment.   Patients who spoke to a nurse specialist or radiotherapist in addition to the urologist had a better understanding of the differences between treatments. “This finding encourages the incorporation of a nurse specialist and/or multidisciplinary consults in routine care,” Van Stam said.   “We don’t expect patients to become experts in prostate cancer, this is a once in a lifetime thing for them,” she added.    “So the facts need to come from clinicians. However, we note for example that almost no clinical guidelines include a clear overview of the differences in the risks of side effects among treatment, or sections on communicating with patients, and this needs to change.”  "
2xzSTbi,2017-10-11,Marital ups and downs tied to shifts in heart health," (Reuters Health) - Married men who see their relationship with their spouse improve over the years may also experience positive changes in their health that can lower the risk of heart disease, a recent U.K. study suggests.   Researchers examined data on 620 married fathers to see what they thought of their relationship when their child was almost 3 years old and again when their child was 9. The study team also assessed risk factors for heart disease like blood pressure, cholesterol, weight and blood sugar.   “We found little change in cardiovascular risk factors for those whose relationships were consistently good or bad,” said lead study author Dr. Ian Bennett-Britton of the University of Bristol.   But changes in marriage were associated with shifts in heart health, the study found.   “Improving relationships were linked with lower levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL, bad cholesterol) and relatively lower weight when compared to those in consistently good relationships,” Bennett-Britton said by email. “Deteriorating relationships, on the other hand, were linked with worsening blood pressure.”   All of the men in the study were part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), which began in 1991.   The researchers assessed the fathers’ blood pressure, resting heart rate, weight, cholesterol and blood sugar levels between 2011 and 2013 when their children were nearly 19 years old.    Changes in these risk factors can take time to develop and the absolute shifts detected in the study were small, researchers note in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.   After accounting for other factors that can influence the odds of heart disease such as age, educational attainment, short stature and household income, improving relationships were associated with slightly lowered (by about 0.25 mmol/liter) levels of LDL cholesterol.   Relationship improvements were also linked to falling weight based on a measure known as body-mass index (BMI), a ratio of weight to height. Compared to those with a steadily good marriage, men with an improving marriage had BMI scores that fell by an average 1.07 BMI units, or the equivalent of about 10 pounds.   Deteriorating relationships, meanwhile, were tied to worsening diastolic blood pressure, the “bottom number” that indicates how much pressure the blood exerts on artery walls when the heart rests between beats. Diastolic blood pressure was 2.74 millimeters of mercury higher when men reported worsening marital quality.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how marriage quality influences heart health.    Men were only about 36 years old at the start of the study, and it’s possible that they were still too young by the end of the study for researchers to see meaningful changes in risk factors for heart disease. That’s because many of these risk factors take years to develop.    Still, the results add to growing evidence suggesting that marriage can influence health, said Brian Chin, a psychology researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh who wasn’t involved in the study.    It’s possible that shifts in the amount or quality of sleep occur in tandem with changes in marriage quality, and that this influences risk factors for heart disease, Chin said by email.    Improvements or declines in marital relationships might also be associated with changes in mental health or physical health, especially if different eating, exercising, smoking or drinking habits accompany these shifts.   “It’s interesting that improvements or deteriorations in marital quality are associated with changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors and surprising that consistently good or bad quality marriages were mostly unassociated,” Chin said.     “This seems to be suggesting that it’s something about the transition from having a good marriage that you feel provides you with support, care and warmth to a bad marriage marked by the absence of affection or appreciation that’s particularly relevant for cardiovascular disease risk,” Chin added.

2wLrLS9,2017-10-11,U.S. government undercounted civilians killed by police," (Reuters Health) - U.S. police killed 1,166 people - more than three a day - in 2015, but an official government count missed a majority of the deaths, a new study shows.    The Guardian, a U.K.-based newspaper and media company with U.S. and international editions, counted 93 percent of the U.S. police-related deaths, while the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics counted only 45 percent, the report in PLOS Medicine found.   “It is kind of absurd that a British newspaper is able to do a better job counting the number of killings by police than the CDC or the Department of Justice,” said lead author Justin M. Feldman, a doctoral candidate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.   “If we as a society want to improve policing and have fewer deaths, we need better data about the circumstances of these deaths to improve training, policies and to hold police departments accountable,” he said in a phone interview.   Feldman and his team matched police-related deaths reported in the Guardian’s series “The Counted” ( bit.ly/2dgQzLC ) to those reported in the CDC’s National Vital Statistics System (NVSS).     The government based its count on diagnosis codes in state death certificates indicating that “legal intervention” was involved in the death and has long been suspected of significant underreporting. The Guardian, which has suspended its count, drew on news stories and crowd-sourced information.    Researchers estimated that the Guardian missed 80 of the estimated 1,166 deaths and the CDC missed a majority of them: 643 police killings.   In most cases, official records appear to have omitted police killings because a medical examiner or coroner failed to mention law-enforcement involvement on the death certificate, Feldman said.   Police killings most likely to be missed were those by means other than firearms, particularly due to Taser shocks, and those outside the highest-income counties, the study found.    Deaths of children and blacks were more likely to be missed than to be reported in the official government count.   Some states were far more successful in capturing deaths at the hands of police than others. In Oklahoma, police killed 30 civilians in 2015, but none of those deaths was included in the federal government count, Feldman said.   Feldman proposed that states be required to report police-related deaths, like they’re now required to report some communicable diseases, and that public health agencies employ local news reports, as the Guardian did, to properly classify and count law-enforcement deaths.   The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting program requires U.S. law-enforcement agencies to report a host of incidents, but it does not require reporting of civilians killed in police interactions, said Cassandra Crifasi, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health’s Center for Gun Policy and Research in Baltimore.    “There is mounting pressure to increase law-enforcement transparency and accountability. One necessary component to that is having an accurate count of the number of people killed by police,” she said by email.    “Understanding the basic epidemiology of a problem is the first step toward identifying potential interventions and monitoring their effects,” said Crifasi, who was not involved in the new research.   The study’s senior author Nancy Krieger, a professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also called for better government data.   “As with any public health outcome or exposure, the only way to understand the magnitude of the problem, and whether it is getting better or worse, requires that data be uniformly, validly, and reliably obtained throughout the U.S.,” she said in a news release.   “Our results show our country is falling short of accurately monitoring deaths due to law enforcement, and work is needed to remedy this problem,” she said.  "
2i2wpsk,2017-10-10,Many patients remain confused about medical hierarchy," (Reuters Health) - Patients continue to be confused about the roles and responsibilities different doctors play in their health care, new research confirms.   In a new study, gynecology patients receiving treatment at a teaching hospital did not fully understand the differences between an attending physician, a resident doctor and a medical student.   “Most patients don’t realize that in a teaching hospital, it’s the residents that are doing the majority of the work,” Dr. Ronald Blatt, Medical Director of the Manhattan Center for Vaginal Surgery in New York City, told Reuters Health in a phone interview.    Dr. Catherine Flood of the University of Alberta and colleagues surveyed 108 women awaiting major gynecological surgery. Questions assessed patients’ knowledge of residents’ responsibilities as compared with duties of medical students and attending physicians. In addition, researchers measured patients’ comfort level with resident doctors.   Most women - 83 percent - understood that residents “had a higher level of training” than medical students, but only 60 percent realized that a resident is actually a doctor, the authors report in the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada.   That might explain why only 50 percent of respondents indicated that they would feel comfortable with a resident operating on them, even under the supervision of a practicing physician.   “Typically, patients are under the impression that (surgical) residents merely assist in pre-and post-operative procedures when, in reality, they are performing the actual surgery,” said Blatt, who was not involved with the new study. “This, of course, is only when the practicing physician is fully confident in the resident’s capability. It’s actually one of the benefits of getting treatment at a teaching hospital. There are more practitioners keeping a close eye on things compared to non-teaching hospitals.”    Residents have graduated from medical school. They practice in teaching hospitals or clinics under the direct or indirect supervision of an attending physician for several years before deciding on a sub-specialty. But it’s important to note that “resident” can mean anything from a first-year intern who is just out of medical school to a chief resident who is in his or her final year of training.   In this study, while 92 percent of the women surveyed believed in the importance of knowing their doctor’s level of training, only 63 percent reported actually having such knowledge. Fifty-six percent of those polled reported a desire to learn more about the role of resident doctors.   “Considering the significant role of residents in patient care, educating patients is essential to improve their comfort and the overall consent process,” the authors write.   This study is the first of its kind in the gynecological discipline, but there are a few limitations worth noting. The sample size was small and comprised only of a region-specific Canadian cohort, which limits the generalizability of the results.   To promote a better understanding among patients, the researchers suggest “placing placards throughout teaching hospitals, handing out pamphlets in waiting rooms, or reviewing consent forms in greater depth in the office setting.”   Previous research, they note, shows that informed patients tend to be more actively involved in their own care and have better health outcomes than their uninformed counterparts.   “Considering the valuable role that residents play in patient care, educating patients about their providers is essential to improve their satisfaction, comfort, and the overall value of the consent process,” the researchers conclude.

2yNBGax,2017-10-09,Injuries on stairs occur in all age groups and abilities," (Reuters Health) - More than 1 million Americans injure themselves on stairs each year, according to a study in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine.                    FILE PHOTO: A boy walks down stairs during snowfall at Central Park in New York, December 17, 2013. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton      Older adults, younger children and women reported more injuries, but all ages show up in emergency departments for sprains, strains, bumps and fractures.   “Stairs are a common source of injury among all ages, and the frequency and rate of stair-related injuries are increasing,” said senior author Dr. Gary Smith of Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.   About half of homes in the United States contain stairs, according to the Census Bureau, and the direct and indirect costs of non-fatal stair injuries total about $92 billion annually, the study team notes.   “This underscores the need for increased prevention efforts, particularly those related to stair design and construction,” Smith told Reuters Health by email.   The researchers analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System on injuries involving stairs that were treated in emergency departments between 1990 and 2012.   They found nearly 25 million patients treated in ERs over those 23 years, representing an average rate of about 38 stair-related injuries per 10,000 U.S. residents annually, which is about 3,000 per day or one injury every 30 seconds.    Injury rates fell by about 13 percent during the early part of the study period, from 1990 to 1996, but then rose by 24 percent from 1996 to 2012, the study found. About 62 percent of patients were women and more than 60 percent of injuries happened at home.   Adults over age 85, children under 3 years old and young adults in their 20s had the highest injury rates, but over two thirds of the emergency department visitors were a mix of ages between 11 and 60 years old.    “This study was unable to identify the reasons for the higher injury rates among women,” the study authors write. “However, these are the child-bearing and parenting years . . . that could include increased exposure to stairs related to greater time in the home while caring for children and performing household chores.”   Nearly 94 percent of patients were treated and released from the hospital, but 6 percent were admitted for treatment of fractures or concussions. The most common types of injuries were sprains, strains, scrapes, bruises and broken bones. Kids under age 10 had more head injuries while older patients had more fractures, which often required hospitalization.    Overall, about 60 percent of injuries happened without a cause, according to the patients’ accounts. Twenty-three percent of patients said they slid, slipped, tripped or misstepped. A small number said they were carrying objects and couldn’t see.    Future research should look at stair design and safety, the study authors write. To help prevent accidents, new stair construction and remodels could increase the horizontal surfaces for the foot to step on, for instance. Horizontal and vertical surfaces should also be uniform to prevent missteps, they note.   An example of a common tripping hazard, the study team, points out, is a missing nosing - the part of the tread that overhangs a stair - on the top step. Stair patterns may also throw off people at the last step, causing a bottom-of-stair illusion.    “The term ‘slips, trips and falls’ is a major misstatement of the full complexity of all possible missteps,” said Jake Pauls, a building safety consultant in Toronto, Canada, and Silver Spring, Maryland, who researches stairway safety and usability but wasn’t involved in the study.    “Underlying societal factors have led (in all countries) to a double standard and lower standard for home stairways compared to those in all other settings (such as workplaces),” Pauls told Reuters Health by email.   Handrails with a “power grip,” which allows the entire hand to grab the rail rather than just the fingers, reduce more severe injuries during a fall. Slippery surfaces and loose carpeting can cause issues, too.   “Revising building codes and updating existing stairways to comply with geometric dimensions are recommended for optimal safety,” Smith said. “People can also reduce injuries by keeping stairs clear of clutter, ensuring stairways are well-lit and not multitasking while navigating the stairs.”  "
2y5Wmvh,2017-10-09,Aggressive breast cancer treatment tied to more missed work," (Reuters Health) - Many women with early-stage breast cancer have full-time jobs when they’re diagnosed, and they are more likely to miss at least a month of work when they receive aggressive treatment that includes surgery, a U.S. study suggests.    The majority of women in the study had surgery - either a lumpectomy that removes malignant tissue while sparing the rest of the breast or a mastectomy that removes the entire breast. Afterwards, many of them also got chemotherapy or radiation to destroy any remaining abnormal cells and reduce the risk of cancer coming back.   Women who received the most aggressive treatment - a double mastectomy followed by breast reconstruction surgery - were almost eight times more likely to miss a month or more of work than women who got a lumpectomy, the study found. With a double mastectomy and reconstruction, women were also three times more likely to stop working altogether.    “We know that many of the women who are receiving (double) mastectomy do not have advanced tumors that require mastectomy even on the affected side,” said lead study author Dr. Reshma Jagsi of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.    All of the women had early breast cancer, meaning the tumors had not spread beyond the breast and nearby lymph nodes. Survival odds are generally much better for women diagnosed with these early-stage tumors than for patients with tumors that have metastasized, or spread to other organs in the body.    “Many of the women who are considering more aggressive surgery tell me that they are considering this because they want to make sure they will be there for those who depend on them, both at home and at work,” Jagsi said by email. “For most women with early-stage breast cancer, lumpectomy with radiation therapy is an option, will yield equivalent overall survival to mastectomy, and will actually be less likely to disrupt their ability to be there for others.”   For the study, researchers examined data on 1,006 working women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer in 2014 and 2015. Overall, 84 percent were working full-time before their diagnosis, but only half of them had paid sick leave and just 38 percent had disability benefits.   When women got chemotherapy, they were 30 percent more likely to miss at least a month of work than when they didn’t receive these drugs, the study found. Chemotherapy was also associated with roughly four times the odds that women would stop work altogether.    Among women who missed more than a month of work, 29 percent lost more than $5,000 in income, researchers report in the journal Cancer.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how different treatment options directly cause missed work or lost wages. Another limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on why women missed work, and it’s possible some of that time wasn’t related to the type of treatment they received.    Because the vast majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer can be cured, and because more aggressive care doesn’t necessarily improve survival odds, it makes sense for patients to consider the financial or career impacts of treatment to help decide what makes sense for them, said Dr. Michael Hassett of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston.    “Women should start by figuring out what treatment has the best chance of curing their cancer,” Hassett, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “If more than one effective treatment exists, then patients should look for the treatment option that has the least impact on employment or whatever is most relevant to her.”   Too often, discussions women have with their doctors about the best treatment options don’t include a conversation about the employment impact, said Dr. Benjamin Smith, of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.    “This needs to change,” Smith, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Patients need to understand how their choices may influence their employment, and patients need assistance to help ensure their treatment choices are truly shared decisions that weigh the potential employment impact of given treatment options.”  "
2y5qetk,2017-10-06,Some police and retailers may store guns to help prevent suicide," (Reuters Health) - Most law enforcement agencies and many gun retailers may be willing to temporarily store firearms to help prevent suicide, a recent U.S. study suggests.    Half of suicide deaths in the U.S. involve guns, and the vast majority of attempted suicides with firearms result in death, researchers note in the American Journal of Public Health. Access to firearms can also make people more likely to consider and attempt suicide, some previous research has found.    For the current study, researchers surveyed 448 law enforcement agencies and 95 gun retailers in eight states about their willingness to store guns and their recommendations about safe firearm storage.    Overall, 75 percent of law enforcement agencies and 48 percent of retailers said they offered temporary gun storage, the study found.   “Discovering the willingness and the kinds of circumstances in which these community-based organizations will voluntarily store guns for families is important to share with mental and physical health care providers as well as with families,” said lead study author Carol Runyan of the Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora.    Law enforcement agencies were most willing to consider this when gun owners expressed concerns about the mental health of a family member who might attempt suicide, while retailers were more receptive than police to storing firearms when a gun owner had houseguests or was going away on vacation.    Both retailers and police recommended locking guns inside the home, but law enforcement agencies were slightly more likely to suggest keeping firearms outside the home, the study also found.    The survey was sent to law enforcement agencies and gun retailers in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.    While the process and laws for gun storage may vary, with some places requiring background checks or charging fees, the findings suggest that it makes sense for families to explore their options for keeping firearms outside the home when suicide is a concern, Runyan said by email.    Guns in the home should be stored locked, unloaded and separate from ammunition.   One limitation of the study is that it didn’t explore what motivated law enforcement agencies or retailers to consider or refuse gun storage.   “If local police agencies or firearm retailers do not provide services, the family should consider loaning the firearm to another family member, checking with banks for safe deposit boxes, self-storage facilities, shooting ranges or even pawn shops,” said Russell Griffin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the study.   Each place may have their own rules, and the family would need to ensure that guns are allowed, Griffin said by email. Usually explosives such as ammunition are not permitted, but it’s usually legal to give the gun to a family member as long as they don’t have a felony conviction or other criminal history that prevents having weapons, he added.    Offsite storage is the best option because it creates the biggest barrier to getting a gun, said Dr. Joseph Simonetti of the VA Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center at the Denver VA Medical Center.   “Many suicidal crises are extremely brief,” Simonetti, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “One study found that about 25 percent of those who survived a suicide attempt only waited 5 minutes before they decided to end their life to take action,” Simonetti said. “So any step that increases the time and distance between a person in crisis and a lethal action will save lives.”  "
2kqREFf,2017-10-06,"Anxiety, depression greatest in younger kids with facial birth defects"," (Reuters Health) - Elementary school children with cleft lip, cleft palate and other facial anomalies may struggle more than older kids with anger, anxiety, depression and stress, according to a recent study.   Compared to older kids and teens, those between ages 8 and 10 have the highest risk for psychosocial dysfunction, the study team reports in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.   “The ultimate goal for all of us who work in craniofacial surgery is to help kids feel better and grow up normally,” said senior author Dr. Justine Lee of the University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine.   “At first, we weren’t looking for differences in age but other factors such as health insurance, socioeconomic status or how many surgeries they had over time,” she told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “It surprised us to find out how tough elementary school was, realizing somebody else is different and noticing your own differences.”   The researchers surveyed 99 patients at the UCLA Craniofacial Clinic ranging in age from 8 to 17 years. The survey asked the girls and boys to recall how they felt in the past week, including anger, anxiety and depression, as well as how social interactions made them feel.      When researchers split participants into groups aged 8-10, 11-13 and 14-17, they found that the 8-10 age group showed the highest anxiety and depression and had the lowest peer-relationship scores overall.    The youngest age group also had the most severely affected children. In particular, 30 percent of those between ages 8 and 10 had severe anxiety scores and 37 percent had severely low peer relationship scores. The 11-13 age group had the lowest anger scores.   “Some surgeons like to wait before doing certain reconstructive surgeries, but it’s good to know that we need to be more aware of the appearance concerns in the 8-10 age range,” said Dr. Russell Reid, director of the cleft and craniofacial services program at the University of Chicago Medical Center, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “We’ve assumed that teens were more aware of their surroundings and self-perception, but we need to be sensitive to issues that affect our elementary-age patients and their daily living,” Reid said in a telephone interview.    Lee and colleagues are working on several follow-up studies regarding psychosocial stress in children with facial birth defects and finding that parents believe high school is a more fragile time than elementary school.    The research team is also working with children and parents who speak Spanish in the Los Angeles area.   “For some reason, those children are doing worse,” Lee said. “We’re not sure if it’s the general immigrant experience or a particular effect of craniofacial anomalies.”   Reid said that he and colleagues plan to begin using the survey from this study to understand patients’ stress in the Chicago area, looking at the “before” and “after” effects of surgery on anxiety, depression and anger.    “We also want to follow our patients as they get older and begin to function in society,” Reid said. “Not only peer outcomes but how they feel as they integrate into society, jobs and their careers.”   Craniofacial surgery often means more to the patient than a physical change, he added. “It’s not only about fixing a structure; it’s about taking care of the whole child.”   Similarly, parents should remain aware of how their children perceive themselves and feel about their social status, Lee added.   “Kids go through a lot of things growing up, and anomalies add another stress on top of that,” she said. “It’s important for everyone to celebrate and be proud of their differences, no matter what it is.”   All parents can be supportive, whether or not their children have facial anomalies, Lee said.   “Words and actions can be hurtful and have long-lasting impacts. Be careful and aware and take that additional step of consideration.”  "
2xiNbKV,2017-10-05,Car crash death rates highest in remotest rural areas," (Reuters Health) - Car crash death rates get increasingly high as population density drops, fueled in part by lower seat belt use in the remotest rural areas, a U.S. study suggests.    “We already knew that death rates were higher and seat belt use was lower in rural versus urban areas,” said lead study author Laurie Beck, of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.    “This study expanded those findings to show that, even within rural areas, there are differences in passenger-vehicle occupant death rates and seat belt use,” Beck said by email.    Car crashes are a leading cause of death nationwide, CDC researchers note in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. While collisions are more common on urban roads, fatalities occur more often in rural regions.   For the study, CDC researchers examined data based on six categories of population density from the most metropolitan, with at least 1 million city residents, to the most rural, with fewer than 2,500 residents living in urban communities.     Passenger vehicles included cars, light trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles. Crash deaths focused on adults 18 or older, and excluded younger passengers.    Even within the primarily urban Northeast, crash death rates ranged from 3.5 fatalities for every 100,000 people in the most urban counties to 10.8 deaths for every 100,000 people in counties with fewer than 20,000 residents in metropolitan areas.    In the South, where more people live outside big cities, crash death rates ranged from 6.8 fatalities for every 100,000 people in the most urban areas to 29.2 deaths for every 100,000 people in the least urban areas, with less than 2,500 residents in urban communities.    Seat belt use ranged from about 89 percent in the most urban counties to slightly less than 75 percent in the most urban counties.    Researchers also looked at how crash death rates changed based on whether states had so-called primary seat belt laws - which allow traffic stops just for failure to wear seat belts - or what’s known as secondary seat belt laws, which permit tickets only in conjunction with other violations.   Even in Northeast states with primary seat belt laws, crash death rates were lower in cities and highest in rural communities.    Among all states with primary seat belt laws nationwide, overall crash death rates were lowest in the Northeast at 3.9 fatalities for every 100,000 people and highest in the South with 10.9 deaths for every 100,000 people.    One limitation of the study is that researchers calculated crash-death rates based on where the victim lived, not where the collision occurred, the authors note. This might have underestimated the difference in fatalities between urban and rural areas because drivers who travel across different regions are more likely to head from small towns to big cities, the authors point out.    Still, lower seat belt use in rural areas clearly contributes to higher death rates, said Dr. Jacob Sunshine, a researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Other potential contributing factors include higher speeds that are readily achieved in rural areas compared to urban areas; increased per-capita levels of impaired driving; and less proximity to designated trauma centers following traumatic injuries sustained in a motor vehicle crash,” Sunshine said by email.    Lower wages and higher unemployment in some rural communities might also mean more people are driving older cars with fewer safety features to prevent fatalities in a crash, Sunshine added.    But the study also shows that stricter seat belt laws can make a difference, especially with more stringent enforcement, he said.    “Seat belts are proven to save lives and we should educate drivers and passengers about their benefits,” Sunshine said. “Laws are important too; enforcement needs to be a priority, particularly in rural areas.”  "
2fTq8yF,2017-10-05,Industry messages on responsible drinking can be muddy," (Reuters Health) - The language used in industry-sponsored messages about drinking alcohol, such as “drink responsibly” and “drink properly,” doesn’t do a good job of explaining to the public what safe alcohol consumption means, suggests a recent study.                    FILE PHOTO: Beer bottles from all over the world are on display at the Hop museum in Wolnzach on April 10, 2014. REUTERS/Michael Dalder       “We are increasingly aware of the harms associated with alcohol consumption, and we need to communicate what the harms are and how to reduce them,” said lead author Sandra Jones of Australian Catholic University in Melbourne.    “As the evidence of harm increases, the alcohol industry is trying the tobacco industry strategy of confusing people with messages while appearing to be doing the right thing,” she told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.   Alcohol consumption is linked with alcohol use disorders, liver cirrhosis, cancer, suicide, violence, heart disease and fetal alcohol syndrome, as well as socioeconomic consequences such as unemployment, loss of income and barriers to healthcare, Jones’ team writes in PLoS One.   The Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council recommends having no more than two drinks per day and no more than four drinks in one session to reduce the risk of alcohol-related injuries and diseases.    “Responsible drinking” campaigns emerged in the early 1970s as a way to address risky drinking and consequences, and they were largely sponsored by public health agencies and organizations, the study team writes.    More recently, industry-sponsored messages have emerged. For example, DrinkWise, a public relations organization in Australia funded by the alcohol industry, recently promoted a “How to Drink Properly” campaign, which featured a handsome character similar to James Bond or Don Draper who told young adults how to drink. Public health experts criticized the campaign for glamorizing alcohol as sophisticated and stylish and for being unclear about “how much is too much.”   To gauge how the public perceives and understands such messages, the research team surveyed 180 people at malls in Melbourne and Newcastle and showed them six taglines: “Drink smart,” “Know when to say when,” “You won’t miss a moment if you DrinkWise,” “Drinking: Do it properly,” “Kids absorb your drinking,” and “Kids and alcohol don’t mix.” The researchers asked each participant what the statements conveyed and what particular words like “properly” and “kids” meant to them.   People gave a variety of responses with a wide range of meanings, most often associating the taglines with moderation, knowing limits and avoiding drunkenness. “How to drink properly,” however, confused 24 percent of participants who thought it meant “looking cool when you drink.” Another 21 percent thought it meant “drinking the right kind of alcohol,” and 8 percent thought it meant to drink more rather than less.   “What surprised us is that people mostly understood the messages - such as knowing your limit - but the message is subjective,” Jones said. “Once you’ve had a few drinks, you’re not the best judge.”   In addition, the taglines targeting parents about “kids” were vague regarding age. The legal drinking age in Australia is 18, yet only half of those surveyed thought the messages included 16- and 17-year-olds. More than 80 percent said it included 13- to 15-year-olds, and 75 percent said it included 7- to 12-year-olds.   The research team also surveyed 480 adults online after showing them four video ads with results that were similar to the first experiment. Most people interpreted the messages to be about moderation and knowing limits, other than the “How to drink properly” ad, which again was perceived by some as being about sophistication and drinking more rather than less. Participants also said that ad was least likely to change their drinking behavior.    “The key thing that stuck out was just how confused people are about what’s appropriate and proper,” said Peter Miller of Deakin University in Geelong, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the study.    Future research should investigate which messages work and then encourage the government to produce clear campaigns in addition to the vague ones being produced by the alcohol industry, said Miller, who studies alcohol messaging, policy and violence.   “People have to be critical about sources of information and where messages are coming from,” he told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “When we see the industry say, ‘drink properly,’ they’re still saying ‘drink.’”  "
2xRHlPZ,2017-10-04,Older adults more likely to disclose suicidal thoughts as they age," (Reuters Health) - More than one in five older adults who commit suicide disclose their intention to kill themselves before taking their own lives, a U.S. study suggests.    Overall, 23 percent of suicide victims age 50 or older shared suicidal thoughts with another person in the month before their death, the study found. Disclosure rates were higher among the elderly, and more common when people had chronic health problems or suffered from depression.   Many older adults who commit suicide without sharing their intentions in advance may have been reluctant to discuss these feelings because they were afraid how doctors or family members might react, said lead study author Namkee Choi, of the University of Texas at Austin Steve Hicks School of Social Work.   “Some older adults at risk of suicide may not want to disclose their suicide intent if they think family members and healthcare and social service providers may force them into inpatient treatment or dismiss their disclosure,” Choi said by email.    “Healthcare providers, especially primary care physicians who frequently see older adults with health problems and depression, should routinely assess suicide risk along with access to guns and other means of suicide,” Choi added.    For the study, Choi and colleagues examined data on 46,857 suicide deaths among adults 50 or older in U.S. states participating in a national reporting system from 2005 through 2014.    Overall, 10,971 people in the study had disclosed an explicit intent to take their own lives, shared an indirect interest in doing something to end their pain and suffering, or attempted suicide at least once in the month before they died by suicide.    This didn’t include people who shared their plans to kill themselves right before they did it, because this didn’t provide time to intervene to stop the suicide, researchers note in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.    People who did share their intentions before committing suicide were more likely to be older, white, married and military veterans, the study found.    Individuals who disclosed suicidal thoughts were also more likely to have depression and to have chronic health problems, the study also found.    Most often, people who shared suicidal thoughts told an intimate partner or other family member, and not a health professional.    People were less likely to share their intentions to commit suicide when they planned to use a gun or try to hang or suffocate themselves than when they were considering other methods, the study also found.    One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data to distinguish between verbal disclosure of suicidal thoughts and unsuccessful suicide attempts, the authors note.    Even so, the findings highlight a need for health care providers to discuss suicide with older adults in a way that’s sensitive and encourages conversation, said Dr. Linda Ganzini, a psychiatry researcher at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland who wasn’t involved in the study.   “One myth is the idea that there are ‘talkers’ and ‘doers,’ that is if people talk about suicide, they are less likely to attempt suicide,” Ganzini said by email.    “The opposite is true,” Ganzini said. “One of the most important warning signs for suicide attempts is talking about wanting to die. Families should take talk of wanting to die seriously and take steps to obtain mental health treatment.”   The Suicide Prevention Resource Center ( www.sprc.org/states ) offers free online training in suicide prevention and links to local resources where families may go for help, said Anthony Fulginiti, a social work researcher at the University of Denver who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Being able to articulate one’s pain is hard to do,” Fulginiti said by email. “Being able to react in a way that doesn’t make a person feel alienated is hard to do. So we have to practice if are going to get better at it. This is likely to help shape spaces where more disclosures happen.”  "
2wQ1IZ8,2017-10-04,Gun injuries cost U.S. $46 billion a year in lost work and medical care," (Reuters Health) - As Americans mourn the 59 people killed in Las Vegas on Sunday, a new study spotlights gunshot victims who survive.   “A startling number” of people, 78,000 a year, are treated in U.S. hospitals for firearm injuries, said lead author Dr. Faiz Gani in a phone interview.   The new report in Health Affairs calculates the price tag for firearm injuries: $2.8 billion a year in American hospital charges and $46 billion a year in lost work and medical care.   “There’s a large clinical and financial burden here, and we really need to do something about it,” said Gani, a postdoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.    Scientific, research-driven public policy might prevent shooting massacres like this week’s at a Las Vegas country music festival, he said.   Government-funded research has led to lifesaving interventions to prevent other injuries. It inspired laws mandating automobile seat belts and air bags, for example. But Congress has essentially choked off federal funding for scientific studies of firearms-injury prevention since 1996.    “Horrific mass killings receive the most media attention, but as can be seen by the numbers, they only represent a small portion of the total costs - human and medical - of gun injuries in the United States,” said David Hemenway, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center in Boston, who was not involved with the study.   Gani and colleagues analyzed a nationally representative sample of patients who arrived alive in U.S. hospital emergency departments with firearm-related injuries from 2006 through 2014.   More than 700,000 people sought care in emergency rooms for gunshot wounds during the nine years, they estimated.   Males were nine times more likely than females to be victims of gunshot injuries, and men ages 20 to 24 were at the highest risk, the study found.    The study did not collect information about race/ethnicity.   Unintentional shootings led to more than one-third of the non-fatal firearm injuries, the authors found.    “Unintentional shootings are often presented as a minor problem - they are not,” Hemenway said by email.   The new study reveals gaping holes in our understanding of gunshot injuries. Researchers could not determine, for example, what kind of weapon was used in nearly two-thirds of the cases because the information was unrecorded.   In 1996, researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that people who kept guns in their homes faced a nearly three-fold greater risk of homicide and a nearly five-fold greater risk of suicide. In response, Jay Dickey, an Arkansas Republican who described himself as the National Rifle Association’s “point person in Congress,” submitted an amendment to strip the CDC budget of $2.6 million, the amount it spent on firearms research the previous year.    The so-called Dickey Amendment has since then almost entirely stopped federal funding of firearms research.    Before he died this year, Dickey had a change of heart. In 2012, he and Mark Rosenberg, who directed the CDC when the Dickey Amendment was approved, co-authored a Washington Post editorial calling for scientific research to prevent firearm injuries. ( wapo.st/2fRfuII )    “We were on opposite sides of the heated battle 16 years ago, but we are in strong agreement now that scientific research should be conducted into preventing firearm injuries and that ways to prevent firearm deaths can be found without encroaching on the rights of legitimate gun owners,” they wrote.

2fNg3mP,2017-10-03,"Meditation may help prevent heart disease, doctors say"," (Reuters Health) - Meditation may help reduce the risk of heart disease when it’s added to proven approaches like lifestyle changes or drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, U.S. doctors say.    In its first guidelines dedicated to meditation, the American Heart Association (AHA) stresses that the benefits haven’t been clearly established because studies have generally been too small, brief or poorly designed to draw broad conclusions. But the AHA research review concludes that meditation may have some benefits beyond just reducing stress, said Dr. Glenn Levine, chair of the AHA task force on clinical practice guidelines.    “Meditation can be considered as an adjunctive lifestyle intervention in those interested in this practice,” Levine, a researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said by email. “We do not believe meditation should be undertaken as a substitute for well-established and recommended lifestyle and medicinal interventions.”   The practice of meditation dates back as far as 5000 BC. While meditation is associated with certain philosophies and religions, today it’s practiced by people from many walks of life as a way to improve focus and relaxation, Levine and colleagues note in the Journal of the American Heart Association.    The guidelines don’t address mind-body practices such as yoga and Tai Chi because the physical activity in these pursuits has been proven to help lower the risk of heart disease.    Instead, the AHA focused on sitting meditation, including a variety of common forms such as: Samatha; Vipassana (Insight Meditation); Mindful Meditation; Zen Meditation (Zazen); Raja Yoga; Loving-Kindness (Metta); Transcendental Meditation; and Relaxation Response.   Among other things, these inactive forms of meditation may be associated with decreased levels of stress, anxiety and depression, and improved sleep and overall wellbeing, the AHA guidelines note.    Meditation might also help lower blood pressure, but there isn’t enough evidence yet to show whether or how much blood pressure might decline for individuals.    Some studies have also suggested that meditation might help people quit smoking, the guidelines conclude.    Meditation may help lower the risk of heart disease by countering the impact of stress on the body, said Dr. James Stahl, a researcher at the Geisel Medical School at Dartmouth College and at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire.   When people are under stress, their fight or flight response can kick in, leading to a release of stress hormones as well as spikes in blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen consumption and a release of inflammatory chemicals in the body, Stahl, who wasn’t involved in the guidelines, said by email.   “This is perfectly appropriate when confronted by a tiger but not so much if ordinary things like traffic trigger this response,” Stahl said.    Meditation can trigger the opposite of a fight or flight response, encouraging the body to slow down and improving risk factors for heart disease like metabolic problems or inflammation.    Some patients may even be able to try meditation along with diet and lifestyle changes before they move on to drugs, Stahl said. Meditation will work best, however, if people practice with the help of a trained professional.    With regular practice, meditation may also help improve quality of life, especially emotional and spiritual aspects, said Bei-Hung Chang, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester who wasn’t involved in the guidelines.   “Meditation generally has low risks, and low costs,” Chang said by email. “Once learned, the technique can be practiced anytime and in any place, and integrated into one’s way of life.”  "
2fP36ZE,2017-10-03,"Plastic surgery videos need strict ethics standards, doctors argue"," (Reuters Health) - Some plastic surgeons have gained large social media followings by sharing theatrical videos of surgery with entertainment, rather than education, in mind. Now experts are proposing ethics guidelines to ensure that the content of plastic surgery videos on social media isn’t harmful to patients.   Too often, plastic surgery videos cross an ethical line, exploiting patients and luring future customers with flashy before-and-after images that gloss over the dangers of surgery, doctors argue in the proposed ethics guidelines published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.    To refocus videos on education and prevent exploitation, the guidelines stress that patients should be asked to consent to filming in advance and be allowed to refuse the request. Because online videos might be manipulated and widely shared, patients should also understand that their image might be used for something their doctor didn’t sanction and that content is difficult to remove online once it’s posted.    “Plastic surgery is uniquely drawn to social media because we tend to do more marketing and we are a visual specialty,” said Dr. Clark Schierle, senior author of the guidelines and a plastic surgeon at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.    “In general, there should be an effort to avoid distractions from the actual surgery itself and sharing any content that makes the patient identifiable without specific consent,” Schierle said by email.    Many plastic surgeons question the ethics of broadcasts done more for entertainment and marketing than for education, the authors said, and have called for the development of more structured oversight and guidance in this area.   The guidelines - the first to address sharing videos of plastic surgery on social media - will be presented October 6 at the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) annual meeting in Orlando.   “We hope this will make its way into the official ethical code of conduct for board-certified plastic surgeons,” Schierle said.    Plastic surgeons, like others in the medical profession, should adhere to ethical standards that prioritize decisions that will not harm patients, the guidelines argue.    Even when patients agree to be filmed and have videos shared online, doctors still have an obligation to protect patients’ privacy and portray them in a respectful manner, the guidelines stress.    Any marks or identifying features on patients should be obscured in videos so that patients can’t be easily discovered online. Patients faces shouldn’t be shown unless the explicitly consent to this and are told this will allow viewers to identify them and name them in any social media posts using the video.    “Video shared may impact the patient socially or professionally in the future,” Schierle said.    Patients also shouldn’t feel pressured to allow videos, and they should know their medical care won’t be influenced by whether or not they consent. When patients do permit filming, surgeons should make sure it doesn’t interfere with the procedures, and they should have another person do the filming so they can concentrate on the patient.    “The public has a right to see uncensored video from the operating room if they are interested, and we are all for the dissemination of good-quality information,” Schierle added. “Where we have concerns is in video that is of a more entertaining or self-serving nature at the expense of the patient.”  "
2xcoxvn,2017-10-02,Few U.S. hospitals can fully share electronic medical records," (Reuters Health) - Less than one in three U.S. hospitals can find, send, and receive electronic medical records for patients who receive care somewhere else, a new study suggests.    Just 30 percent of hospitals had achieved so-called interoperability as of 2015, the study found. While that’s slight improvement over the previous year, when 25 percent met this goal, it shows hospitals still have a long way to go, researchers report in Health Affairs.    “What this means is there is potentially a significant amount of waste and inefficiency in hospitals,” said lead study author Jay Holmgren of Harvard Business School in Boston.    Without access to patient records, doctors might re-order tests that have already been done somewhere else, or make treatment decisions without a full picture of any allergies or underlying medical conditions.    “And, without a system for getting electronic patient data to clinicians, the responsibility falls on patients and their families, who often resort to bringing printouts of records from one hospital to another,” Holmgren said by email. “It just adds to the burden of being sick.”   For the study, researchers examined survey data from hospitals that belong to the American Hospital Association (AHA).    The study found that hospitals across the country have focused primarily on moving electronic health records from one institution to another, rather than on integrating relevant subsets of information - for example, clinical notes, lab tests and other patient information - in ways that would allow clinicians to easily learn what they need to know without having to read through a patient’s entire record.   While 43 percent of hospitals reported that outside patient information was available electronically when necessary in 2015, more than one-third reported that they rarely or never used it.    The most common barrier these hospitals reported to using outside information was that their clinicians could not see it embedded into their own system’s electronic health record.   Just 19 percent of hospitals said they often used data from outside providers.    “Sharing electronic information between hospitals has been poor for many years,” said Dean Sittig, a biomedical informatics researcher at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston who wasn’t involved in the study.    “At first, we blamed it on lack of data in electronic form, and now that the vast majority of hospitals have electronic health records and therefore the data is in electronic form, we need another excuse,” Sittig said by email.    “The findings in this article say that for the most part, hospitals are still not sharing data and even fewer are actually integrating that shared information into their electronic health records,” Sittig added.    To compensate, patients often obtain copies of records that they deliver in person to an outside provider or request that they be sent, said Ann Kutney-Lee, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing in Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study.    Patients also have some options to manage their own records electronically.    “Patients can create their own online Personal Health Record (PHR) where they can store, manage, and share health information all in a single location - although all of the data would initially need to be collected by the patient and then manually uploaded,” Kutney-Lee said by email. “Most of these websites are free and are accessible by computer or smartphone.”   Increasing numbers of health care providers and hospitals are also offering patients access to online portals that contain all lab work, health histories, and test results performed by that provider, hospital, or healthcare system.    “Although many of these portals do not yet link with outside providers, patients could enter this information into a personal health record themselves,” Kutney-Lee said.  "
2fEGiZq,2017-10-02,"Exercise prevents elderly mobility problems, and the more the better"," (Reuters Health) - Less than an extra hour a week of moderate exercise can make a big difference in helping older adults stay mobile and reduce their risk of developing major mobility problems, a U.S. study suggests.   Improvements were seen in all the 70-to-90-year-olds who added some physical activity to their weekly routines over about two years, and those who got more exercise saw greater changes, researchers report in the journal PLoS ONE.   Exercise prevents or improves conditions such as hip fractures, heart disease and diabetes that often underlie mobility disability, said lead author Roger Fielding of Tufts University in Boston. But “it was not known if exercise could prevent the onset of physical disability in older adults who might be at risk for becoming disabled and if the amount of exercise that was performed influenced this response,” he told Reuters Health in an email.   His team found “a graded dose response,” with the greatest benefit “in the group of people who on average increased their exercise approximately 50 minutes per week over two years,” said Fielding.    The researchers studied 1,635 men and women who enrolled in The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study in 2010 and 2011, between ages 70 and 89.    At the start, participants were inactive, with less than 20 minutes of regular physical activity per week.   Half were randomly assigned to a program of walking and walking-based strength, flexibility and balance training. The others were assigned to twice-monthly health education workshops. The study team used movement monitors and self-reporting to measure weekly physical activity in both groups at the start of the study and after 24 months.    After an average of 2.6 years, researchers assessed participants for development of a major mobility disability, which they defined as loss of the ability to walk 400 meters (437 yards) within 15 minutes without sitting, and without a walker or assistance from another person.   In a previous study, the team found that being physically active lowered the risk of any persistent mobility disability by 28 percent, and the risk of major mobility disability by 18 percent.   In the current analysis, they found that more activity is better but even a little helps. Dividing the exercise group into four subgroups based on weekly activity level, researchers found that those with the most activity were 77 percent less likely than those with the least activity to develop major mobility disability.    There was a continuous, graded effect, with the most benefits seen by participants who engaged in at least 48 minutes of physical activity per week.   Moderate intensity exercise is generally safe for most people, Fielding said. “Walking was part of our intervention and almost all older people, even those with mobility problems, can begin a walking program.”   He recommends starting slowly, with about five minutes per session and building up over time. “Try to walk most days of the week but at least five,” he said, adding that people should inform their physician that they are starting to exercise but don’t necessarily need to wait for their physician’s okay.   “Older people worried about their mobility should talk to their physician for advice and request an evaluation by a physical therapist, who can help them target areas to strengthen,” said Dorothy Dunlop, a researcher at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study.   Enjoyable programs, such as Walk with Ease and Enhanced Fitness, are designed for adults with mobility problems and are widely available through the YMCA and the Arthritis Foundation, she said.   Weight control is also an important key to preventing mobility problems, Dunlop added.   “Statistics tell us almost 2 out of 3 adults with obesity will develop knee osteoarthritis, a condition which interferes with mobility,” she said by email. “Overweight people who lose weight will not only find it easier to be active, this will help them avoid developing serious conditions like heart disease and diabetes.”  "
2xM4r9S,2017-09-29,Home blood pressure monitoring works best with extra support," (Reuters Health) - People who monitor their own blood pressure at home may get better results if they also have extra support like counseling and lifestyle coaching, a research review suggests.    To see how blood pressure control is influenced by patients checking it themselves at home, researchers examined data from 25 previously published studies that randomly assigned a total of more than 10,000 people to either monitor themselves regularly or just stick with usual care including periodic checkups at the doctor.    Overall, for people who didn’t get extra support to go along with their home testing, there wasn’t much difference between self-monitoring and sticking with blood pressure checks only at the doctor’s office, the study found.    But when home monitoring was paired with extra support or medication adjustments managed by patients based on test results, people achieved significantly lower blood pressure compared to usual care.   “If self-monitoring is combined with ongoing tailored interaction with the patient, then this can enable important improvements in blood pressure control, over and above self-monitoring on its own,” said lead study author Dr. Katherine Tucker of the University of Oxford in the UK.   “Our research shows that increased collaboration between a patient and either their general practitioner, a nurse or a pharmacist in the treatment of hypertension can result in important decreases in blood pressure and improved control necessary to improve a patient’s health,” Tucker said by email.    Home blood pressure monitoring is currently recommended for many patients because it can help get more accurate readings than are obtained at the doctor’s office, and it can also assist clinicians in adjusting medication between checkups.    While some research suggests home monitoring can help achieve better results than testing only in the exam room, it’s not yet clear who benefits most from this approach or how to make it most effective, researchers note in PLoS Medicine.    In adults, a blood pressure reading of 120/80 mmHg (millimeters of mercury) or lower is considered normal or healthy. Pressure readings that are consistently 140/90 mmHg or greater are considered high blood pressure.   When researchers looked at the “top number” known as systolic blood pressure (the pressure blood exerts against artery walls when the heart beats), they found home blood pressure checks were associated with average reductions that were 3.2 mmHg larger than with usual care over 12 months.    When self-monitoring wasn’t paired with any additional support, however, it was only linked to an extra 1-mmHg drop in blood pressure compared to usual care – a difference too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    With plenty of extra help tailored to patients’ individual needs, self-monitoring was associated with a blood pressure reduction 6.1 mmHg larger than with usual care, the study found.    One limitation of the analysis is that the smaller studies included had different methods and varying criteria for selecting participants, which made it difficult to draw broad conclusions from examining the combined results, the authors note.    Still, the findings suggest that self-monitoring can play an important role in helping patients get blood pressure under control, said Dr. Costantino Iadecola, director of the Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.    For one thing, home testing can help spot variation in blood pressure between checkups, Iadecola, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. Readings outside an exam room may also be more accurate for some people who get what’s known as “white coat hypertension,” or stress-related blood pressure spikes during checkups, Iadecola added.    Even though a 3-mmHg reduction in blood pressure might not seem that large, if it’s sustained over time for a broad population of people it can translate into a significant decrease in heart disease and deaths, said Dr. Ian Kronish, a researcher at Columbia University Medical Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Taking action at the time of elevated readings provides opportunities for teachable moments in which education and counseling may be more likely to lead to behavior change on the part of the patients,” Kronish said by email. “Similarly, with self-monitoring, clinicians may have more opportunities to take action to get patients’ blood pressure to goal through increased medication.”  "
2fTqK47,2017-09-29,One episode of postpartum depression raises likelihood of more," (Reuters Health) - Depression after giving birth is rare among women with no history of psychiatric disorders, but once “postpartum depression” occurs, the odds are much higher that it will happen again after subsequent births, researchers say.   Among more than 450,000 first-time mothers in Denmark with no prior bouts of depression, less than 1 percent had postpartum depression after giving birth. But those who did were 27 to 46 times more likely to experience it again after later births, researchers found.    Overall, about 5 percent to 15 percent of all mothers are diagnosed with depression after giving birth, the study team notes in PLoS Medicine. A history of psychiatric disorders before giving birth increases the risk of postpartum depression significantly.   “The risk of postpartum affective disorder (AD) among women with no previous psychiatric disease is low,” lead study author Marie-Louise Rasmussen told Reuters Health in an email.   But for women who do develop postpartum depression, “the risk of a later affective disorder is increased and the risk of a recurrent postpartum affective disorder episode is relatively high,” said Rasmussen, a researcher with Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen.   The researchers analyzed data on 457,317 Danish women who had their first babies between 1996 and 2013 and had no history of hospital visits for psychiatric problems or use of antidepressants. During the study, the women had a total of 789,068 births.   Just 0.6 percent of the births were associated with treatment for postpartum depression. The treatment was relatively short in most cases.    Compared to women who didn’t have postpartum depression after their first childbirth, those who did and were treated with antidepressants were 27 times more likely to have postpartum depression after giving birth again. Women hospitalized for a first episode of postpartum depression were 46 times more likely to experience postpartum depression after a subsequent birth.   The findings underline the seriousness of first-time postpartum depression and the need for both primary and secondary preventive measures, Rasmussen said.   “As for all women contemplating to have more children, social support from the spouse and surroundings is very important - probably even more so for women with a previous history of postpartum AD,” she said.   In some women, preventive medication or psychotherapy might be relevant, Rasmussen added.   The report is both reassuring and concerning, said Dr. Jonathan Alpert, chair of the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences department at Montefiore Health System in New York, who was not part of the study.    “It is reassuring in finding that for fewer than 1 in 100 women does postpartum depression serious enough to require antidepressant medications and/or hospital admission represent their first psychiatric episode.” It’s also reassuring that the risks are relatively low for women without a prior psychiatric history, he said.   “On the other hand, the report also underscores the importance of postpartum depression as a predictor of future episodes of mood disorder symptoms or postpartum depression.”    Any woman with a psychiatric history should be monitored closely for postpartum depression and any woman with postpartum depression after a first childbirth should be followed closely in later years for risk of depression in general and of postpartum depression after following pregnancies in particular, Alpert said.   “Although postpartum blues or transient moodiness and tearfulness after delivery are common occurrences, persistent depressed mood, severe mood swings, or distorted thinking are signs of needing help right away,” he said.   Women should contact their obstetrician right away for an evaluation and possible treatment such as antidepressants or psychotherapy Alpert said. “Any woman who has thoughts of harming herself or her baby should seek emergency help immediately.”   Reliable sources of online information about postpartum depression and related topics such as risks of antidepressants during pregnancy include postpartum.net, sponsored by Postpartum Support International, and womensmentalhealth.org, sponsored by the MGH Center for Women’s Mental Health, Alpert said.

2wlfeoq,2017-09-29,"Stopping aspirin therapy may raise heart attack, stroke risk"," (Reuters Health) - Stopping low-dose aspirin therapy without good reason raises the likelihood of heart attack or stroke by nearly 40 percent, a large Swedish study suggests.   Doctors commonly prescribe daily low-dose aspirin after a heart attack to reduce the risk of having a second cardiovascular event. But about one in six patients stop taking their aspirin within three years, the study authors note in Circulation.   “(Low-dose aspirin) makes the platelets in the blood less likely to form blood clots, and this is especially useful in the coronary or carotid arteries, where blood clots may lead to myocardial infarctions and strokes,” lead author Dr. Johan Sundstrom told Reuters Health by email.   “Millions of patients worldwide take aspirin on a daily basis and might consider stopping at some time during their life. We performed this study to help physicians and patients to make an informed decision whether or not to stop aspirin use,” said Sundstrom, an epidemiologist at Uppsala University.   To see if risk rises after a patient stops aspirin therapy, Sundstrom’s team used nationwide medical and death registries to identify patients over age 40 taking low-dose aspirin. In Sweden, low-dose aspirin is available only by prescription, so the researchers were also able to see who continued filling their prescriptions between 2005 and 2009.    The researchers analyzed records for 601,527 patients who were cancer-free and had taken at least 80 percent of their prescribed aspirin doses during the first year of treatment. After excluding a small proportion of patients whose medical records showed a reason for stopping aspirin, such as surgery or a case of severe bleeding, they found that about 15 percent of the full group had stopped taking their aspirin after about three years.   At the end of the study period, there were a total of 62,690 cardiovascular events, defined as hospitalization for a heart attack or stroke, or cardiovascular death.   “Patients who discontinued aspirin had a 37 percent higher rate of cardiovascular events than those who continued,” Sundstrom said. That translates to one extra cardiovascular event each year among every 74 patients who stopped taking aspirin.    The risk increased shortly after discontinuation, and did not appear to diminish over time, he added. “Hence, adherence to low-dose aspirin treatment in the absence of major surgery or bleeding is likely an important treatment goal.”    The study wasn’t a controlled trial designed to prove that stopping aspirin causes cardiovascular events. The researchers also didn’t have access to information on other factors that could influence risk, such as socioeconomic status, physical examination findings, blood work or smoking status.   “I think this gives clinicians more data to share with their patients, however, it likely won’t change current practice patterns for most providers because most already recommend low-dose aspirin for their cardiovascular patients,” said Dr. Abha Khandelwal, a cardiologist at Stanford University Medical Center in California who wasn’t involved in the study.   The bigger issue is how to address the high discontinuation rate noted in this study and learning how to overcome that will be very valuable, she said in an email.   Khandelwal noted that there are several established reports demonstrating lack of patient adherence to medications especially as they get older, and their medication list grows longer.    “There are many reasons that can contribute to this, from cost of medications, side effects, to confusion with a number of pills to name a few,” she said.   At the Women’s Heart Health clinic at Stanford, adherence is good, she noted. “This is partly due to the multidisciplinary approach including internists, cardiologists, nurses, advanced care providers, and behavioral psychologist who spend a considerable amount of time on education, and identifying barriers to medication adherence so we can work together with our motivated patient population on overcoming them.”   Despite aspirin being an over-the-counter medication in the U.S., it may have some side effects that one must weigh when prescribing, such as damaging the lining of the stomach and increasing the risk of bleeding, Khandelwal said.   “Therefore, patients need to continue a dialogue with their doctor over time to determine whether they should continue on therapy. This should especially be done prior to major surgery if they have had an episode of severe bleeding that led to a hospitalization or resulted in blood transfusions.”  "
2fAzyPm,2017-09-28,Psoriasis patients face increased risk of heart attacks and death," (Reuters Health) - People with psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory disease, may be more likely than others to experience heart attacks and strokes at least in part because inflammation damages their vascular system, a recent study suggests.    The longer people had lived with psoriasis, the more inflammation they had in their blood vessels, the analysis of imaging tests for 190 psoriasis patients found.    While these imaging tests didn’t connect vascular inflammation to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, researchers also examined data on roughly 87,000 Danish adults with psoriasis and another 4.2 million people without the condition. They found each year people lived with psoriasis was associated with a 1 percent increase in the future risk of cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes.    “It has been suspected that long-term exposure to low-grade systemic inflammation may increase the risk of cardiovascular events, but the effect of disease duration on the relationship between psoriasis and cardiovascular disease has been unclear,” said lead study author Dr. Alexander Egeberg of Gentofte Hospital in Copenhagen.    The inflammation in psoriasis is very similar to, and in many cases can overlap with, the inflammatory processes that contribute to hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis, Egeberg said.    Even though plenty of previous research has linked psoriasis to heart disease, the current results offer fresh evidence that living longer with systemic inflammation can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes even for psoriasis patients who don’t have other risk factors for heart disease such as smoking, diabetes or advanced age, Egeberg added.    All of the patients in the imaging portion of the study had mild to moderate psoriasis.    On average, they were around 54 years old and had been living with psoriasis for roughly eight years.    The duration of psoriasis was associated with increased vascular inflammation even after accounting for traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as smoking and a family history of heart attack or stroke.    In the separate analysis of the Danish population, researchers followed people for an average of almost five years.   During this period, 152,122 people without psoriasis had major events like a heart attack or stroke, which translates into about 8 people out of every 1,000 in the population each year.   Over that same time, 4,472 people with psoriasis had major events like a heart attack or stroke, which translates into about 11 people out of every 1,000 in the population each year.    One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data for the Danish population on other factors that influence cardiovascular health such as obesity and exercise habits, the authors note in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.    Even so, patients should be aware that psoriasis can make cardiovascular problems more likely, said Dr. Lawrence Eichenfield of Rady Children’s Hospital and the University of California, San Diego.    “There is some evidence that certain systemic medications that treat psoriasis potentially decrease the inflammation and can decrease the psoriasis-associated cardiovascular risks,” Eichenfield, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “The psoriasis treatment options should be discussed with a dermatologist.”  "
2hyxkAJ,2017-09-28,Saving carbs for last may help ward off blood sugar spike for diabetics," (Reuters Health) - Saving the bread for last at mealtime could help people with diabetes keep their blood sugar under control, new research suggests.   People with type 2 diabetes who ate protein and vegetables before they consumed carbohydrate-heavy bread and orange juice had a significantly lower increase in blood sugar after the meal, compared to when they ate carbs first, Dr. Alpana Shukla and Dr. Louis Aronne of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City found.   The decrease “is comparable to the kind of effect you see with some of the drugs we use to treat diabetes,” Shukla told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “Eating carbohydrates last may be a simple strategy for regulating post-meal glucose levels.”   Keeping blood sugar in check is crucial for people with type 2 diabetes, in part because it helps protect them from severe complications including heart disease, vision loss and nerve damage, Shukla noted. Typically, the researcher added, diabetic individuals are advised to cut down on their carb intake and stick with complex carbs rather than simple sugars.   To follow up on small studies showing that eating protein before carbs led to a smaller bump in blood sugar than vice versa, the researchers had 16 men and women with type 2 diabetes consume the exact same meal on three separate occasions, one week apart, eating the items in a different order each time.    Study participants ate bread and orange juice first, took a 10-minute rest, and finished up with chicken and salad; ate the meal in the reverse order; and consumed the chicken, veggies and bread as a sandwich, accompanied by orange juice. Every time, participants consumed the same amount of calories and carbohydrate.   When people ate the carbs last, their post-meal blood glucose levels were about half as high as when they ate carbs first, and about 40 percent lower than when they ate all meal components together. The carbohydrate-last meal was also associated with lower insulin secretion and higher levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a gut hormone that helps regulate glucose and satiety. Insulin levels required to keep study participants’ glucose under control were about 25 percent lower when they followed the carbs-last plan.   “We all recognize that while it’s good to eat less carbs to control blood sugar levels, it may sometimes be difficult to follow this advice,” Shukla said. The new findings offer people a simple strategy for preventing glucose spikes when consuming carbs, she added.   “In the real world, when people actually eat carbohydrates at the end of the meal after consuming vegetables and protein, they will probably end up consuming somewhat less,” the researcher noted. The lower insulin requirements and increase in GLP-1 the study team observed suggests that closing a meal with carbs may also be helpful for weight management, Shukla added, although more research is needed.   Aronne and Shukla are now testing the carbs-last approach in people with so-called pre-diabetes, when blood sugar is abnormally elevated but falls short of the cutoff for diagnosing diabetes. People with elevated blood sugar are at increased risk of progressing to full-blown diabetes and the study team wants to see if the carbs-last strategy can play a role in diabetes prevention.  "
2xMWLVb,2017-09-28,YouTube videos deliver alcohol brand messaging to underage viewers," (Reuters Health) - YouTube videos that depict alcohol brands favored by youth draw millions of views, making them a form of promotion that could encourage underage drinkers, according to a U.S. study.   The videos often resemble traditional ads but may escape public health notice or parental controls, the study authors write in the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs.   “YouTube has become one of the largest video-sharing platforms but often goes under the radar in studies,” said lead author Dr. Brian Primack of the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania.   “Brands are extremely important when it comes to youth and alcohol consumption,” he told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “Sometimes the key transition occurs when a young person is more susceptible to branding.”   Primack and colleagues looked for videos with brands that are popular among underage drinkers and appear in pop culture, specifically Bud Light, Coors Light, Grey Goose, Hennessey, Jack Daniel’s, Mike’s Hard Lemonade, Patron and Smirnoff. They analyzed 137 videos published between 2006 and 2013 looking at factors like production quality, actors’ traits such as sex and race/ethnicity, as well as positive and negative associations with alcohol use.   They found that videos averaged about two minutes in length and had about 116,000 views each, totaling nearly 97 million views for all 137 videos. About 60 percent were classified as having professional production quality. Some 40 percent of videos were considered traditional advertising and other common categories were music videos or concerts, as well as “chugging” videos.    “We didn’t expect the biggest category to be traditional ads, which means this is a method that marketers are using to reach youth,” Primack said. “They’re getting a lot of bang for their buck, especially when people repost these videos online.”   The video types and messages tended to vary by brand, too. For example, 83 percent of those that featured Bud Light were traditional ads, as compared to 18 percent of the Grey Goose videos and none of the Patron videos.    Related to positive associations with alcohol use, more than 80 percent of Bud Light and Coors Light videos featured humor. Similarly, all of the Patron-related videos but none of the Bud Light-related videos portrayed intoxication. Only Grey Goose and Jack Daniel’s videos had references to addiction or dependence. Most negativity was seen in music videos, which tended to portray heavy drinking and a “gritty” lifestyle, the study found.   Most videos weren’t uploaded by the companies themselves, but rather were derived from concerts, parties and music videos sponsored by the companies or individuals who uploaded and tagged a video as “humor.”   “What online alcohol promotion has resulted in is social media users becoming unsolicited brand ambassadors for alcohol companies,” said Adam Barry of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas, who wasn’t involved in the study, in an email.    “Even if they don’t go looking for these messages, alcohol promotional materials will come right to the computer in their pocket when someone else tags, likes, or shares it, and when an update dings, they’ll view it,” said Barry, whose own research has found that youth often have easy access to alcohol promotions on YouTube, Twitter and Instagram.   YouTube added an Age Gate in 2012 to block inappropriate content from underage users, but some links are still accessible. Primack says he and colleagues aren’t suggesting that teens can be prevented from viewing these videos or that parents should solely focus on limiting exposure.    “That’s not feasible,” he said. “What would be useful is supporting more media literacy and encouraging young people to analyze what they see.”   Future studies could look at the specific messages being portrayed in the YouTube videos that play on themes such as rebelliousness, impulsivity and experiences that go against authorities such as parents and teachers, he noted.    “What we can discuss with kids is how that isn’t the reality,” Primack said. “Instead, the forces trying to manipulate them are the alcohol industry. The brands are trying to attract new drinkers.”  "
2x0HP3o,2017-09-28,Stopping antidepressants tied to increased relapse risk,"  ((The Sept. 21 story corrects “with” to “without” in second-to-last paragraph))   By Lisa Rapaport   (Reuters Health) - People taking antidepressants for anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more likely to relapse when they stop using these drugs than when they remain on medication, a research review confirms.   Researchers analyzed the combined results from 28 previously published studies with a total of 5,233 participants who had been on antidepressants for up to one year. Patients were randomly assigned to either continue medication or switch to placebo, or dummy, pills.    Over the next year, patients who discontinued treatment were roughly three times more likely to relapse than people who remained on antidepressants, researchers report in The BMJ.    “Patients and their doctors should be aware that discontinuing antidepressants within a year is associated with increased relapse risk,” said lead study author Dr. Neeltje Batelaan of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam.    “This should be taken into account when discussing discontinuation,” Batelaan said by email. “It does not imply that all patients should remain on antidepressants for the rest of their lives.”   That’s because the majority of patients who discontinue antidepressants do not relapse, and because relapse sometimes occurs even when patients are still taking these medications, Batelaan added.    Overall, relapse occurred in about 36 percent of people who switched to placebo and 16 percent of those who remained on antidepressants, the study found.    And among the patients who did relapse, this happened more than three times faster for people switched to placebo than for individuals kept on antidepressants.    It’s not exactly clear why some patients relapsed, but it’s unlikely to have been caused by withdrawal symptoms among the people who discontinued treatment, Batelaan said.   Many antidepressants work by altering the way certain chemicals in the brain such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine transmit signals involved in controlling emotions and moods. Stopping antidepressants is thought to change how these brain chemicals function, which may lead to relapse in some people.    Side effects of antidepressants can include nausea, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, insomnia, blurred vision and constipation. One limitation of the study is that it included only patients who had been taking these medications for up to a year, making it likely that all or most of the participants didn’t need to halt treatment due to side effects.    Another drawback of the study is its reliance primarily on published studies funded by drug companies, which the authors note might bias the results toward showing the benefits of continuing antidepressant treatment.   Even so, the results add to a large body of evidence already suggesting that patients on antidepressants may be more prone to relapse when they discontinue treatment than when they remain on medication, said Dr. Ronald Pies, a psychiatry researcher at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York, and Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.   “If the patient has a fairly severe or recurrent anxiety disorder that has not responded to cognitive-behavioral therapy alone, the use of an antidepressant for up to a year and possibly longer can be justified, owing to the risk of relapse without medication - so long as the patient is tolerating the treatment reasonably well,” Pies, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “Not all patients will need long-term medication,” Pies added. “In fact, the study found that most patients do well when discontinuing treatment.”  "
2fzzD5X,2017-09-27,More evidence that even a little exercise is good for your heart," (Reuters Health) - People with heart disease who are sedentary most of the time may be able to improve their survival odds by getting just a little bit of exercise, a recent study suggests.    Researchers examined data from 39 countries on 15,486 older adults with heart disease who completed questionnaires about the number of hours each week they devoted to mild, moderate and vigorous physical activities. Then researchers tracked everyone to see how many died or had serious problems like a heart attack or stroke.    More than half the participants were followed for nearly 4 years.   Overall, researchers calculated that participants who doubled their weekly activity levels could lower their odds of premature death from all causes by 10 percent and cut their chances of an early death from heart problems by 8 percent.    The most pronounced gains in survival odds would occur for people who went from getting little or no exercise to getting even small amounts of mild activity like yoga, strolling or light housework, the study found.    “Our study in a large group of patients with coronary heart disease from many countries confirms the benefits from undertaking moderate and vigorous exercise,” said lead study author Dr. Ralph Stewart of Auckland City Hospital and the University of Auckland in New Zealand.   “In addition, we found that people who did a modest amount of milder intensity physical activity also had lower mortality compared to those who reported little or no exercise,” Stewart said by email. “These benefits were also seen in people with more severe heart disease.”   For cardiovascular health, the American Heart Association recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity five days a week, or at least 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity three days a week, or a combination of the two.   Moderate activity - which causes a light sweat, or only modest increases in breathing or heart rate - includes fast walking, lawn mowing or heavy cleaning. Vigorous activity includes running or race walking, lap swimming or aerobics.   At the start of the study, all of the participants had already had a heart attack or been treated for serious health problems related to heart disease. They also had at least one other risk factor for death or serious complications related to heart disease such as diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking or age at least 60.    The study didn’t find that the amount of exercise people got was linked to their odds of having a heart attack or stroke, researchers report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.    But it did find that the relationship between increased exercise and decreased mortality was strongest for patients at the highest risk of dying because of their risk factors for death and complications from heart disease.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how exercise habits influence the odds of death for people with heart disease.    Other limitations include the reliance on participants to accurately recall and report on their exercise habits, as well as a lack of data on a variety of social, economic, cultural and societal factors that can influence physical activity levels.    However, because previous research on exercise and longevity for heart disease has often focused on supervised workout programs, the current study offers fresh evidence of the benefits of activities people do on their own, said Dr. Thijs Eijsvogels of Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, author of an accompanying editorial.    “Little volumes of physical activity resulted in large decreases of mortality risks,” Eijsvogels said by email.    “This finding is important for patients as it highlights that every minute of exercise is beneficial for your health,” Eijsvogels added. “So if you cannot achieve the national exercise recommendations of 150 minutes a week, try to perform exercise at a volume that is feasible for you.”  "
2fyHvVs,2017-09-27,Many adults with diabetes delay insulin therapy," (Reuters Health) - Three in ten adults with type 2 diabetes who need to start taking insulin to lower their blood sugar don’t begin treatment when their doctors tell them to, a recent study suggests.    On average, these patients delay insulin for about two years, researchers report in Diabetic Medicine.    “This matters to patients because insulin therapy is typically offered to patients with high blood sugar levels,” said senior study author Dr. Alexander Turchin of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.    “If the patient does not start insulin therapy and does not initiate any other changes to bring their blood sugar levels down, their blood sugar can stay high for years, leading to diabetes complications such as blindness, kidney failure and heart attacks,” Turchin said by email.    Globally, about one in 10 adults have diabetes, according to the World Health Organization. Most have type 2 diabetes, which is associated with obesity and aging and occurs when the body can’t make or process enough of the hormone insulin.   Medications as well as lifestyle changes such as improved diet and exercise habits can help manage diabetes and keep symptoms in check. When diabetes isn’t well managed, however, dangerously high blood sugar can eventually lead to blindness, amputations, kidney failure, heart disease and stroke.   While some previous research has found diabetics often fail to start insulin when it’s needed, it’s been unclear how much of this is due to doctors failing to prescribe the medication versus patients refusing to take it, Turchin said.    For the current study, researchers examined data from electronic physician notes at Brigham and Women’s Hospital from 2000 to 2014.    Of the 3,295 patients with diabetes included in the analysis, nearly one third declined a physician’s advice to begin insulin at the time the recommendation was made, researchers report in Diabetic Medicine.   People who initially declined, but ultimately accepted the recommendation to start insulin, started the insulin therapy more than two years later, on average, during which time their blood glucose levels climbed.   Sanofi, which sells insulin products, funded the study.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how delaying insulin impacts the course of diabetes or patients’ health.    Another limitation is the potential that results from one medical center might not reflect what happens for a broader population of patients, the authors note.    It’s also possible that some patients declined insulin but this wasn’t noted in their medical records, leading the study to underestimate how often this occurs. Patients’ reasons for declining or delaying insulin were unknown.    Some patients might reject insulin because they’re afraid of needles or injections, or because they mistakenly think insulin causes diabetes complications, said Dr. Simon Heller, a diabetes researcher at the University of Sheffield in the UK who wasn’t involved in the study.    “They mistakenly think that insulin is the cause instead of understanding that complications have developed because blood sugar has been high for years,” Heller said by email.    Patients need to understand that insulin can help them quickly feel better and get their diabetes under control, said Dr. Vanessa Arguello, an endocrinologist at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles, who wasn’t involved in the study.    But there’s a lot people can do to minimize the odds that they will need insulin, Arguello said by email.    “The key to avoiding insulin begins with making lifestyle changes early in the disease process – this can be as early as when people are diagnosed with pre-diabetes,” Arguello said. “It is immensely rewarding to see the positive effects form a carbohydrate-controlled diet, exercise, and weight loss on type 2 diabetes control - plus collectively it’s the most inexpensive option for optimal glucose control.”  "
2xyjeFE,2017-09-27,Air pollution linked to kidney disease risk," (Reuters Health) - Breathing dirty air may increase the risk for kidney problems, a study in U.S. veterans suggests.   “Air pollution is a risk factor for kidney disease development,” Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly of the Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System in St. Louis, Missouri, who helped conduct the research, told Reuters Health by phone. “You can argue that it’s even more of a problem in countries like China or India, where pollution is much, much, much worse.”   Dr. Al-Aly and his team studied particulate matter (PM), tiny fragments produced by fossil fuel combustion and other industrial processes, that can be inhaled deep into the lungs. High levels of PM 2.5 - meaning particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers across - are associated with heart disease, stroke, diabetes and a shorter life span.   To investigate whether PM might harm the kidneys as well, the researchers looked at more than eight years’ worth of data on nearly 2.5 million military veterans, using county-by-county pollution data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Vets living in counties with the highest PM levels were more likely to be African-American and to have high blood pressure and diabetes - both of which are also risk factors for kidney disease - as well as heart disease.   The risk that the veterans’ kidney function would worsen over time rose in tandem with the level of pollution they were exposed to at the study’s outset. Higher PM concentrations in the air were also associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal disease, in which the kidney can no longer filter blood effectively and a person requires dialysis to stay alive.   When Dr. Al-Aly and his colleagues repeated the analysis using National Aeronautics and Space Administration satellite pollution data, the results were consistent.   Nearly 45,000 new cases of kidney disease are diagnosed each year in the U.S., and it’s possible that some of those might be due to PM 2.5 pollution that exceeds EPA standards, according to the researchers. But even levels well below the EPA threshold are associated with significant risk, Dr. Al-Aly said.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment, so it can’t prove that air pollution actually caused the kidney problems. Some other health- or lifestyle-related factors might be to blame.    Still, Dr. Aly-Aly said, studies in animals have shown that particles breathed into the lungs can reach the kidneys via the bloodstream, causing inflammation and oxidative stress within the blood-filtering organs.    Dr. Jennifer Bregg-Gresham of the Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor reviewed the research for Reuters Health. “It has been known for a while that air pollution increases the risks for heart and lung problems. These new findings support that even low levels of fine particulate matter air pollution across the US can increase the risk of serious kidney problems,” she told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “Given the millions of people with and at-risk for kidney disease who are impacted by air pollution, this has serious public health implications.”   She noted that people can reduce their personal exposure to PM air pollution with indoor air filtration and, in heavily polluted cities, wearing a validated respirator N95 facemask. Both measures can also reduce blood pressure, Dr. Bregg-Gresham added.   “Unfortunately, as of yet there have been no large scale studies proving that these measures can prevent actual heart, lung or other adverse health effects (like kidney disease). As such, for the time being each person needs to have a discussion with their health care provider about using these measures and if they may be warranted for them based upon their health status and risks of exposure,” she said.   “Air pollution is bad for everyone. Those that are frail or have known chronic diseases are the most vulnerable, in general. This study adds to the literature in the field and further promotes the case for lowering air pollution levels beyond even current standards, for its larger societal benefit, especially for at risk populations, and supports continued research in this area.”  "
2wRYidw,2017-09-26,"‘Caregiver burden’ affects people with sick pets, too"," (Reuters Health) - Dog and cat owners may experience “caregiver burden” when taking care of their sick animals, a new study shows.   This type of stress, which occurs when taking care of a loved one, is linked with depression, anxiety and poorer quality of life, the study authors wrote in the journal Veterinary Record.   “The majority of pet owners consider their pet to be a family member, and prior research has demonstrated that many pet owners experience significant grief when a pet passes away,” coauthor Dr. Mary Beth Spitznagel of Kent State University in Ohio told Reuters Health by email.   Her team expected that people with chronically or terminally ill pets would show greater caregiver burden, but “we did not anticipate just how high the level of burden would be,” Spitznagel said.   She and her colleagues studied 119 adults with chronically or terminally ill dogs or cats, along with another 119 adults with similar animals that were healthy although significantly younger, on average, than the pets in the illness group.   Pet owners in the study were primarily well-educated, well-off middle-aged white women. Many owners of ill pets belonged to a social media group related to their pet’s disease.   In general, pet owners with chronically ill pets had higher levels of burden, stress and anxiety and lower levels of functioning and quality of life. Interestingly, owners who were part of a social media pet disease group had higher level of depressive symptoms. The research team didn’t find any differences based on owner age or gender.   “As our relationships with animals are changing, studies like these help to further explore the ways in which human health is affected - and not always in a positive direction,” said Dr. Katherine Goldberg of Whole Animal Veterinary Geriatrics and Hospice Services in Ithaca, New York. Goldberg, who wasn’t involved with this study, wrote an accompanying commentary about caregiver burden in Veterinary Record.   “I think there is quite a lot of popularization of the notion that pets are ‘good for you’ and that strong attachments to animals are generally desirable and even therapeutic,” she told Reuters Health by email. “But this study points to the complexity of human-animal relationships.”   Future studies should investigate how caregiver burden affects veterinarians, the study authors said. Stressed pet owners likely need more communication and time in the office. Plus, more time in the office could mean more work burden and stress for veterinarians.   “A burdened pet owner might be more likely to attribute a small change in their pet’s behavior to the disease,” Spitznagel said. “Their stress may cause them to worry more and seek support from the veterinarian that goes beyond the pet’s treatment.”   Including caregiver burden in veterinary school curriculum could help address this, Goldberg added.    “As I tell my students, ‘None of your patients will drive themselves to your clinic,’” she said. “A commitment to developing human helping skills . . . is really critical.”   Some veterinary practices are incorporating social workers into their team, and Goldberg sees the trend becoming more prevalent in the next 10 years.    “The take-home for me is not doom and gloom regarding how stressful life can be,” she said. “Rather, it’s to use this as a catalyst for discussion . . . What kind of support would make this experience feel more manageable, and what does that look like?”  "
2yG9dUy,2017-09-26,Cell phone use by expectant mothers not tied to brain problems in kids," (Reuters Health) - Pregnant women who use cell phones may be no more likely to have kids with brain development problems than expectant mothers who avoid mobile devices, a recent study suggests.    “We found no evidence of a harmful effect of the mother using her cell phone during pregnancy on her child’s neurodevelopment at 3 and 5 years,” said senior study author Dr. Jan Alexander of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.    “To our surprise, the more the mother was using her cell phone during pregnancy, the better language and motor skills her child had at 3 years of age,” Alexander said by email. “A similar finding for father’s use, however, points to other lifestyle factors and not the physical impact of cell phones.”   Some previous research, primarily in animals, has raised concerns about whether exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields from cell phones might harm developing babies’ brains. But results have been mixed, and many of the studies have been too small or brief to assess the long-term impact of cell phone exposure on child development, researchers note in BMC Public Health.    For the current study, researchers examined data on 45,389 mother-child pairs, surveying women about their cell phone use during pregnancy and their child’s language, communication and motor skills at age 3 and 5.    Overall, about 10 percent of the women said they never or rarely used cell phones while they were pregnant, while 39 percent were considered “low” users, 47 percent were “medium” users and about 4 percent were “high” users.    Researchers considered women low users if they were on cell phones a few times a week and medium users if they were on mobile devices daily. The high users were on cell phones at least an hour every day.    Compared to kids born to women who rarely if ever used cell phones during pregnancy, children of cell phone users had a 27 percent lower risk of having low sentence complexity, 14 percent lower risk of incomplete grammar and 31 percent lower risk of having moderate language delay at age 3, the study found.    Children born to mobile phone users also had an 18 percent lower risk of low motor skills at age 3.    The study isn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how cell phone exposure during pregnancy might influence child development. Parents also might have provided inaccurate information on their child’s language development.    Even so, the findings should reassure expectant mothers that using a cell phone won’t necessarily harm babies’ developing brains, the researchers conclude.    But other research has linked cell phone exposure to developmental problems like hyperactivity, and one study isn’t enough to settle questions about the safety of exposing babies to mobile phones in utero, said Laura Birks, a researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) who wasn’t involved in the study.    “I would not say that women have no reason to worry about cell phone use during pregnancy,” Birks said by email.    “While this study demonstrates a correlation between high cell phone use and improved language and motor skills in the child, we cannot conclude that this relationship is causal or that the child is not experiencing some other adverse effect of radio frequency exposure,” Birks added.    “If pregnant women want to reduce radiofrequency exposure while taking on the phones, they can use the hands-free function while talking on the phone and avoid holding the phone next to the abdomen,” Birks advised.

2jQOkmu,2017-09-22,Some youth football drills raise head-impact risk more than others," (Reuters Health) - Several youth football drills expose young athletes to head impacts more frequently and more roughly than others, according to a U.S. study that followed 10- and 11-year-old players for a full season.   Modifying and eliminating certain high-intensity drills could reduce head hits, concussions and injuries at both the youth and professional levels of football, the study authors write in the Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics.   “The majority of the head impacts an athlete receives are from practice,” said senior author Jillian Urban of the Wake Forest School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.   “However, our understanding of head impact exposure within on-field activities, such as practice drills, is limited,” she told Reuters Health by email. “This research . . . can help inform coaches, organizations and leagues about methods to restructure practice.”   Head impacts can lead to concussions and symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea and amnesia. Past studies have also suggested that even sub-concussive impacts may contribute to changes in cognitive skills and physical brain changes seen among youth, high school and college-level players, the authors note.   To understand how often and how hard youth players experience head impacts in practice, Urban and colleagues recruited a team belonging to the American Youth Football league to participate in the study.   Players wore sensors on their helmets to measure impacts and acceleration, and researchers videotaped all practices during the preseason, regular season and playoffs. The study team identified 11 types of drills the players used in practice, including dummy/sled tackling, one-on-one, open-field tackling, passing, position skill work, multiplayer tackle and scrimmage.    They recorded 2,125 impacts among nine athletes during 30 practices. The number of head impacts each player experienced during the season ranged from a low of 83 to a high of 459, with a median of 231.   Open-field tackling, a one-on-one tackling drill with starting positions more than three yards apart, had the highest average head acceleration and produced the hardest hits.    The multi-player tackle drill, a blocking drill that involves several athletes, had the highest number of hits but among the lowest-magnitude impacts.    A tackling drill known as Oklahoma, involving two-on-two or three-on-three maneuvers, had the second highest number of impacts. Only the dummy/sled tackling drill had no head impacts.   Overall, researchers found, head impact was most common at the front of the head.    During the practices, a certified athletic trainer monitored the players for concussions, and none of the impacts resulted in a diagnosed concussion. Only two muscle strain injuries were recorded during the practices.   “We need to ask ourselves - is it more important to reduce the high number of severity impacts associated with a drill, or is it more important to target reducing higher severity impact? The answer may be both,” Steven Rowson of Virginia Tech and State University in Blacksburg, Virginia, who wasn’t involved with the study, said by email.   In 2012, Heads Up Football, a USA Football safety program, and Pop Warner Little Scholars, one of the largest youth football programs in the U.S., eliminated full-speed head-on blocking or tackling drills with players more than three yards apart. They also restricted contact at practice to either 40 minutes or one-third of the total weekly practice time. The Pop Warner changes still allow full-speed drills where athletes approach each other at an angle, rather than straight on, which is similar to the open-field tackling drill in this study.   “Much of the debate surrounding head impact in sports lacks solid data to inform the discussion,” Dr. Jason Druzgal of the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville said by email. “Having a way to objectively measure head impact allows decisions about regulating practices to be made on real data, rather than on speculation and fear.”   Some drills that cause more head impact than others, such as one-on-one tackles, may be obvious, even to casual observers, said Druzgal, who wasn’t involved in the study. Helmets used in studies like these accurately measure head impact, but the technology can’t yet be used as a “concussion detector,” he said.  "
2yvBptq,2017-09-22,Resistance exercise linked to reduced anxiety," (Reuters Health) - People who do resistance exercises like weight lifting may experience less anxiety than people who don’t workout, a research review suggests   Researchers analyzed data from 16 previously published studies with a total of 922 participants who were randomly assigned to do resistance training or be inactive.    Resistance workouts were associated with a reduction in anxiety symptoms regardless of whether or not participants had a mental health disorder, though the effect was more pronounced in healthy people who didn’t report any physical or psychological problems.    “The positive effects of exercise training on mental health are well established; however, the majority of this knowledge is based on studies involving aerobic based training,” said lead study author Brett Gordon, a physical education and sports researcher at the University of Limerick in Ireland.   “RET (resistance exercise training) significantly reduced anxiety in both healthy participants and those with a physical or mental illness, and the effect size of these reductions is comparable to that of frontline treatments such as medication and psychotherapy,” Gordon said by email. “RET is a low-cost behavior with minimal risk, and can be an effective tool to reduce anxiety for healthy and ill alike.”   Because the analysis only focused on resistance training, the results can’t show whether this type of activity might be better or worse than aerobic or other types of exercise for easing anxiety symptoms.    While the effects of resistance exercise on the brain are not as well understood as the impact of aerobic workouts, emerging research has also linked resistance training to less shrinkage of white matter in the brain, said Dianna Purvis Jaffin of the Brain Performance Institute at the University of Texas at Dallas.   White matter is composed of nerve fibers that connect neurons in different parts of the brain. Changes in white matter can occur with age, and are thought to be involved in cognitive and behavioral problems.   It’s possible that exercise might help ease anxiety simply by distracting people from how they’re feeling and giving them something else to focus on, Jaffin, who wasn’t involved in the current study, said by email.    “Exercise generally requires some level of concentration on the activity and may serve as a distraction, and at least acutely (meaning - during that bout of exercise and a bit after) interrupt rumination and obsessive worrying,” Jaffin said.    “Finally, since people with anxiety tend to have uncertainty about their future, they may obsessively worry and lack confidence,” Jaffin added. “Exercise can improve self-efficacy, the belief that one can succeed in particular situations, which may make someone feel more empowered.”   While the amount of exercise may influence the impact of workouts on mental health, there isn’t enough evidence available yet to prescribe a specific amount of activity, said Steven Petruzzello, a body mechanics researcher at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who wasn’t involved in the study.    Absent this sort of prescription, choosing an enjoyable workout makes sense, Petruzzello said by email.    In the current analysis, people did resistance exercises on two to five days per week for an average of 11 weeks.   “The best advice at the present time is to ‘just do it’ - it being whatever the person finds enjoyable or at least tolerable,” Petruzzello said. “For some that might mean going for a walk, for others it might entail more vigorous forms of activity.”  "
2fcHpyA,2017-09-21,Dozens of alcohol-flavored tobacco products may lure teens," (Reuters Health) - Nearly 50 alcohol-flavored tobacco product lines are marketed by more than 400 tobacco brands in the United States and these products may especially attract teens, luring them into tobacco addiction, according to a new study.   Adolescent drinking and smoking tend to go hand in hand, the authors write in the journal Tobacco Control, and the combination of alcohol flavors in tobacco products is sure to appeal to teen users.   So-called characterizing flavors in cigarettes, except for menthol, are banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and these restrictions should be extended to the many flavored tobaccos for cigars, cigarillos and hookahs, as well as e-cigarette liquids, they add.   “We were surprised by the large number of brands of alcohol-flavored tobacco products on the market and the wide variety of alcoholic flavors,” said lead author Dr. Robert Jackler of Stanford University in California.    “Not surprisingly, sweet and fruity varieties . . . which appeal to teenagers predominated,” he told Reuters Health by email.    Jackler and colleagues analyzed the top 20 U.S. brands of cigarillos and e-cigarettes using the Nielsen database, which includes unit sales in 25 major chains and 14,000 convenience stores. They also looked for the top hookah and shisha brands online. Then they searched among the top brands for products with flavors related to alcoholic beverages such as beer, appletini and margarita.   The research team found 455 e-cigarette brands and more than 100 flavored cigar, cigarillo and hookah brands. The most popular fruity flavors were pina colada, mojito and margarita, and the most popular spirit flavors were rum, bourbon and whiskey.    The cigars and cigarillos were marketed by large, multinational tobacco companies such as Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco, Swisher International, Swedish Match and Scandinavian Tobacco Group, and the e-cigarette flavors were nearly all offered by minor brands, the study team notes.   “We found it disturbing that major international tobacco companies, which claim to be socially responsible and who profess they would never target underage youth, produce a wide spectrum of flavored mini-cigars and e-cigarettes, including quite a few with alcohol-themed names,” Jackler said.   In 2009, the FDA banned flavors other than menthol from traditional cigarettes, but rulings about e-cigarettes and other tobacco products are still under discussion. Since 2009, California cities such as San Francisco, Oakland, Sonoma, El Cerrito, Manhattan Beach and Berkeley have banned some flavored tobacco products.    In June, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously banned flavored tobacco. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, which makes Newport menthol cigarettes, is reported to have spent $700,000 on a campaign to collect 34,000 signatures and bring a referendum before city voters. The choice will be on the ballot in June 2018.    “If R.J. Reynolds spent this much money on a local policy in one city, they’re sending a message that these bans could severely hurt their business and affect who smokes,” said Dr. Pamela Ling of the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine, who wasn’t involved with the study.   “We’re going to see vociferous conversations about tobacco flavors in coming months (in San Francisco),” she told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “I think some people were misled when they were asked to sign the petition and didn’t realize what it was about.”   Jackler and colleagues are now studying how flavored products are advertised to appeal to teens. They’re comparing the differences on social media channels such as Twitter, which predominantly appeals to adult smokers, and Instagram, which appeals to younger smokers, he said.   “Our overall goal is to provide legislators and regulators with the evidence they need to enact effective regulations to protect American teens,” Jackler said.   Ling encourages parents to be informed and take a stand in their communities as well.   “Parents should take action and say they don’t want these products in their stores or neighborhoods,” she said. “There’s not a good scientific reason to leave these products on the market. We should protect our young people.”  "
2fFzVVw,2017-09-22,Intensive rehab can help military patients work after brain injuries," (Reuters Health) - Four in five military service members who suffer brain injuries may be able to return to military or civilian work after they get treatment at inpatient rehabilitation facilities, a UK study suggests.    Almost one-third of these service members can return to a full-time military job after intensive rehab, the study also found.    The results suggest that the costs of treatment in residential rehabilitation programs can pay off in the long run, said Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Markus Besemann, a chief of rehabilitation medicine for the Canadian Forces Health Services and a lecturer at the University of Ottawa.    “We know that the rates for returning to sustained work are generally poor for both military service members and civilians for a number of reasons,” Besemann, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   “The results of this study are encouraging in that a substantial proportion of military personnel were able to return to military-specific function with appropriate intensive rehabilitation,” Besemann added.  “Although the costs of such programs are substantial, the investment pays dividends when factored out over the lifetime of the individual who is able to re-integrate the same or an alternate vocation.”   For the study, Dr. Sardar Bahadur of the Defense Medical Rehabilitation Center Headley Court in Surrey, UK, and colleagues examined survey data on employment for military patients discharged from inpatient rehab programs for brain injuries between 2012 and 2014. Dr. Bahadur didn’t respond to requests for comment.    During the study period, an average of 57 patients were discharged from rehab each year. Researchers were able to contact just under half of these former patients.   Overall, 81 percent of the study participants were either working or in job training two to three years after leaving rehab, the study team reports in the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps.    Thirty-two percent of them returned to full-time jobs in the military within this time frame, and 40 percent had civilian jobs.    The severity of brain injuries didn’t appear to significantly influence the odds of employment, the study also found.    Two things did appear to increase the odds of a successful return to work after brain injuries: trial placements in jobs to make sure the work is a good fit for the employee and programs that allow for gradual re-entry into the workforce instead of a full-time role right after rehab.   Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the lack of data beyond three years, which makes it difficult to say whether service members might have a full military career or long-term success in the civilian workforce.    In addition, it’s possible that people with less successful employment prospects after their brain injuries might have declined to participate in the survey.    “We know that most service members with concussion do return to work in the short-term but longer term many have PTSD or other mental health conditions and these have the potential to worsen after discharge from the military,” said Dr. Jack Tsao, a researcher at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis and Memphis Veterans Affairs Medical Center who wasn’t involved in the study.    However, the potential for even people with severe brain injuries to return to work after inpatient rehabilitation should be encouraging to military and civilian patients alike, Tsao said by email.    “Severity of brain injury should not put people off from seeking the best brain injury rehabilitation care center to get rehabilitation and therapies,” Tsao said.

2flvGSd,2017-09-21,Guns help explain difference in urban and rural suicide rates," (Reuters Health) - Suicides rates may be higher in rural America than in cities at least in part because gun ownership is more common outside of urban areas, a recent study suggests.    For the study, researchers examined data on 6,196 adult suicides from 2003 to 2015 in the state of Maryland. Overall, suicide rates were 35 percent higher in rural counties than in urban counties, the study found.    Firearm suicide rates were 66 percent higher in rural counties than in urban counties, the study also found. But there wasn’t a meaningful difference in suicide rates for cases that didn’t involve guns.    “For patients and physicians, this study further illustrates the life-or-death importance of discussing firearm ownership as a healthcare issue,” said lead study author Dr. Paul Nestadt of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.    “Doctors need to be asking their patients about firearm access, right alongside asking about diet choices, seatbelt use, and other behavioral contributors to mortality risk,” Nestadt said by email. “This is especially true for patients at any risk for suicide.”   In particular, doctors need to pay close attention to gun use and mental health for men, the study results suggest.    That’s because 89 percent of the gun-related suicides occurred among men, and because the higher rural suicide rate was only true for men.    Firearm suicide rates were 36 percent higher for rural men than urban men. But rural women were 37 percent less likely to commit suicide than urban women, regardless of the method.    This may be explained at least in part by men tending to prefer guns as their method of suicide, researchers note in the American Journal of Public Health.    Most of the suicides in the study happened where the majority of people in Maryland live – in metropolitan areas with at least 1 million residents.    Just 218 suicides, or 3.5 percent, occurred in rural communities.    One limitation of the study is that researchers relied on data from medical examiner reports to identify people who died by suicide, the authors note.    Results from Maryland also might not reflect what would happen elsewhere in the U.S., particularly because the state has enacted permit laws that can make it more difficult to purchase a new gun, the authors also point out.    Rural communities in Maryland are also much more densely populated than remote areas of many other U.S. states, noted Dr. Eliot Nelson, a researcher at the University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine in Burlington who wasn’t involved in the study.    Still, the study results underscore the importance of safe gun and ammunition storage as one tool to help prevent suicide attempts involving firearms, Nelson said by email.    “Access to guns in the home creates a higher risk of suicide for family members whether or not there are known mental health concerns,” Nelson said. “Secure gun storage - locked, preferably in a storage cabinet, and unloaded with ammunition locked up separately - should be routine in gun-owning homes.”   When a household member does have mental health problems or is coping with a serious life crisis, then the best way to protect them is by removing guns from the home altogether, Nelson added.    “Store them temporarily with other relatives, close friends, local resources or local police until the crisis has passed,” Nelson advised.

2xuCDqO,2017-09-21,Many drug companies fail to conduct timely safety checks on medicines after FDA approval," (Reuters Health) - In the rush to approve new medicines, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration often requires drug companies to study possible side effects and alternative doses for medicines once they hit the broader market.                    FILE PHOTO: Bottles of medications line the shelves at a pharmacy in Portsmouth, Ohio, June 21, 2017.   REUTERS/Bryan Woolston       A new analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine concludes that, in many cases, that’s not being done.   Dr. Steven Woloshin of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in Lebanon, New Hampshire, and colleagues looked at federal records and found that among the 614 studies mandated in 2009 and 2010, 20 percent were never started and 9 percent have been delayed.   “When drugs are approved, the trials are usually small and short-term, and some side effects may not emerge until the post-marketing phase,” Woloshin told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “The problem is, the faster you get them on the market, the more open questions there are” about their safety or the best dose.   In a response published in the Journal, the FDA said that by its tally, 88 percent of all postmarketing requirements - not just those mandated in 2009 and 2010 - “were progressing according to their original schedules” as of the 2015 fiscal year.   One of four drug companies contacted by Reuters Health provided evidence that the information about its post-approval registry reported by the Woloshin team is inaccurate.   With President Donald Trump vowing to further speed the FDA approval process, “Drug approval is likely to become increasingly rapid and rely on looser evidence standards,” the Woloshin team writes in its report. “It will be crucial to ensure that the important questions that are unanswered at the time of approval are resolved as quickly as possible, too.”   One example of missed deadlines is Indivior’s Suboxone, a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone used to treat opioid dependence. The FDA wanted to know if it caused a specific problem with the heart.   “The sponsor was given more than 1 year to submit the trial protocol and 5 years to complete the trial,” the study authors write. “Nevertheless, as of July 2017, the final protocol had apparently not been submitted.”   And when Novartis’ $72,000-a-year multiple sclerosis treatment Gilenya (fingolimod) was approved, the FDA told the company to test a lower daily dose.   “Sometimes a lower dose may be as effective, but have fewer side effects,” Woloshin explained.   Yet “more than 6 years after approval, the trial had not been completed because of recruitment difficulties despite the manufacturer reporting $2.8 billion in sales,” the researchers write.   The company released a statement to Reuters Health saying recruitment was slow because multiple sclerosis therapy has evolved. Results of the study are expected in the second half of next year.   One example cited by the researchers is being challenged. The case involves Victoza, Novo Nordisk’s widely-prescribed drug for type 2 diabetes. Animal tests showed it might cause thyroid cancer. The FDA ordered the company to create a 15-year registry to record cases of thyroid cancer among users. The deadline for submitting rules for running the registry was July 2010.   The Woloshin team contends that no protocol for the registry has been submitted and cites an FDA website showing the registry as “Delayed.”   But company spokesman Ken Inchausti supplied a link to the trial on the website clinicaltrials.gov showing that enrollment began in January 2012. He told Reuters Health in an email that 996 patients have been interviewed to date.   Woloshin and colleagues write that their data show 16 percent of the ongoing studies are on schedule.    “Although being on schedule is reassuring, we would argue that some FDA-specified schedules are too long,” they write. The team believes the FDA should set shorter deadlines and impose penalties when companies miss these deadlines.   “For example,” they write, “the schedule for a 1-year pediatric safety and efficacy study for Welchol (colesevelam), used to assess treatment effects on type 2 diabetes in children . . . allowed 6 years for completion; an additional 4-year extension was also granted.”   The drug is marketed in the U.S. by Daiichi Sankyo, Japan’s second largest pharmaceutical company.   In some cases, the FDA has simply dropped a requirement for a postapproval study without giving a reason. “Adding this information to its public postapproval database would increase transparency,” Woloshin’s team writes.   The FDA statement does not directly respond to the suggestions. “Over time, advances in science, changes in standards of care, and new clinical information can affect study feasibility, design requirements, and even the need for or the appropriateness of a study,” the agency said.   “The FDA tracks these circumstances carefully and works with manufacturers to ensure that the postmarketing requirement or commitment study provides the information needed for public health,” it added.  "
2y9rMiZ,2017-09-21,Undetected fractures linked to back pain in older men," (Reuters Health) - About three in five older men with tiny spinal fractures related to osteoporosis reported new or worsening back pain in a new study.   Only about one-quarter of new vertebral fractures are diagnosed by a doctor, the study team writes in Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, though they may be a source of unexplained back pain.    Preventing these fractures could reduce back pain and related disability in older men, the authors conclude.   “Even when spine fractures are not recognized or diagnosed by a clinician, they still may cause new or worsening back pain and disability in some patients,” lead author Dr. Howard Fink, a researcher at the Veterans Affairs Health Center in Minneapolis, told Reuters Health by email.   Vertebral fractures are a common problem in older adults with osteoporosis, or weakening of the bones. However, most research has been done on older women, and the current study is the first of its kind to focus on older men, the study team notes.    The researchers examined data from about 4,400 men who were over age 65 when they enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men study between 2000 and 2002. The men lived in one of six cities: Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, Portland, San Diego, Birmingham, Alabama and Palo Alto, California.    Each participant filled out back-pain symptom questionnaires at the beginning of the study and again about four and a half years later. In addition, each man had X-rays of the middle and lower back at the start, and again at the follow-up.    A total of 28 men were diagnosed with vertebral fractures by their own physicians during the follow-up. However, X-rays taken at the end of the study period showed an additional 169 men had new vertebral fractures that had not been diagnosed.    The study team found that 70 percent of men with undiagnosed vertebral fractures reported back pain compared to 59 percent of men with no vertebral fractures. About 93 percent of the men who had their fractures diagnosed during the study also reported back pain.   “Back pain is the most common symptom (of vertebral fractures),” Fink said.   It may be important to note the men in the study who had the undetected fractures tended to be older, have poorer health status and often had a history of vertebral fractures.   “This study demonstrates similar findings to that in elderly women, albeit at a lower prevalence. This is consistent with findings that men have a lower prevalence of osteoporosis than elderly women,” Dr. Aaron Buckland, director of research at New York University Langone’s Spine Center in New York City, told Reuters Health in an email.    Many factors may cause osteoporosis, some of which are modifiable, noted Buckland, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D and exposure to sunlight are important in maintaining bone mineral density. Regular weight-bearing exercises also help in maintaining bone mineral density,” he said.   Medical management of common endocrine conditions such as thyroid, adrenal or pituitary dysfunction as well as hypogonadism are other important factors in the elderly population to prevent secondary osteoporosis, Buckland said.   Avoidance of osteoporotic fractures, including vertebral and hip fractures, “is an important preventative management goal in patients with osteoporosis,” he said.   Although back pain is the primary symptom of a vertebral fracture, most back pain is due to something else, Buckland added. Most episodes of back pain are muscular in nature and last for less than six weeks and normally respond well to over the counter anti-inflammatory medicines and core strengthening exercises, he said.   “If you are experiencing persistent back pain for more than 6 weeks, or have associated weakness, numbness, bladder or bowel disturbance, or when pain is not adequately controlled, this is when you should seek medical evaluation and imaging,” Buckland said.

2xfrni7,2017-09-20,Egg freezing may not delay chemo for breast cancer patients," (Reuters Health) - Women diagnosed with breast cancer who want to freeze their eggs and embryos before tumor treatment leads to infertility can do this without delaying the start of chemotherapy, a U.S. study suggests.    Researchers focused on 89 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer who received counseling at a fertility clinic about a relatively new technique known as random-start ovarian stimulation. This process doesn’t wait for a woman’s natural menstrual cycle to stimulate the ovaries to release eggs and can be done in about two weeks, compared with four to six weeks with older ovarian stimulation techniques timed to coincide with menstruation.    Overall, 67 of the women proceeded with random-start ovarian stimulation before beginning cancer treatment.    With fertility treatment, women started chemotherapy an average of 38 days after their breast cancer diagnosis, compared with 39 days when patients decided against fertility preservation.    “What this tells us is these women can still go on to build a family,” said senior study author Dr. Mitchell Rosen, a reproductive health researcher at the University of California San Francisco.    “It only takes two weeks, and it isn’t going to cause any delay in their cancer treatment,” Rosen said in a telephone interview.    When chemotherapy is needed soon after a breast cancer diagnosis, doctors generally advise that it begin within four to six weeks to avoid hurting women’s survival odds.   Chemotherapy can cause infertility by damaging the ovaries and by triggering an early menopause in women of childbearing age.    For the study, researchers examined data from medical records for breast cancer patients between the ages of 18 and 45 who were referred to the UCSF Center for Reproductive Health between 2011 and 2017 before starting chemotherapy.    Women started chemotherapy at roughly the same time whether or not they decided to first harvest eggs and freeze eggs or embryos, researchers report in Human Reproduction.    One limitation of the study is that it didn’t look at other reasons beyond fertility preservation that might influence how long it takes for women to start chemotherapy, such as tests to pinpoint the type of tumors imaging to find out how far cancer has spread or patients making arrangements to take time off of work or prepare their lives for chemo.    The study also wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how fertility preservation directly influences the time it takes to start chemotherapy, and the results from one fertility center might not represent what all women would experience.    Even so, the findings suggest that random-start ovarian stimulation may be a viable option for women with breast cancer or other types of malignancies who don’t want to lose their ability to have children after tumors are in remission, said Dr. Kutluk Oktay, director of the Innovation Institute for Fertility Preservation and IVF in New York and a researcher at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.    “With this approach, a patient can be started on ovarian stimulation even on the day of the initial consultation and can be done with embryo or egg freezing in two weeks,” Oktay, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “And if she has more time, she can even do multiple cycles of freezing without risking a delay in chemotherapy,” Oktay said. “Random start extends all women who are considering embryo or egg freezing before chemotherapy for any type of cancer more flexibility and ability to preserve fertility with the least delay before initiating ovary damaging cancer treatments.”  "
2wkPnkx,2017-09-20,Benefits of gastric bypass persist for 12 years," (Reuters Health) - Twelve years after gastric-bypass weight-loss surgery, the benefits persist in most patients, leading to long-term weight loss, less diabetes, lower blood pressure and fewer cholesterol problems, according to a study of the technique that has had the longest follow-up so far.   “This study further confirms the long-term durability of gastric bypass surgery,” chief author Dr. Ted Adams of Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City, Utah, told Reuters Health by phone.   “You have an intervention that, 12 years down the road, is helping people maintain a 27 percent weight loss,” said Dr. Jamy Ard, co-director of the Weight Management Center at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.   Because some insurance plans don’t pay for the surgery, “we need to rethink what we will cover from an insurance standpoint,” said Ard, who was not involved in the study.   On average, after 12 years, patients weighed 77 pounds (35 kg) less than they did before the surgery, Adams and colleagues report in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Half of those with type 2 diabetes at the time of surgery were free of it 12 years later.   All of the patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, where surgeons close off all but an egg-size pouch of the stomach and then bypass part of the small intestine. Gastric bypass typically costs $20,000 to $30,000.   Researchers compared 387 patients who had surgery with 378 volunteers who decided against it, typically because insurance would not cover it, and 303 other adults with severe obesity. The team had previously reported benefits of the surgery at the 2- and 6-year marks.   The average starting weight was 295 pounds (134 kg). People who didn’t undergo surgery typically lost just 6 pounds (2.9 kg).    “Despite a wide variation in change in body weight across the sample, 360 of 387 patients (93 percent) in the surgery group maintained at least a 10 percent weight loss from baseline to year 12; 271 (70 percent) maintained at least a 20 percent weight loss; and 155 (40 percent) maintained at least a 30 percent weight loss,” the researchers concluded. “Only 4 of 387 patients (1 percent) in the surgery group had regained all their postsurgical weight loss.”   While 26 percent of patients in the control groups had type 2 diabetes at the 12-year mark, the rate was a mere 3 percent with surgery.    Remission was more likely when a diabetic was not taking insulin, probably because those patients still had enough healthy pancreas cells left to produce insulin.   “The more advanced the type 2 diabetes, the less the glycemic benefit from Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,” the Adams team concluded.   Blood markers for heart disease, such as bad cholesterol, collectively improved more with the surgery. The reduction in high blood pressure was significantly greater compared to one of the control groups but not the other.   Most patients were female and white, so it’s not certain if the results apply as well to other groups.    One troubling finding: there were five suicides in the surgery group and two among people who were not in that group but had bypass surgery outside the study. No people in the other control group took their own lives.   “Whether the increase in suicides is attributable solely to bariatric surgery itself or whether any large, sustained weight loss would also be associated with an increased risk of suicide is unknown,” the researchers wrote.    “It is concerning,” Adams said. “It doesn’t occur very often, but it has been enough that it raises a red flag. A number of groups are looking for the underlying reasons.” For example, rerouting the digestive system might affect how alcohol or mental health medications are metabolized.    Ard of Wake Forest told Reuters Health by phone that the suicide question “highlights the need for comprehensive care” where a behavioral specialist is part of the team that can look for warning signs.   “What we can learn from this paper is that we have a very effective treatment tool for severe obese patients with associated medical problems,” said Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director for bariatric surgery at CHI Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee.   “Also, it is important to see that patients that are not having ‘access’ to bariatric surgery, either because they don’t have specific insurance coverage or have not been educated, will suffer the consequences of remaining severely obese and deterioration of health and quality of life,” he told Reuters Health in an email.   Because people with diabetes typically cost the health system an additional $7,000 per year, said Ard, “you don’t have to do a lot of surgeries to start saving money” if bypass prevents diabetes or puts it in remission.   Fewer than 1 percent of eligible candidates get the surgery, said Ponce, who is past president of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.   “We must change the thinking about obesity and begin to remove the policy, social, medical, discriminatory, economic and perceptual barriers that deny people appropriate treatment and support before more people get sick or die,” Ponce said. “This study supports that treatment for obesity should be an essential health benefit that is provided by all health plans.”  "
2xfbvMB,2017-09-20,CDC issues guidance on storm recovery," NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been using multiple channels to get the word out about post-storm safety to residents of areas still reeling from the effects of recent hurricanes.                    FILE PHOTO:  A general view of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia September 30, 2014. REUTERS/Tami Chappell/File Photo      “Short-term we are concerned about injuries, carbon monoxide poisoning, gastrointestinal problems because of contaminated water or food, mold is a concern and just general infection control-type things,” Dr. Sven Rodenbeck, acting incident manager for the CDC’s response to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “Longer term, probably the biggest thing is mental health.”   In addition to sending personnel and supplies to areas hit by the hurricanes, the CDC, through its Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response, has been posting advisories on topics ranging from safe chainsaw use to post-trauma mental health on Twitter and Facebook.    The CDC is also partnering with businesses to promote safety, Dr. Rodenbeck said, for example by working with Home Depot and Lowe’s to make sure that carbon monoxide monitors are stocked right next to where generators are sold.   Being prepared for hurricanes - or any disaster - can make the aftermath a bit easier, but the CDC notes that just half of U.S. adults have an emergency plan in place or a stock of emergency supplies. The agency provides detailed step-by-step guidelines on emergency planning and preparedness at  bit.ly/2xeGwR5.    Key elements of hurricane preparedness include:   - Making an emergency plan   - Securing a three- to five-day supply of water, non-perishable food, and baby formula and baby food if needed   - Gathering prescription medications, personal care products and emergency supplies, and storing them in an easy-to-reach spot   - Deciding whether to evacuate or stay in place   The CDC provides detailed guidance on safe cleanup, mold prevention, hygiene and other post-hurricane issues at  bit.ly/2xepIJK.

2wZx8zN,2017-09-19,Energy-efficient green buildings may emit hazardous chemicals," (Reuters Health) - Newly renovated low-income housing units in Boston earned awards for green design and building but flunked indoor air-quality tests, a new study shows.   Researchers found potentially carcinogenic levels of toxic chemicals in the remodeled homes before and after residents moved in. All of the 30 eco-friendly homes in the study had risky indoor air concentrations for at least one chemical.    “Even in green buildings, building materials contain chemicals that we’re concerned about from a health perspective,” said lead author Robin Dodson, a researcher at Silent Spring Institute in Newton, Massachusetts.   “We should not only think about the efficiency of the building but the health of the building,” she said in a phone interview.   The hazards seemed to come both from materials used to renovate the housing units as well as from occupants’ furnishings and personal-care products, the study found.   “Synthetic chemicals are ubiquitous in modern life,” said co-author Gary Adamkiewicz, an environmental health professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.   “They’re in new housing, old housing, green housing, conventional housing and high- and low-income housing,” he said by email.   As reported in Environment International, Dodson, Adamkiewicz and colleagues collected air and dust samples from 10 renovated units before occupancy and from 27 units one to nine months after residents moved in between July 2013 and January 2014.    By testing the homes before and after they were occupied, investigators were able to trace the presence of nearly 100 chemicals with known or suspected health concerns to the renovation, the residents or a combination.   Both before and after occupancy, all the tested units had indoor air concentrations of formaldehyde that exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s cancer-based screening level.    The researchers expected formaldehyde, which has been associated with allergy and asthma, might leach out of building materials, and they found evidence that it did. But because formaldehyde emissions remained high after occupancy, the research team suspected that residents also brought formaldehyde in personal-care products.   Researchers also believe that flame retardants, which are suspected of causing cancer and diminishing male fertility, had been added to the building insulation.    To their surprise, they found chemicals used in sunscreen, nail polish and perfumes being emitted from building materials, possibly because they had been added to paint or floor finishes, Dodson said.   Residents appear to have brought into the renovated homes a number of health-disturbing chemicals, including antimicrobials, flame retardants, plastics and fragrances.    Flame retardant BDE-47, which appeared after residents moved in, has been banned since 2005. Dodson assumes residents carried the compound into their homes, possibly in second-hand furniture.   Consumers could improve household air quality by using products free of fragrance and other seemingly innocuous but harmful ingredients, Dodson said. But the onus should not be on consumers, she said.   “Why are manufacturers even allowed to use these chemicals in their products?” she said.   Green building standards should be broadened to prohibit use of hazardous chemicals, she said.    Tom Lent, policy director of the nonprofit Healthy Building Network in Berkeley, California, said the study provides important clues about which hazardous chemicals are being released from building materials so that green buildings can be constructed to be both energy-efficient and healthy.   “There does not need to be a conflict,” Lent, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.   But the conflict between energy-efficient building and the need to reduce toxic indoor air emissions has existed for 15 years, Asa Bradman said by email. Bradman, associate director of the Center for Environmental Research and Children’s Health at the University of California, Berkeley, was not involved with the study.   Adamkiewicz recently completed another study that suggests green buildings can be healthy, or at least healthier, he said.    He studied families who moved from old, conventional housing to new, green public housing units in Boston. The new buildings were designed to save energy and reduce exposures to indoor pollutants.   In the green units, adults wheezed and coughed less and suffered fewer headaches, he found, and children missed fewer school days and had fewer asthma attacks and hospitalizations.  "
2xcwb8b,2017-09-19,Poor sleep associated with higher risk of chronic pain," (Reuters Health) - People who sleep poorly may be more likely to develop a chronic pain condition and have worse physical health, a study from the UK suggests.   A general decline in both the quantity and quality of hours slept led to a two- to three-fold increase in pain problems over time, researchers found.   “Sleep and pain problems are two of the biggest health problems in today’s society,” said lead study author Esther Afolalu of the University of Warwick in Coventry.    Pain is known to interfere with sleep, she told Reuters Health by email. But the new study shows “that the impact of sleep on pain is often bigger than (the impact of) pain on sleep,” she said.   Sleep disturbances, she added, contribute to problems in the ability to process and cope with pain.   Afolalu and colleagues reviewed 16 studies involving more than 60,000 adults from 10 countries. The studies looked at how well people were sleeping at the start, and then evaluated the effects of long-term sleep changes on pain, immune function and physical health. Half the participants were tracked for at least four and a half years.   Overall, sleep reductions led to impaired responses to bacteria, viruses and other foreign substances, more inflammation, higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol and other biomarkers related to pain, fatigue and poor health. Newly developed insomnia doubled the risk of a chronic pain disorder and hip fracture problems, the study authors wrote in the journal Sleep Medicine.    Deterioration in sleep was also associated with worse self-reported physical functioning.   At the same time, researchers didn’t find links between increased sleep and less pain or arthritis, although they did find that improvement in sleep was associated with better physical functioning.   One limitation of the analysis is that the studies relied on participants to recall their own sleep patterns. Also, the studies didn’t all use the same tools to measure sleep quality and quantity.   Future studies should look at sleep patterns for different groups of people and how that affects health, Afolalu said. Her team is now analyzing data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey to understand sleep, insomnia and health for people with arthritis.    Additional studies should also investigate how sleep deficiency leads to chronic pain disorders, said Dr. Monika Haack, who studies sleep, pain and inflammation at Harvard Medical School’s Human Sleep and Inflammatory Systems Lab in Boston.   Haack, who wasn’t involved with the new research, said in an email, “It is also important to identify whether there is a specific sleep pattern that is most dangerous for pain. For example, does sleep disruption (with frequent, intermittent awakening throughout the night) have a higher impact than a short but consolidated sleep?”   Haack and colleagues recently reported in the journal Pain that restricting sleep on weekdays and catching up on the weekends led to more pain. Furthermore, people who caught up on weekends had a tougher time dealing with pain than those who slept eight hours every night.    “In those already suffering from chronic pain, it is of critical importance to incorporate sleep improvement strategies,” Haack said. “And to have sleep specialists as part of the pain management team.”  "
2xbO3jC,2017-09-19,What can studies tell us about whole grains and the heart?," (Reuters Health) - Scientists haven’t yet proved beyond a doubt that a diet rich in whole grains is healthy for the heart, a research review suggests.    Researchers focused only on the gold standard for nutrition experiments: studies that randomly selected some healthy adults to consume lots of whole grains from products like cereal, rice and oats - and other healthy individuals to eat plenty of refined grains like white bread or stick to their usual diets.    None of these experiments tested whether eating whole grains might influence the risk of dying from heart disease or having a heart attack or stroke, the research review found.    All of the experiments did assess how consuming whole grains impacts risk factors for heart disease like blood pressure and cholesterol, however, and none found a difference in these risk factors based on what types of grains people ate.   But there is still a large and undisputed body of evidence documenting the many health benefits of a diet rich in whole grains, said Nour Makarem, a nutrition researcher at Columbia University in New York who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Whole grains have been associated with lower weight gain, better cholesterol, glucose and insulin levels in previous studies, which are risk factors for heart disease,” Makarem said by email.    “Whole grains are also a source of cereal fiber, which has in turn been associated with lower risk for heart disease, obesity and cancer,” Makarem added.    The American Heart Association recommends the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or a Mediterranean-style diet to help prevent cardiovascular disease. Both diets emphasize cooking with vegetable oils with unsaturated fats, eating nuts, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, fish and poultry, and limiting red meat and added sugars and salt.   In the current research review published by the Cochrane Library, the authors conclude that experiments to date testing the heart benefits of whole grains have been too small, too brief, or both, making it impossible to determine how these foods might lead to long-term heart benefits in the general population.    Combined, the nine studies included in the review had only 1,414 participants ranging in age from 24 to 70. None of the studies tested the impact of consuming whole grains for longer than four months.   Senior study author Dr. Karen Rees of the University of Warwick in the UK didn’t respond to requests for comment.    Whole grain foods encompass a range of products and include whole grain wheat, rice, maize, and oats as well as milled whole grains such as oatmeal.   High-fiber grains are only one component of a healthy diet, noted Dr. Margo Denke of Bandera, Texas, a former researcher at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas who wasn’t involved in the current research review.    “We have known for some time that fiber makes a small contribution to altering risk factors for heart disease,” Denke said by email.   “The point is that whole grains, when added to a whole diet of fruits and vegetables (as seen with the DASH diet) do make a difference in cardiovascular risk factors,” Denke said. “One needs to quit asking small modifications to bear the weight of the effects of a complete diet; diet is not a simple thing and diet is a composite, an overall approach to life.”  "
2hcvR2K,2017-09-18,Gun laws targeting domestic abusers tied to fewer homicides," (Reuters Health) - When people convicted of domestic violence or covered by restraining orders are not only banned from buying guns but forced to give up firearms they already own, they may be less likely to murder their intimate partners, a U.S. study suggests.    Every year, more than 1,800 people nationwide are killed by intimate partners, and approximately half of these homicides are committed with firearms, researchers note in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Nearly all the victims are women.    Over the past quarter-century, intimate partner homicide rates were 9.7 percent lower in states with domestic violence gun laws that kept offenders from getting or keeping firearms, and firearm-related intimate partner murder rates were 14 percent lower, the study found.   “Even though federal law prohibits domestic violence offenders from possessing firearms, states are not able to adequately enforce this law without having it adopted as state law as well,” said senior study author Dr. Michael Siegel of the Boston University School of Public Health.   Federal law, however, doesn’t require domestic violence offenders covered by restraining orders to turn in weapons in their possession, Siegel said by email.    “So while existing law could help prevent such a person from purchasing a new gun, it does little to prevent access to guns that a person already owns,” Siegel said.   As of 2015, 26 states prohibited firearm possession by people convicted of domestic violence but only 11 of those states also explicitly required these individuals to relinquish weapons they already owned.    For the current study, researchers examined data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation on intimate partner homicides committed between 1991 and 2015.    Nationwide, the intimate partner murder rate declined from 1.19 victims for every 100,000 people in 1991 to 0.60 victims for every 100,000 people by 2015, the study found.    Over that same period, the firearm-related intimate partner homicide rate decreased from 0.68 to 0.36 victims for every 100,000 people.    Laws that prohibited the possession of firearms by people subject to restraining orders but didn’t require the surrender of guns didn’t appear to have a statistically meaningful impact on intimate partner homicide rates, the study also found.    One limitation of the study is that states with the most gun restrictions might be different in other ways from states with less restrictive laws or none at all, the authors note.    Even so, the findings suggest that laws requiring people subject to restraining orders to give up their guns may save lives, the authors conclude.    “Half of murdered women are shot and killed by their spouse, ex-spouse, intimate partner or ex-partner,” said Dr. Joslyn Fisher of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, co-author of an accompanying editorial.    “If we can get guns, weapons with the greatest lethality risk, out of the hands of potential perpetrators, we can reduce murder by guns and thus make a dent in the total number of women killed by their partners,” Fisher said by email.    For laws to work, however, they need to be enforced, said editorial co-author Amy Bonomi, a human development and family studies researcher at Michigan State University in East Lansing.    “The study is a clear call to law enforcement, prosecutors and other responsible authorities to ensure systematic enforcement of firearm surrender laws,” Bonomi said by email.

2y3vUSr,2017-09-18,Pregnant moms who take folic acid cut autism risk from pesticides," (Reuters Health) - Children whose mothers took folic acid supplements early in their pregnancies were less likely to develop autism, even when the pregnant moms were exposed to pesticides linked to the neurodevelopmental disorder, a new study found.   Mothers who were exposed to household or agricultural pesticides just before and during their pregnancies but who took high-dose folic acid cut in half the risk of their children developing autism when compared to women who received low doses of the vitamin, lead author Rebecca Schmidt said in a phone interview.   “If there’s a chance you might get pregnant, . . . take your folic acid and try to avoid unnecessary pesticides,” said Schmidt, an epidemiologist and professor at the Medical Investigations of Neurodevelopment Disorders (MIND) Institute at the University of California, Davis.   The research confirmed previous studies connecting maternal pesticide exposure to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a developmental disability marked by social, communication and behavioral challenges.   But the report in Environmental Health Perspectives breaks new ground by finding that children prenatally exposed to pesticides were less likely to be diagnosed with autism if their mothers took a high dose of folic acid.   The findings led investigators to conclude that folic acid might reduce, though not eliminate, an increased risk of autism associated with maternal pesticide exposure.   Folic acid, or vitamin B-9, is contained in green leafy vegetables and fortified cereal.    The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and other health groups already urge women with any chance of becoming pregnant to take daily folic acid supplements because B-9 deficiency has long been tied to brain and spinal cord birth defects.   The new findings, in addition to underscoring the importance of folic acid, highlight the role environmental pollutants appear to play in the development of autism, said Joseph Braun, an epidemiologist at the Brown School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island, who was not involved with the study.   “This is another piece of the puzzle for environmental risk factors for autism,” he said in a phone interview. “There has really not been as much attention paid to environmental risk factors for autism as there has been for genetic risk factors.”   An estimated one of every 68 children in the U.S. was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder in 2012, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since the 1990s, rates of autism have spiked across the nation. Boys are 4.5 times more likely to be diagnosed with ASD than girls.    Study participants included 296 children diagnosed with autism and 220 who developed typically. All were between 2 and 5 years old and born in California from 2000 until 2007.    Researchers interviewed the children’s mothers about their folic acid intake as well as their exposure during pregnancy to household pesticides, including pet flea and tick products, professional pest control or extermination, and indoor and outdoor sprays and chemicals intended to kill insects. Investigators also linked data from state pesticide-use reports with mothers’ addresses to determine exposure to agricultural sprays.   Women with below-average folic acid intake and exposure to any indoor pesticides had 2.5 times the risk of having a child with autism compared to unexposed mothers who took at least 800 micrograms of folic acid, the amount in prenatal vitamins.   Mothers who were exposed regularly to pesticides for three months before and after conception were at the highest risk of having children who developed ASD, Schmidt said.    While folic acid reduced the risk of a child developing autism, it did not eliminate it, the study found.   The study relied on mothers’ memories about their household pesticide exposure, a limitation of the research, Schmidt said. But researchers were able to draw similar conclusions from California pesticide-use data as they did from self-reported pesticide usage, strengthening the findings, Braun noted.   The study shows promise for nutritional supplements mitigating the damage from prenatal pollutants, he and Schmidt said.   “Maybe this is a way to attenuate effects of environmental pollutants and contaminants that we don’t really have a lot of control over,” Schmidt said.  "
2x2wy2s,2017-09-15,Oral food challenges safe when performed in doctor&#039;s office," (Reuters Health) - Oral food challenges at the doctor’s office are a safe way to diagnose food allergies, a U.S. study suggests.   Based on records of more than 6,000 food challenge tests done in allergy practices in Houston, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Boston and Indianapolis, researchers found that only 2 percent produced a severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis.    Across practices, just 13 percent to 33 percent of patients had any type of allergic reaction.   In oral food challenges, patients consume a very small amount of food by mouth while doctors watch for an allergic reaction.    “Parents should know it’s safe in a clinic with a physician that’s skilled in performing oral food challenges,” said senior study author Dr. Carla Davis, a pediatric allergist at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston.   Oral food challenge is the current gold standard for food allergy testing, she told Reuters Health by phone. “We don’t have another test that very accurately lets us know if a person is going to react to food if they eat it. The food challenge, unfortunately at this time, is the only way to determine if a person has a life-threatening food allergy or not.”   Past research has mainly focused on experiences at individual allergy clinics, Davis and her colleagues write in the Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. To get a broader picture of the safety of oral food challenges across the U.S., they examined records from five practices over a five-year period.    All tests were performed under the guidance of medical professionals. Most of the patients were under age 18.   Just 2 percent of those being tested experienced anaphylaxis, which requires immediate medical intervention. About 14 percent had mild or moderate reactions such as hives on the skin and were usually treated with antihistamines.    Davis said that if parents suspect their kids have food allergies, the best place to start is with their local allergist.   “They can also see their primary care physician because primary physicians can talk with them about symptoms as well as possibly do some screening laboratory tests to see if they need to go to an allergist,” she said.   Typical symptoms of allergic reactions to food include coughing or wheezing, vomiting and abdominal pain, hives, skin swelling, lip swelling and throat tightness, she said.   “A medically supervised feeding test (oral food challenge) is the most definitive type of allergy test,” said Dr. Scott Sicherer, a pediatric allergist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.    “When the medical history and tests such as blood and or allergy skin tests cannot provide sufficient evidence that a food allergy is present or absent, an oral food challenge can provide the answer,” said Sicherer, who wasn’t involved in the study.   The test food is given very gradually, in increasing amounts, and if the feeding is tolerated then the food can be added to the diet, he said.   “If symptoms develop, the testing is stopped and any treatment is given if needed to reverse symptoms. The test has to be conducted by trained personnel . . . because the test can trigger a severe allergic reaction,” Sicherer said by email.   This study reassures about the safety of the procedure, he added. “This is a very necessary and often underutilized test because it gives such important information that can be life-changing.”   Still, Sicherer cautions, the test is not without serious risks. “The report includes primarily children deemed already to be unlikely allergic, and was conducted in centers that are very experienced,” he said. “The input and supervision of experienced allergists is key to promote safety.”  "
2wd2XGn,2017-09-15,Obese minority children less likely to have weight-loss surgery," (Reuters Health) - Obese white teens in the U.S. are much more likely obese black or Hispanic teens to be treated with weight loss surgery, according to a recent study.   That’s despite the fact that minority kids are disproportionately affected by rising childhood obesity rates in the U.S.    Bariatric surgery, which includes several approaches to shrinking the stomach so patients eat less, has been shown to help with weight loss and reversing health conditions that come with obesity, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Current guidelines recommend the procedure for adolescents with serious or severe obesity who haven’t been able to lose weight with other treatments.   While 4.5 million children and adolescents in the U.S. are obese, few teens undergo bariatric surgery, the study team reports in Journal of Adolescent Health. And white teens are more than twice as likely as their minority counterparts to have the procedure.   “We’ve known for a long time that health disparities exist in adults, but people don’t think about it with children and teens,” said senior author Dr. Kanika Bowen-Jallow, a pediatric surgeon at University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.   “You wouldn’t suspect it because we have coverage for children through their parent’s insurance or Medicaid, so 90 percent of kids should be covered,” she told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “But in reality, there is a difference.”   Pediatric obesity rates are on the rise, with 33 percent of children considered overweight and 9 percent considered severely obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    Childhood obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, liver disease and reflux problems, the authors write. Bariatric surgery is an option for teens with severe obesity who can’t lose weight after six months of behavioral and medical treatments.   “For parents and doctors, it’s hard to have that conversation that a child is overweight,” Bowen-Jallow said. “But it’s something that will follow children into adulthood.”   Bowen-Jallow and colleagues analyzed national data on obesity rates to identify how many teens would be candidates for bariatric surgery. They also examined records for bariatric surgery cases in the U.S. between 2007 and 2014 to understand what characteristics were associated with teens who got the surgery.    They found that 1,539 adolescents between ages 12 and 19 underwent bariatric surgery during the study period.    After surgery, weight loss and improvements in obesity-related health conditions didn’t differ based on race or sex, researchers found.     “Childhood obesity is an epidemic that disproportionately affects minorities,” Bowen-Jallow said. “It’s important to realize your cultural background has a profound effect on treatment.”   Researchers don’t yet know why exactly this is the case, said Dr. Leslie Heinberg of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Do doctors suggest bariatric surgery when they see obese women or obese Caucasians more?” she said in a phone interview. “Or is there a self-referral or cultural difference?”   Future research should look at the behavior, psychology and adherence patterns of patients to better understand the referral patterns and success of weight-loss surgery among different groups, Heinberg said.    “Behavioral factors can help predict which people will lose weight and who will keep it off,” she noted. “For adolescents, we’re not just thinking 10 to 20 years down the road, but a lifetime.”   “One piece of good news was that minority patients were more likely to receive gastric bypass surgery, which is among the most effective procedures for weight loss,” said Dr. Lauren Hersch Nicholas of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who wasn’t involved in the study.   In some states, Medicaid doesn’t cover bariatric surgery, and some insurance companies don’t cover patients until they are 18, Heinberg added, which can further limit options no matter the patient’s race or ethnicity.   “Bariatric surgery can be an option for the right adolescent,” she said. “It is a lifelong decision with lifelong consequences. Patients and parents should carefully prepare and find the right place with the right care,” she said by email.  "
2f9A5aN,2017-09-14,ACA Medicaid expansion tied to earlier cancer care for the poor," (Reuters Health) - After the Affordable Care Act (ACA) helped reduce the number of uninsured Americans, more low-income adults got cancer diagnosed when it was less advanced and potentially easier to treat, a recent study suggests.    Researchers examined data on 1.7 million adults under age 65, of all income levels, who were newly diagnosed with cancer between 2011 and 2014. About 907,000 participants lived in states that expanded Medicaid, the government-sponsored insurance for the poor, under the ACA. Another 811,000 people lived in states that didn’t expand Medicaid.   The effect of expanded Medicaid was most pronounced for low-income patients. Before the ACA took effect, in the states that subsequently added to their Medicaid rolls, 9.6 percent of low-income people newly diagnosed with cancer were uninsured. Afterward, only 3.6 percent of poor, newly diagnosed cancer patients lacked health coverage in these states.    The decline in the proportion of newly diagnosed patients without insurance was much less pronounced in states that didn’t expand Medicaid. In these states, the proportion of low-income newly diagnosed cancer patients without insurance dropped from 14.7 percent before the ACA to 13.3 percent afterward.   In Medicaid expansion states, there was also a small but statistically meaningful increase in the proportion of patients newly diagnosed with colorectal, lung, breast, pancreatic and melanoma cases that were caught when tumors were in the early stages of development.   “Although the increase in the percent of patients diagnosed with early-stage diseases in Medicaid expansion states is small, it has significant clinical implications,” said lead study author Ahmedin Jemal, vice president of surveillance and health services research at the American Cancer Society in Atlanta.   “Patients diagnosed with early-stage diseases are more likely to be treated successfully and to be cured and to have better quality of care,” Jemal said by email. “Furthermore, the increase in detection of cancers at early stage has societal implications by avoiding premature deaths when individuals are in the workforce, raising children and supporting other family members.”   These results suggest a need for additional expansion of access to care, especially for low-income populations, the authors conclude in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.    To assess the impact of the ACA and the expansion of Medicaid programs, researchers examined data from the National Cancer Data Base.    For a picture of what happened before the ACA took effect at the beginning of 2014, they looked at data from 2011 through the third quarter of 2013. To see what happened afterward, they examined data from the second to fourth quarter of 2014    They looked at changes in insurance and in early-stage diagnosis for 15 leading cancers in men and women.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that the ACA or Medicaid expansion directly caused more low-income people to be diagnosed with cancer sooner. The study also didn’t follow people to determine if this resulted in better survival odds or other benefits.    Researchers also didn’t follow people beyond the first year of Medicaid expansions. Previous research has found that coverage gains, access to care and health benefits of expanding Medicaid increase over time, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health policy and economics researcher at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.   “However, coverage expansion on its own may not necessarily lead to more early stage cancer (diagnoses), especially cancers for which we don’t have effective screening tests,” Sommers, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   And it’s too soon to expect to see dramatic changes in survival rates, said Dr. Ernest Hawk of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.   “Nevertheless, the reduction in the number of newly diagnosed cancer patients in conjunction with the downward stage-shift documented in this study is a promising step towards helping to address the disparities in cancer outcomes, including survival,” Hawk, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

2f9lfBd,2017-09-14,Dental work tied to heart infections in people with artificial valves," (Reuters Health) - Invasive dental procedures may raise the risk of rare but serious infections in people who have prosthetic heart valves, a recent French study suggests.    Some previous research has linked dental work to an increased risk of what’s known as infective endocarditis - infections of the heart valve or lining - in people with prosthetic valves, but results have been mixed and inconclusive about whether antibiotics would prevent these infections.    For the current study, researchers examined data on 138,876 adults with prosthetic heart valves, roughly half of whom had at least one dental procedure during the study period. About 26 percent of the dental work involved invasive procedures, and patients received antibiotics in only half of these cases.    Patients who had invasive dental procedures were 66 percent more likely to develop these infections than people who didn’t have invasive dental work, researchers report in The BMJ.    “Although the risk of infective endocarditis is low it is reasonable to offer the option of antibiotic preventive strategy prior to dental procedures because it is life threatening,” said lead study author Sarah Tubiana of INSERM in Paris.    “Invasive dental procedures such as tooth extraction or scaling disrupt gingival integrity and allow bacteria in the mouth to enter the bloodstream; then, the bacteria can graft on cardiac valves and destroys valves,” Tubiana said by email.    Infective endocarditis is a rare but severe disease that kills one in five people hospitalized for the condition and has a five-year mortality rate of 40 percent, researchers note.    Researchers followed half of the people in the current study for at least 1.7 years and during that time, 267 individuals developed endocarditis associated with streptococcus bacteria that live in the mouth.    The study team looked at endocarditis rates in the three-months after invasive dental work and compared infection rates to what happened to individuals who didn’t have invasive dental procedures.    During the three months after invasive dental work, 5.1 percent of patients developed endocarditis, compared with 3.2 percent during periods without dental procedures.    Among people who had invasive dental procedures, the endocarditis rate was lower for those who got antibiotics at the time, but the difference was too small to rule out the possibility it was due to chance.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that dental work directly causes endocarditis or that antibiotics might prevent these infections.    Indeed, the authors note that while dental procedures were linked to slightly higher rates of these heart infections, they are not the main source of risk for heart valve patients, since the majority of infections across the entire study population occurred in people who didn’t have recent dental work.    “Dental procedures are only one cause of infective endocarditis, and bacteria can get into the bloodstream simply during the course of daily life - for example through chewing or tooth brushing,” said Dr. Tom Cahill, co-author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at Oxford Heart Centre in the UK.    “The most important thing is that patients with valve disease are aware of endocarditis, and seek urgent medical attention if they are worried they have developed any of the symptoms,” Cahill said by email.    Symptoms can be similar to the flu and include fever, sweats, chills and aching muscles or joints, he said. Some people with these infections may also have swollen glands, headache, cough, fluid buildup on the chest or legs or breathlessness.   "
2eWH9ne,2017-09-14,"Brief, intense exercise may keep breast cancer at bay"," (Reuters Health) - Exercise has long been linked to better outcomes for women with breast cancer, and a recent study might explain why.   Brief exercise that’s intense enough to get your heart rate elevated and make you breathe heavily activates molecular pathways in the body that boost chemicals called catecholamines, such as epinephrine, which suppressed the growth of breast cancer cells, researchers from Denmark found.   “It is important to highlight that exercise training and epinephrine did not completely prevent tumor formation, but induced a 50 percent reduction,” senior study author Pernille Hojman from University of Copenhagen told Reuters Health. “Thus, exercise training can never replace anti-cancer therapy, but could be an effective supportive strategy, which in addition to the biological effects, also has been shown to increase the patients’ quality of life and sense of empowerment.”    Plenty of population studies have shown that exercise can reduce a woman’s risk of breast cancer and, in women who already have breast cancer, may keep it from coming back. Few studies have examined how this works.    Hojman’s team used experimental mice implanted with human breast cancer tumors as well as tumor cells in test tubes to investigate how serum samples collected from healthy women and breast cancer patients before and after exercise affect the development of the breast tumor cells, and what mechanisms were involved.    They found that serum samples taken after exercise reduced the ability of tumor cells to grow in test tubes or in mice. Only 45 percent of mice with tumors steeped in post-exercise serum developed tumors, compared with 90 percent of mice with tumors not exposed to post-exercise serum or exposed to pre-exercise serum.    The researchers traced this anti-tumor activity to a rise in epinephrine and norepinephrine that occurs with moderately intense exercise and its effect on the a gene-signaling pathway known as Hippo that, among other things, helps to suppress tumor development.    This effect emerged only with serum samples taken after 15 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity exercise, according to the report in Cancer Research, and it was not related to the serum-donor’s body weight, blood sugar levels or immune responses.    “In our study, we found that breast cancer patients in adjuvant chemotherapy, were indeed capable of performing the required exercise, so it is feasible for cancer patients to do the exercise training we are proposing,” Hojman noted in an email interview.    “Our identified mechanism of an epinephrine-driven regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway during exercise could certainly also be envisioned to work in other types of cancer,” she said.   "
2gPJIfb,2017-09-14,Happy music linked to creative thinking," (Reuters Health) - Listening to happy music while working may spark the kind of divergent thinking that’s associated with creativity and problem solving, a recent study in the Netherlands suggests.   In particular, classical music that ranks highly for positive and energetic qualities, such as pieces composed by Antonio Vivaldi, were most likely to encourage creative thinking, researchers found.   “Creativity is one of the core skills needed for dealing with a world that is changing faster than ever before,” said study coauthor Sam Ferguson of the University of Technology in Sydney, Australia.    “Knowledge about ways to facilitate this important skill is becoming more critical,” he told Reuters Health by email.   Ferguson and Simone Ritter of Radboud University Nijmegen played classical music for 155 Radboud student volunteers as they completed a creativity task. The researchers split the students into five groups, with each group randomly assigned to listen to one of four pieces of music or to silence before and during their creativity tasks.   The music pieces were chosen for their mood and arousal levels. The Swan by Camille Saint-Saens represented a positive mood but low arousal level, thus a calm piece of music. Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons was the happy piece, Adagio for Strings by Samuel Barber was the sad, slow piece and The Planets: Mars, Bringer of War by Gustav Holst was used as a negative, arousing - in other words, anxious - piece.    To test creativity, the research team focused mainly on divergent thinking, which involves producing multiple answers from available information by making unexpected combinations, recognizing associations among ideas and transforming information into unexpected forms. Divergent thinking is key to today’s scientific, technological and cultural fields because innovation often pairs disparate ideas, the authors write in PLoS ONE.    “One thing to point out is that divergent thinking is not equivalent to creative thinking, but it’s a proxy measure often used in research,” said Rex Jung of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, who wasn’t involved with the study.    Ferguson and Ritter asked participants to list as many different and creative uses for a common object as possible, in this case, a brick. They also tested convergent thinking, which measures whether someone can come up with the best, well-established or correct answer to a problem when the answer already exists.   Answers were then scored by the number, quality, creativity, originality and usefulness of the ideas. The students were also asked about their moods before the test began, as well as how much they liked the music.    The research team found that the students’ moods before the test didn’t seem to make a difference in their creativity in the task. It also didn’t matter how much they liked the music or how familiar they were with the music.    Overall, the type of music did not make a significant difference in performance on the creativity test, compared to silence, with the exception of happy music. Happy music also appeared to make the most difference in divergent thinking but not in convergent thinking.   “Music is such an important part of everyday life, and it could be a potential avenue for fostering creativity in education and the workplace,” Jung told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “Even if people don’t play it themselves, they can appreciate it.”   The small number of participants and the fact that most were women are limitations of the study, Jung added. Factors such as gender, age, education level and socioeconomic status could influence how music affects creative thinking.   Future studies should further investigate how familiarity with and enjoyment of music affects creativity as well, the study authors write.    Inherent skill and aptitude are also important to study in relation to creativity, Jung noted. He and others are researching how visual, spatial and musical abilities intersect with creativity.   “If you have perfect pitch or tonal rhythm, are you more likely to be creative and more likely to pursue a creative field?” he asked. “And which abilities are most important to STEM careers in science, technology, engineering and math?”   Jung tells his patients that listening to music for creativity is similar to taking medication for depression. “Medication can set the tone in your brain to do the hard work you have to do when talking to your therapist. Similarly, putting on music won’t make you more creative, but it can set the stage to help you.”  "
2wXGJ8y,2017-09-12,Extended breastfeeding may help ward off endometriosis," (Reuters Health) - Women who nurse their babies are less likely to develop endometriosis, and the longer they breastfeed, the lower their risk, a new study shows.                    FILE PHOTO: Mothers breastfeed their babies while attending a rally to raise public awareness and support for breastfeeding near the steps of New York City Hall in Manhattan, August 8, 2014. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz      “For women who are interested in reducing their risk for endometriosis, breastfeeding is one potential modifiable way that women can reduce their risk,” Dr. Leslie V. Farland of Harvard Medical School in Boston, one of the study’s authors, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “I think the research builds off of what we already know, that breastfeeding can be beneficial for both mother and child.”   About 10 percent of women in the U.S. have endometriosis, in which tissue that lines the uterus is also found growing outside the womb, usually in the pelvic area. Endometriosis causes chronic pain and can lead to fertility problems. There is no cure. Treatments include pain medication, hormone therapy, surgery to remove the misplaced uterine tissue and in some cases total hysterectomy.   Some researchers have proposed that that retrograde menstruation, in which menstrual blood “backs up” through the uterus into the fallopian tubes and out into the abdomen, could eventually lead to endometriosis. Because many women stop menstruating while they are breastfeeding, being exposed to fewer periods could thus have a protective effect.   Dr. Farland and her team looked at 72,394 women participating in the Nurses’ Health Study who had been pregnant for at least six months. None had endometriosis at the beginning of the study.   During follow-up, 3,296 were diagnosed with endometriosis. Women who had breastfed for at least three years during their reproductive years were 40 percent less likely to develop endometriosis than those who breastfed for less than a month. On a per-pregnancy basis, each additional three months of nursing was associated with an 8 percent lower endometriosis risk.   Women who stopped menstruating for six to 12 months after their baby’s birth were 42 percent less likely to develop endometriosis than those who never missed a period after pregnancy.   But exposure to fewer menstrual periods accounted for only some of the protective effect of breastfeeding. Dr. Farland and her colleagues suggest that the hormonal changes women experience during breastfeeding, including higher oxytocin levels and lower estrogen levels, could also play a role.   “Our results aren’t generalizable to women who have endometriosis before pregnancy,” Dr. Farland said. Future studies should investigate whether breastfeeding could reduce symptoms in these women, she added, and clarify the mechanism responsible for breastfeeding’s protective effect.  "
2wVrqgo,2017-09-11,Child injuries in ATVs dropped after age-restriction law," (Reuters Health) - Restricting use of off-road vehicles, including all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), for younger children and teens may help curb the number of youth who get seriously injured in crashes, a U.S. study suggests.   Researchers examined data on youth who received emergency treatment for injuries in off-road vehicles (ORV) in Massachusetts before and after a 2010 state law banning kids under 14 from riding without adult supervision and requiring older teens to take driving classes.    Emergency room visit rates for kids age 10 to 13 with ORV injuries fell by half in the three years after the law took effect, compared with the nine years before, the study found. Emergency room visits also dropped by 33 percent for children age 9 and under, and by 39 percent for teens 14 to 17.    “Our study brings renewed hope that legislation, when done well, can be another tool to help save children’s lives when it comes to off-road vehicles designed for adults,” said lead study author Dr. Michael Flaherty of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.    The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents not let children under 16 ride off-road vehicles both because their bodies may lack muscle strength and coordination and to drive safely and because they may not have the maturity and impulse control to make smart decisions behind the wheel.    Massachusetts passed “Sean’s Law” in 2010 in honor of 8-year-old Sean Kearney, who died when an ATV he was riding overturned on him.     In addition to restricting use by children under 14, the legislation also limited the types of vehicles kids could ride, required the vehicles to be registered with the state and increased penalties for adults who let kids ride unsupervised.    There were 3,638 emergency department discharges and 481 inpatient discharges of children who suffered injuries related to off-road vehicles during the study period, from 2002 to 2013.    Overall, inpatient discharges declined by 41 percent for kids 17 and under after the state ORV law took effect, researchers report in Pediatrics.    Among teens 14 to 17 years old, injury rates dropped to about 32 for every 100,000 people after the law took effect from about 52 per 100,000 before.    For kids 13 and under, injury rates dropped to about 8 for every 100,000 people from 12 per 100,000 before the law took effect.   There wasn’t a significant drop in emergency discharges for older riders, ages 25 to 34, after the law restricting use by children and teens took effect, the study also found. Injury rates for these older riders remained stable at about 30 for every 100,000 people.    While the study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that age restrictions directly caused a drop in child injuries, the absence of a meaningful shift in discharges for older riders suggests the state law had the intended effect and protected kids, the authors conclude.    Researchers also lacked data on how much time kids spent as riders or passengers on off-road vehicles, making it impossible to determine how usage rates might have influenced injury rates.    The safest choice for parents is to keep kids away from these vehicles altogether, said David Schwebel, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the study.    But if children are going to ride, there are safety precautions that can minimize the injury risk, Schwebel said by email.    “Helmets reduce the risk of injury, but they do not prevent all injuries,” Schwebel said.   “Driving more slowly helps, so giving kids less powerful vehicles will reduce injury risk,” Schwebel added. “Children should also never drive on public highways, as handling traffic adds substantial complexity and risk.”  "
2wWgvTW,2017-09-11,Even `metabolically healthy’ obese people have higher heart disease risk," (Reuters Health) - People who are considered metabolically healthy may still have a higher risk of developing heart problems if they are obese than they would if they weighed less, a recent study suggests.    Obesity on its own is a risk factor for heart disease. The study focused on the odds of heart problems for people at various weights who were considered metabolically healthy because they didn’t have three other risk factors for heart disease: diabetes, high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol.    Metabolically healthy obese people were 49 percent more likely to develop cardiovascular disease and almost twice as likely to develop heart failure as normal-weight people without any metabolic abnormalities, the study found.    “Although those `metabolically healthy’ obese people may not have those risk factors we described – diabetes and high blood pressure and blood fats – being obese is already a metabolic abnormality,” said  senior study author Neil Thomas of the University of Birmingham in the UK.   “There is no such thing as `metabolically healthy’ and obese,” Thomas said by email.    Globally, 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese, according to the World Health Organization. Obesity increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, joint disorders and certain cancers.    For the study, researchers focused on one commonly used measure of obesity known as body-mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height.    A BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered healthy, 25 to 29.9 is overweight, 30 or above is obese. Anyone with a BMI below 18.5 is considered underweight.   An adult who is 5’ 9” (175 cm) tall and weighs from 125 lbs (57 kg) to 168 pounds (76 kg) would have a healthy weight and a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An obese adult at that height would weigh at least 203 pounds (92 kg) and have a BMI of 30 or more.   For the current study, researchers examined data on 3.5 million adults who were at least initially free of heart disease.    Overall, about 3 percent of these people were underweight without any metabolic abnormalities, 38 percent were metabolically healthy and at a normal weight, and 26 percent were overweight without metabolic issues. Another 15 percent were metabolically healthy and obese.    Metabolic problems were rare, regardless of people’s weight.    But like obese people in the study, individuals who were not obese but who were overweight without metabolic abnormalities still had a higher risk of heart disease than people who were metabolically healthy and also at a healthy weight, researchers report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.    Individuals who were underweight and without metabolic abnormalities had a higher risk of vascular disease than people who were a normal weight, the study also found. This might be at least partially explained by smoking, which can mean people are slimmer but also that they have a higher risk of vascular problems, the authors note.   One limitation of the study is that BMI doesn’t distinguish between weight from fat versus lean muscle mass, making it possible that at least some people classified as obese in the study were actually unusually muscular rather than fat, the authors also point out. The study might also include people who had undiagnosed risk factors for cardiovascular disease.    People should not base their understanding of their own health and fitness on BMI alone, said Jennifer Bea, a researcher at the University of Arizona in Tucson and author of an accompanying editorial.    “You can have a normal BMI, but low muscle tone and low bone mass, thus by default, a high percentage of fat,” Bea said by email. “Even normal weight individuals based on BMI can have metabolic dysfunction and be at risk.”  "
2wUGGu3,2017-09-11,Eating in synch with your body clock may help curb fat gain," (Reuters Health) - Timing meals relative to your own body clock, rather than to the time of day, may affect how lean you are, researchers suggest.    Studies have shown that eating later in the day ups your risk of weight gain. However, the impact of a person’s body (biological) clock - independent of the time of day - has not been tested until now, according to Dr. Andrew McHill of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and colleagues.   “Our findings could be considered a reason not to eat right before going to sleep, but they’re also a reason not to eat later in the evening, even if you are planning to go to bed at a later time,” McHill told Reuters Health by email.   The team recruited 110 college students ages 18 to 22 (about 60 percent male) for a 30-day study of sleep times and food intake.    The students completed questionnaires about their sleep habits at the outset of the study, as well as daily electronic sleep-wake and exercise diaries. They also wore motion monitors throughout the study to help track sleep-wake timing.   For one week during the study, participants used a mobile phone app to time-stamp, document and record their food intake during their regular routines.    They were also evaluated for one night at the hospital to see what time their level of the hormone melatonin began to rise - which marks the beginning of a person’s biological night - and to assess their body composition (i.e., muscle mass and fat).   Melatonin onset timing was similar for both lean participants and those with a higher percentage of body fat, according to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition study, online September 6.   However, those with a higher percentage of body fat - 8.7 percent higher in women and 10.1 percent higher in men - ate most of their calories about an hour closer to the time of melatonin onset than did lean participants.   There was no relationship between body composition and when (clock hour) they ate, how many calories they consumed, what kind of food they had, their exercise or activity level or sleep duration.   “While it’s not possible to know the timing of your melatonin onset without having it measured very precisely in dim lighting, we tend to think that melatonin levels rise about two hours prior to habitual sleep onset,” McHill explained.   What about waking up and eating a snack in the middle of the night?    “This would also be a time when melatonin is high and your body clock is promoting sleep and fasting,” he said, “so we would consider that a time that food consumption could lead to higher body fat if done repeatedly over a long period of time.”     McHill cautioned that the findings don’t show cause and effect. To do that, he said, “randomized controlled trials that include altering the timing of meals of the exact same food content in relation to melatonin timing (e.g., providing meals within four hours of melatonin onset or restricting calories to when melatonin concentrations are low) are needed.”    It’s also important to study groups other than college students, and the team has already begun to track meal timing in older and ill populations.   Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, a nutritional epidemiologist at Harvard Chan School of Public Health in Boston who was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health he agrees that “the takeaway is that eating earlier before bed may be better” - perhaps as much as 4 to 5 hours earlier.    However, “actual experiments to show direct long-term weight loss and health benefits from consistently eating earlier before bed are needed,” he added by email.   “Be vigilant of your food intake as time to sleep approaches,” Dr. Jocelyn Cheng, a neurologist at NYU Langone Health in New York City urged in an email to Reuters Health.    “If you notice yourself eating more during this period compared to earlier in the day, consider redistributing your meals, snacks included,” said Cheng, who was not involved in the study.

2etqCuK,2017-09-11,Doctors who take pharmaceutical money use Twitter to hype drugs," (Reuters Health) - Some cancer doctors use Twitter to promote drugs manufactured by companies that pay them, but they almost never disclose their conflicts of interest on the social media platform, a new study shows.   “This is a big problem,” said senior author Dr. Vinay Prasad, a professor at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. “Doctors are directly telling patients about their views on drugs, and financial conflict plays a role. But they’re not telling patients they have a conflict.”   Prasad and his colleagues analyzed the tweets and income of blood cancer specialists who posted regularly on Twitter and received at least $1,000 from drug manufacturers in 2014.    Of the 156 hematologist-oncologists in the study, 81 percent mentioned at least one drug from a company that gave them money, and 52 percent of their tweets mentioned the conflicted drugs, according to a study reported in a letter in The Lancet.   Only two of the doctors disclosed that they received payments from the drug companies whose products they mentioned on Twitter.   Cancer drugs tend to be toxic, produce debilitating side effects and are frequently only marginally effective, Prasad said in a phone interview.    Pharmaceutical companies routinely pay doctors to assess their products and to speak at conferences and seminars.    Bioethicist Susannah Rose, who was not involved with the study, said it “yet again shows the complex issues related to physicians’ financial relationships with industry.”   She urged disclosure, possibly in physicians’ Twitter profiles, about conflicts of interests.    Rose, who is scientific director of research for the Cleveland Clinic’s office of patient experience in Ohio and was not involved in the study, suggested in email to Reuters Health that doctors should use a common abbreviation in their tweets to indicate conflicts of interest.   Celebrities use the hashtag #sponsored when they tweet about products from companies that pay them, Prasad said.    “Maybe we can learn something from the celebrities here,” he said.    Genevieve P. Kanter, a professor of research at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, said she was surprised that hardly any of the studied doctors disclosed their payments from drug companies.   “If a doctor is promoting a drug - whether it’s at a presentation, at a conference, through an op-ed or via a tweet - the audience should be informed of possible biases that might come from being financially supported by the company producing that drug,” she said in an email.   Doctors, consciously or unconsciously, may be “shading their speech or their actions because of their dependence on certain income sources,” said Kanter, who was not involved in the study.    Rose advises patients to ask their doctors about possible conflicts of interest. In the U.S., patients can look up physicians’ relationships with drug manufacturers on a government website:  bit.ly/2wVGWsS.    Kanter suggested that patients who learn their doctors have conflicts of interest consider getting a second opinion.   Prasad began thinking about conflicts of interest in tweets a few years ago, when he got into a Twitter dispute about whether physicians should engage in a debate over drug costs.    As the argument heated up, Prasad divided the dueling doctors into two camps - those in favor of discussing the price of drugs and those opposed. Then he looked up which ones took money from drug companies.   Of five physicians who argued that doctors should advocate for lower drug costs, only one had taken money from a drug company, and it was a single $400 payment. The five who argued that doctors should stay out of the discussion of drug prices had taken payments of between $20,000 and $30,000, Prasad said.    Earlier this year, Prasad published his first study on tweeting doctors. Nearly 80 percent of more than 600 U.S. hematologist-oncologists who tweeted had a conflict, his report in JAMA Internal Medicine found.   Doctors should disclose possible conflicts in their Twitter profile biographies, possibly with a link to more complete disclosure, Prasad and his colleagues wrote in the earlier study.

2xbXnTR,2017-09-08,DACA tied to better mental health for children of immigrants," (Reuters Health) - Protecting young undocumented immigrants known as “dreamers” from deportation may also help lower the risk of mental health problems for their U.S.-born children, a recent study suggests.    The Trump administration this week announced plans to revoke the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allowed about 800,000 undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children to remain in the country.    For the study, researchers examined data on 5,653 mothers in Oregon born just before and after the cutoff for DACA eligibility. To qualify they had to have entered the U.S. before they turned 16, no earlier than June 15, 1981.   When mothers qualified for DACA, 3.3 percent of their children had a range of mental illnesses that can be provoked by stress such as intense feelings of sadness or hopelessness, anxiety and depression.    But when mothers weren’t eligible for DACA, 7.8 percent of their kids had these mental illnesses.    “Mental illness in early childhood can have serious downstream effects,” said lead study author Jens Hainmueller, co-director of the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University in California.    “It can impair school performance and cause health issues such as substance abuse, obesity or cardiovascular diseases,” Hainmueller said by email. “So the costs for individuals, as well as society at large, are likely to be vast.”   About 4 million children born in the U.S. have at least one parent who is an unauthorized immigrant, researchers note in the journal Science.    To assess how fear of a parent’s deportation might influence mental health, researchers examined data on 8,610 children born to undocumented mothers in Oregon between 2003 and 2015.    The mothers had pregnancy coverage through Oregon’s Emergency Medicaid program, which pays for care provided to immigrant women who do not qualify for traditional Medicaid. The children, as U.S. citizens, were then covered by Medicaid, so researchers could see whether health records revealed a mental illness.     Researchers focused on mental health disorders that might develop in children afraid of being separated from their parents by deportation. This included what’s known as adjustment disorder, which is often triggered by a stressful life event and can result in poor performance in school or work, behavior problems, sleep difficulties, depression, anxiety, substance abuse and suicidal thoughts.    The 4.5 percentage point drop in the proportion of children diagnosed with adjustment or anxiety disorders during the post-DACA period “provides evidence that mothers’ DACA eligibility sharply improved their children’s mental health,” the authors write.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that DACA directly caused an improvement in kids’ mental health.    It also only looked at one state and might not reflect what would happen elsewhere in the U.S., the authors note.    At least some of the mental health benefits associated with DACA in the study might be explained by other factors such as increased stability and socioeconomic status, noted Dr. Bukola Salami of the University of Alberta.   “It is well known that parents’ social status has implications for child health and well being,” Salami, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Immigration status is a social determinant of health, although this has not been largely recognized by health and immigration policy makers.”   The study results offer fresh evidence of the potential for deportation, or living with the fear of deportation, to have serious consequences, said Claire Brindis, co-director of the Adolescent and Young Adult Health National Resource Center at the University of California, San Francisco.   “Without their parents, many of these children may end up in the foster care system, facing a myriad of problems, or if raised by other family members they may be living in circumstances with less financial support,” Brindis, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   There’s already extensive evidence that separating children from their parents is a severe stressor for children, and the study adds to the evidence that this would hold true for families impacted by ending DACA, said Dr. Schuyler Henderson, a psychiatry researcher at Bellevue Hospital in New York.    “If you are interested in protecting American children, you need to protect their parents, wherever they are born,” Henderson, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

2wlwbzB,2017-09-07,ACA marketplace plans offer limited access to mental health care," Reuters Health - So-called narrow-network insurance plans created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) offer only limited access to mental health care, a recent U.S. study suggests.    Narrow-network plans, which generally limit coverage to less than 25 percent of health care providers in a given market, were designed to offer lower-cost options for people buying insurance through ACA marketplaces, researchers note in the journal Health Affairs.    But the tradeoff for lower costs may be less access to mental health care - a breach of both the ACA and federal laws requiring parity between coverage for mental health and other types of care.    Overall, narrow network plans included just 24 percent of all primary care providers and only 11 percent of all mental health providers practicing in state marketplaces, the study found.    “The ACA doesn’t specify what constitutes a plan that’s too narrow,” said lead study author Dr. Jane Zhu of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia.    “And a concern is that a plan that’s too narrow might exclude behavioral health specialists or push people out-of-network, which is associated with higher out-of-pocket costs and may reduce access to care,” Zhu said by email.    For the study, researchers examined data on 531 unique provider networks in the ACA marketplaces in 2016.    Overall, only 43 percent of psychiatrists and just 19 percent of non-physician mental health care providers participated in ACA narrow-network plans, the study found.    The ACA and an earlier law, the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, aim to make insurance coverage for mental health care as easy to obtain as coverage for physical ailments, researchers note.   The ACA mandates, for example, that all marketplace plans offer coverage for mental health care including treatment for substance abuse.    One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on what’s known as behavioral health carve-out plans, which use specialized management firms to provide mental health care separately from physical health care benefits, researchers note. This might mean the study underestimated the number of mental health care providers available to patients in narrow-network plans.    Some of the difference in participation between primary care providers and mental health providers might also reflect a shift in the medical profession that has seen fewer people pursue behavioral health and more individuals choose careers in primary care and family or internal medicine.    In addition, past research has found that both psychiatrists and non-physician mental health care providers face reimbursements for time-intensive care, like talk therapy, that are far lower than their usual rates, so they have incentive to avoid participating in insurance networks, the authors note.    The study also didn’t look at access to social workers, who represent a large proportion of the mental health care workforce.    Even so, the findings highlight a barrier to achieving similar access to both physical and mental health care, the authors conclude.    Before the ACA, less than half of people in the U.S. suffering from mental illness received any care at all, said Benjamin Le Cook, a researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.    “With the advent of the ACA marketplace, many patients and families that need mental health care have new opportunities for finding affordable insurance that they did not have pre-ACA,” Cook said by email.    “However, this study shows that these families and patients need to shop (for) insurance plans carefully on both price and availability of mental health providers,” Cook added. “It may be worth it to them to pay a higher premium to get a mental health provider that can provide the best treatment for them or their family member.”  "
2xRBgA9,2017-09-07,More evidence links exercise to lower stroke risk," Reuters Health) - Women who consistently get the minimum recommended amount of exercise for a healthy heart may be less likely to have a stroke than their counterparts whose exercise habits shift over time, a recent U.S. study suggests.                     FILE PHOTO: A woman jogs along the levee in the Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood one day before the ten year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, August 28, 2015. REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman      Researchers examined data on more than 61,000 women in the California Teachers Study who reported their exercise habits at two points in time, once from 1995 to 1996 and again from 2005 to 2006. The women were current and retired teachers when the study began.    Overall, 987 women had a stroke by the end of the study period.    But the women who got at least 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity exercise at both points in time were 30 percent less likely to have what’s known as an ischemic stroke, the most common kind, which occurs when a clot blocks an artery carrying blood to the brain.    “How people exercise changes over time and some individuals exercise when they are a young adult but do not keep it up when they are older,” said lead study author Dr. Joshua Willey of Columbia University Medical Center in New York.    “In our study, we found that maintaining exercise levels was protective against stroke, and that taking up exercise when not being active while younger was also protective,” Willey said by email. “Similarly, those who no longer exercised on the follow up assessment did not have a lower risk of stroke.”   The American Heart Association recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise or at least 75 minutes of more vigorous physical activity.    More than 22,000 women met these minimum recommendations at both points when they were assessed in the study, mostly with moderate exercise.    Almost 19,000 women failed to get enough exercise at either point in time.    Another 11,500 women fell short of this goal in the beginning but achieved it at the end, while about 8,600 women started out getting enough exercise but failed to do so by the end of the study.    Compared to women who failed to meet exercise recommendations at either point in time, women who got enough moderate activity at both points were 38 percent less likely to have a fatal stroke and 12 percent less likely to have any kind of stroke, the study found.     Meeting moderate exercise guidelines by the end of the study, but not at the start, was associated with 35 percent lower odds of a fatal stroke and 27 percent lower odds of any stroke.    But the chance of any stroke, including fatal ones, was similar for women who never got enough exercise and women who started out meeting the activity recommendations but didn’t do so at the end of the study, researchers report in the journal Stroke.    The results were similar for women who did higher-intensity exercise.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how exercise habits might influence the odds of having a stroke or dying from it.    Other limitations include the lack of data on other factors that could influence stroke risk such as blood pressure, obesity or diabetes, the authors note.    Even so, the findings add to growing evidence for the benefits of moderate exercise, said Joe Northey of the University of Canberra in Australia.    “Moderate intensity seems to be optimal for increasing blood flow to the brain,” Northey, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Increasing cerebral blood flow through exercise improves the health and function of the brain.”   Enjoyment, rather than intensity, should be the focus, said Dr. James Burke, of the University of Michigan and the Ann Arbor VA.    “The best exercise is the one a person enjoys doing because he/she is more likely to make it a habit,” Burke, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Inactivity, meanwhile, can take a toll on health, said Sandra Billinger of Kansas University Medical Center in Kansas City.    “When we don’t exercise, our blood vessels become more stiff, we tend to gain weight, our lungs are not well used and our muscles become weak and lose size,” Billinger, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

2xbrImw,2017-09-06,Drug may slow early lung disease damage," Reuters Health - Most people in the earliest stages of the breath-robbing condition known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have no symptoms, so they have no idea that their lungs are deteriorating rapidly.   A new study from China suggests that if COPD can be detected early, the drug tiotropium might be able to slow that deterioration if used in conjunction with standard inhaler therapy.   In 388 volunteers with the mildest forms of the disease who were treated with tiotropium, lung capacity declined by an average of 38 mL per year, compared with a 53-mL decline among 383 placebo recipients, researchers reported in The New England Journal of Medicine.   Such people usually are given no medicine because they have no symptoms or few symptoms. Tiotropium, sold under the brand name Spiriva, costs about $13 per day for a standard dose, or roughly $4,700 per year. Boehringer Ingelheim, the manufacturer of the drug, paid for the study.   The findings need to be confirmed, but if they are, it could finally give doctors a treatment for the disease to delay late symptoms, Dr. MeiLan Han, a spokeswoman for the American Lung Association, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.   “We know that lung function decline is probably greatest in the earlier stages,” said Dr. Han, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Michigan. “What makes this study unique is it studied the mildest group that has ever been studied, the patients most likely to benefit, and the researchers actually showed a benefit.”   Just over 6 percent of the U.S. population has been diagnosed with COPD, which manifests itself as difficulty breathing, cough, and other symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vast majority are smokers or former smokers, but one quarter of its victims have never smoked.   “About half of the patients who have the disease are undiagnozed, yet it’s the third leading cause of death in the United States,” said Dr. Han, who was not connected with the research.   Doctors have not been more aggressive at diagnosing COPD because, until now, no treatment has been shown to be helpful in the early stages.   One of the coauthors, Dr. Pixin Ran of the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases, told Reuters Health by email that 87% of patients with the earliest stage of COPD were still in stage 1 after 24 months, versus 76% in the placebo group.   “Once the diagnosis of COPD is confirmed,” Dr. Ran said, “avoidance of the risk factors (e.g., smoking cessation) is imperative.”   Long-term use of the drug would be necessary, but “maintenance therapy with medications such as tiotropium is reminiscent of the strategy for management of patients with diabetes and hypertension,” he said.   But Dr. Ran also said, “Further study is needed for the development of less costly drugs that can help to improve lung function, slow down the decline in lung function, improve quality of life, and decrease the incidence of exacerbations among patients with early-stage COPD.”   When the drug was tested on people with more-severe COPD in a 2007 study known as UPLIFT, it didn’t produce significant improvement in lung capacity. But there was a suggestion that it might help patients with moderate stage 2 disease.    “This is potentially game-changing,” said Dr. Han of the Lung Association. “So instead of ignoring these people, the onus is getting them diagnosed because if the study is correct there’s something we can do about it. It could lead us in a whole new direction.”  "
2eLCAzU,2017-09-06,What should doctors and nurses do when a shooter is in the hospital?," Reuters Health - Many healthcare workers think an active shooter could one day be in their hospital - and most of them believe doctors and nurses have a special obligation to protect patients even if it means endangering themselves, a recent study suggests.    Researchers surveyed 1,017 members of the public and 684 health professionals. Overall, 18 percent of the public and 33 percent of health professionals said they thought the odds of a shooter in a hospital were high or very high.    In the surveys, conducted in March, both groups - members of the public and health professionals - identified hospitals as lower-risk venues than other places like shopping centers, airports or schools.    “The public’s belief that hospitals are at lower risk might be grounded in the perception of hospitals as sanctuaries of caring and healing,” study co-authors Dr. Lenworth Jacobs and Karyl Burns of Hartford Hospital in Connecticut write in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons.    “Although the risk of such events might be low, hospitals can be attractive targets because of the presence of pharmaceuticals, narcotics, radioactive materials, sensitive information and controversial research activities,” Lenworth and Burns write.    Slightly more than 60 percent of the public and health workers thought doctors and nurses had a special duty to protect patients, similar to the obligations of first responders like firefighters or police, the study found.    Thirty-nine percent of the public and 27 percent of health professionals thought doctors and nurses should take on a high degree of personal risk to help patients in an active shooter situation.    Health workers were more apt to take on a high degree of personal risk for the most vulnerable patients. For example, 45 percent of health professionals thought they should intervene even in the face of high personal risk to protect patients in the operating room, and 36 percent thought this should apply to patients in intensive care units. However, just 22 percent of health workers believed they had this obligation for patients who are ambulatory, and potentially more able to flee the scene or protect themselves.    Seventy-six percent of the public and 92 percent of health professionals thought doctors and nurses should have a personal choice about whether to try to save patients’ lives in an active shooter situation.    “If we are asking healthcare providers to enter an active shooter scene . . . while the shooting is still going on, I would not expect a healthcare provider to try to deal with that until the assailant is either gone or otherwise dealt with,” said Dr. Peter Pons of Denver Health Medical Center and the University of Colorado School of Medicine.    “I do think, however, that when there is an active shooter situation in a hospital, staff should do what they can to ensure that patients in areas not involved in the shooting scene are appropriately protected and managed, whether that includes sheltering and barricading in place or evacuating,” Pons, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Gunshot wounds can cause severe bleeding, damage to organs and tissues, and infections, with worse complications the longer victims wait for treatment.    The new survey findings come amid a push by doctors and emergency responders to reduce deaths in mass shootings and disasters by teaching strangers and bystanders to step in and control victims’ bleeding before emergency medical service (EMS) workers arrive.   Even without formal training, people can help a bleeding patient by calling 911, getting a first aid kit or applying direct pressure over the wound, said Jonathan Epstein, senior director of science and content development for the American Red Cross.   “Severe bleeding can be a life-threatening condition,” Epstein, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “It can lead to significant injury or death in a matter of a few minutes.”   The Red Cross offers a free first aid app here:  rdcrss.org/2eMgk9c  and information on first aid classes here:  rdcrss.org/2eLUDGd.

2eLmOF8,2017-09-06,Discussing cancer costs can reduce treatment expenses," (Reuters Health) - Even brief conversations between oncologists and patients about cancer costs can help reduce treatment expenses, a new study suggests.   “Increasingly in oncology there are many therapeutic options and they all differ slightly from one another. Where there is a huge difference, a doctor is going to recommend the best one that is the best hope for the patient. When there is a small difference and the big issue is cost, I think it’s relevant to discuss it with patients since they are going to bear some financial burden,” said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).    “I am hopeful that as doctors read about studies like this they realize that it’s feasible to discuss cost in patient encounters,” said Schilsky, who was not involved in the research.   Researchers analyzed 677 transcripts of conversations taped in 2010-2013, between 56 oncologists in private practice clinics across the country and patients with breast cancer. Most patients were 55 to 74 years old and insured.    Cost came up in only 147 conversations, or 22 percent. When it did come up, oncologists were the ones who raised it 59 percent of the time, the research team reported in the Journal of Oncology Practice.    Half of the discussions lasted only about 33 seconds. But even though the discussions were brief, they were substantive enough to lead to helpful and creative solutions for patients in most cases, said lead author Dr. Wynn Hunter of the Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina.    After these conversations, oncologists switched patients to lower-cost medications, ordered different diagnostic tests, changed the dose or frequency of medication, facilitated copay assistance, gave patients free samples or changed the logistics of intervention by, for example, rescheduling tests before the patient had to pay a new deductible.   Hunter told Reuters by phone, “Finances have to be a part of the equation when we think about the therapies that we give. One part of the Hippocratic Oath is that we do no harm to patients. If we just treat disease and two or three years later it causes financial hardship and marital strife, then it’s not necessarily a victory.”    In 2009, ASCO recommended that physicians discuss the costs of cancer treatment with patients, because they can become a tremendous financial burden. One-third of working-age cancer survivors go into debt, and 3 percent of patients go bankrupt from cancer care costs.    “This study is encouraging because it documents real doctor-patient encounters that were meaningful and demonstrated that doctors are knowledgeable about how to identify alternatives for patients that are less costly,” Schilsky said in a telephone interview.   Hunter told Reuters Health, “It used to be taboo to talk about finances in the clinic and no one was doing it. This study proves it’s happening more frequently than people thought, and it can be done in a way that’s non-confrontational and non-biased. It can be as simple as asking a patient if they are having any difficulties obtaining their medications.”    Patients also need to be empowered to bring up costs with their oncologist, Hunter emphasized.   In the study, Caucasian patients initiated cost conversations 12 percent of the time while African American patients had these conversations 3 percent of the time.   One of the limitations of the study is that it analyzed cost discussions only for patients with breast cancer. It’s not clear if patients with other cancers engage in similar discussions.     Schilsky said, “One of the challenges is we don’t understand if it’s necessary, appropriate or feasible to have had discussions in all 677 encounters. Sometimes patients have an acute medical problem, and we have to be focused on that. Sometimes there isn’t an issue of cost for the patient. We don’t know what the denominator is in a sense. Is it likely these discussions could be held more frequently? Almost for sure,” he said. “But there are many nuances to this.”   Schilsky warned that one discussion of costs is often insufficient. Multiple discussions with multiple levels of a patient’s health care team are usually needed.   "
2eI0A6R,2017-09-05,Vaginal estrogen not tied to cancer or heart disease risks," (Reuters Health) - Using vaginally applied estrogen to ease menopause symptoms likely doesn’t increase a woman’s risk of heart disease or certain cancers, a U.S. study suggests.    Many women have been reluctant to use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause symptoms since 2002, when the federally funded Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study linked pills containing man-made versions of the female hormones estrogen and progestin to an increased risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes. Some women have also been reluctant to use vaginally applied estrogens, which can ease symptoms like dryness and painful intercourse.    For the current study, researchers examined data on 45,663 women in the WHI study who didn’t take HRT pills. After an average follow-up of more than six years, there wasn’t a meaningful difference in the odds of cancer, stroke or blood clots based on whether or not women used vaginal estrogen.    “The results of the study suggest that the use of vaginal estrogen may not actually carry the same health risks as the use of estrogen pills,” said lead study author Dr. Carolyn Crandall of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles.   “These results are reassuring,” Crandall said by email.    Women go through menopause when they stop menstruating, typically between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from irregular periods and vaginal dryness to mood swings and insomnia.   Study participants who used vaginal estrogen were less likely to be black or African-American, Hispanic, current smokers, diabetic or obese. They were also more likely to be white and college graduates with household income of more than $100,000 a year.    Compared with women who didn’t use vaginal estrogen, women who did had a 48 percent lower risk of heart disease and 60 percent lower odds of hip fractures, researchers report in Menopause.    When researchers looked just at women who still had a uterus, the results looked even more favorable for vaginal estrogen users.    Among women who had not had their uterus removed, vaginal estrogen users were 61 percent less likely to have heart disease, and 60 percent less likely to have a hip fracture than women who didn’t use vaginal estrogen.     The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how vaginal estrogen might influence the odds of heart disease, cancer or other health problems.    Another limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on different types of vaginal estrogen, so they couldn’t tell whether one form might be best for avoiding cancer or heart disease.    Even so, the findings should reassure women, said Dr. Michelle Warren, medical director of the Center for Menopause, Hormonal Disorders and Women’s Health in New York City.    “This shows that it is perfectly safe for any woman to take low-dose vaginal estrogen,” Warren, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Some women who have avoided vaginal estrogen because they thought it was just as risky as pills may now be able to get relief for previously untreated menopause symptoms, said Dr. Michael Thomas of the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center in Ohio.    “A study like this allows women to safely use a form of estrogen that will help their (vaginal) symptoms,” Thomas, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “They can have intercourse without pain and feel safe they are not risking their life.”  "
2eHWxYj,2017-09-05,Mobile apps for diabetes patients need careful review," Reuters Health - Diabetes patients who use smartphone applications to manage their condition should know that not all apps are reliable, researchers say.    “We have more than 165,000 health and fitness apps in app stores right now and little control over what’s being published,” said study author Francois Modave of the University of Florida in Gainesville.   “App manufacturers want to produce good information, but there’s no oversight from any health organization or agency,” Modave told Reuters Health by phone.    Approximately 29 million Americans have diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.    Modave and colleagues used the Mobile App Rating Scale to analyze and rank the top free apps for diabetes management. They also looked at the number of diabetes-specific management tasks that the apps included, such as physical activity, nutrition, blood glucose testing, medication and insulin dosage, health feedback, and education.    In June 2016, the researchers identified 120 free patient apps for Android and Apple devices and evaluated 89 that were in English and didn’t require subscriptions. Overall, the apps scored high on aesthetics and engagement but poorly on information and quality. Only four of the 89 apps integrated the six diabetes management tasks, and fewer than half the apps integrated four tasks.   The top free apps, according to the researchers, were Tactio Health: My Connected Health Logbook for iOS devices and American Association of Diabetes Educators Diabetes Goal Tracker for Android devices. The Accu-Chek 360 Diabetes Management for Android was also a top app but has been discontinued; in its place is a new program (which the researchers didn’t analyze) called Accu-Chek Connect.   “In the clinic, patients sometimes forget to bring their meter, but they always have their phone,” said Helen Fu of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, who studies patients’ use of diabetes apps but who wasn’t involved in Modave’s research.    Another advantage of phones over glucose meters is that “meter reports often come out as PDFs, which you can’t track or search well in an electronic health record,” she told Reuters Health by phone.   Dr. Nana Hempler of the Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen in Denmark, who has also studied apps for diabetics but wasn’t involved with this study, told Reuters Health by phone, “Patients also want to know about their mood, stress, sleep problems and well-being, which aren’t very common in most diabetes apps.”    Dr. Sarah Bigi of Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Milan, Italy, who wasn’t involved with this study, is testing a new messaging app for patients with diabetes at two hospitals in Italy.    “We’re interested in how verbal communication can enhance self-management,” Bigi told Reuters Health by email. “I think we have to devote major consideration to this aspect when we assess mobile technology.”   Lead study author Sarah Chavez of the University of Florida told Reuters Health that health care providers who work with diabetes patients should stay informed about the top apps in app stores.   “See what’s out there,” she advises. “Know what your patients are looking at and make sure they’re searching for the right ones.”  "
2wJuE9s,2017-09-04,Heart benefit of alcohol not seen in people with liver disease," (Reuters Health) - Light to moderate drinkers may have a lower risk of heart disease than teetotalers, but a new study suggests this doesn’t hold true for people with fatty liver disease.   Most people have a little bit of fat in their liver, but fatty liver disease can be diagnosed when more than 5 percent of the liver by weight is made up of fat. If the condition isn’t linked to liver damage from heavy drinking, it’s known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is most often associated with obesity and certain eating habits.    For the current study, researchers examined data on 5,115 adults aged 18 to 30, following them for up to 25 years to assess their drinking habits and check for evidence of fatty liver disease, heart disease or risk factors for cardiac problems.    “Heart disease is actually the leading cause of death in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease so it is important to investigate possible dietary and lifestyle factors that might help prevent complications of heart disease,” said lead study author Dr. Lisa VanWagner of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.    “We failed to find any association between moderate alcohol use and multiple different markers of heart disease and heart disease risks, including blood pressure, cholesterol or calcium deposits in the arteries of the heart,” VanWagner said by email.    To look for a connection between alcohol use and heart disease, researchers focused on 2,479 participants who remained in the study for 25 years and didn’t already have a history of heart attack or heart failure, alcohol-related liver damage or other issues like being too obese to fit in CT scanners for liver imaging.    In the final analysis, 570 participants, or 23 percent had NAFLD, researchers report in Gastroenterology.    Roughly 58 percent of the people with NAFLD were light or moderate drinkers, while the rest said they didn’t drink at all.    Drinking in moderation was defined as an average of one or two drinks a day for men and one a day for women, VanWagner said.    Drinkers were more likely to be white, male and have more education than nondrinkers. People who used alcohol were also more likely to be obese and have diabetes.    But there wasn’t any difference in heart disease or risk factors for heart disease based on whether people with NAFLD abstained or drank moderately.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how alcohol use might influence heart health in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.    It’s also possible at least some of the study participants weren’t truthful about their drinking habits when they were surveyed, and some might have downplayed their alcohol use or actually had alcoholic fatty liver disease, the authors note.    “Alcohol abuse is a well known risk factor for liver disease, up to cirrhosis and end stage liver damage,” said Dr. Valerio Nobili of University La Sapienza and Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome, Italy.    It’s also possible that the study didn’t find a protective effect from alcohol for people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease because of other factors such as how much exercise people got or what they ate, Nobili, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “Today it’s very well known that moderate alcohol use compared to abstinence is associated with lower mortality in the general population, decreasing the incidence of coronary heart disease, diabetes and ischemic stroke,” Nobili said. “What isn’t clear is whether that is also true in people affected by nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.”  "
2wo6GO7,2017-09-04,"Wealthier people exercise more on weekends, sit more during the week"," (Reuters Health) - People with higher incomes tend to be “weekend warriors,” who are sedentary much of the time but exercise a lot on their days off, a recent U.S. study suggests.    Plenty of previous research has linked affluence to a higher likelihood of intense physical activity and more time devoted to exercise compared to people with lower incomes. But these findings have typically relied on individuals to report on their own workout habits, a notoriously unreliable measure of physical activity, researchers note in the journal Preventive Medicine.    For the current study, researchers examined income and activity data for 5,206 adults who were asked to wear accelerometers to track their movements during waking hours for one week.    Compared to people making less than $20,000 a year, individuals earning at least $75,000 annually were 1.6 times more likely to meet physical activity guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous workout during a two-day period. Over the entire week, the more-affluent people were 1.9 times as likely to meet the guidelines.    “Meeting physical activity guidelines is important for longevity, improved quality of life, mental and cognitive health and chronic disease prevention including type 2 diabetes and some cancers,” said lead study author Kerem Shuval, director of physical activity and nutrition research at the American Cancer Society in Atlanta.    In one respect, lower-income individuals in the study came out ahead. They tended to spend less time overall sitting or standing still than their more affluent counterparts.   “Although lower income individuals are less likely to meet physical activity guidelines, they are less sedentary and engage in more light activity,” Shuval said by email. “To improve our health, we should strive to sit less, move more and attempt to incorporate exercise into our weekly routines.”   High-income individuals engaged in 9.3 fewer minutes of light intensity activity during a typical day and spent 11.8 more minutes sedentary, the study found.   The more-affluent study participants also spent 4.6 more minutes a day on average doing moderate or vigorous exercise.    This adds up to more than 30 minutes more exercise in a week, enough to make a meaningful difference in health, Shuval said.    While the study focused on a large, nationally representative sample of adults, it wasn’t designed to prove whether or how activity levels and sedentary time influence health.   It’s possible that income levels contributed to different patterns in activity levels and sedentary time because of the types of jobs people had, with more-affluent individuals more tethered to desks, the researchers note.    Lower-income people might have gotten more light activity during the week because they did more housework or were on their feet more at their jobs. It’s also possible that richer people worked out more outside of their jobs because they could afford gym memberships.    Wearing the accelerometers might also have changed participants’ exercise habits, producing results that don’t reflect what people really do in a typical week, the authors note.    Regardless of what job people have or how much they earn, there may still be ways to get more exercise and reduce sedentary time, said Hannah Arem, a researcher at the Milken Institute for Public Health at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Strategies to increase physical activity outside of the gym include taking the stairs instead of an elevator and parking farther away or getting off a bus a stop early and walking in cities, through bike share programs and increasing walking and biking infrastructure,” Arem said by email.    “Some studies have shown that active commuting is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.”  "
2xywfw6,2017-09-04,Leg injury risk goes up in previously injured athletes," (Reuters Health) - Athletes may be more likely to suffer leg injuries when they’ve had injuries in the past - even those involving other parts of the body, a recent study suggests.    It’s well known that athletes often re-injure the same part of their body more than once, researchers note in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. But their new study shows that physical therapy and injury prevention efforts need to take into account the risk other injuries pose for subsequent leg injuries.   The researchers examined data from 12 previously published studies and found many types of previous injuries, including concussions, were associated with higher odds of a lower limb injury.    “When we are injured we generally only focus on the body part that is being rehabilitated, yet it is just as important to keep the non-injured parts of your body healthy and injury free,” said lead study author Liam Toohey of La Trobe University in Bundoora, Australia, and the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra.   When athletes miss components of their normal training regimens due to injury, they may have a reduced fitness level and be in less than top condition when they resume participation in practices or competitions, Toohey said by email.    “During rehabilitation, it is common for the injured body site to be strengthened and conditioned, but often other body sites are not trained as much as they were before the injury,” Toohey added. “So when an athlete is ready to return to full training and competition, the other areas of their body may not be as conditioned as they need (to be) to withstand the demands of the sport - where they may then go on to sustain an injury at a different site.”   For example, one of the most common knee injuries, an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) sprain or tear, was associated with a more than doubled risk of a subsequent hamstring injury, Toohey and colleagues found.    A previous muscle injury in the hamstrings, quadriceps, adductors and calves was tied to higher odds of a muscle injury in a different part of the lower limb, the study also found.    Back injuries were also connected to an increased risk of leg injuries in the future, as was a history of concussion and a variety of joint injuries.   One limitation of the analysis is that it examined data from only a small number of previously published studies, the authors note. It’s also possible that other things such as the intensity or duration of play, nutrition, or psychological factors might influence the odds of lower limb injuries, the authors note.    Even so, the findings add to evidence suggesting that injured athletes need to consider the potential for future injuries, said Lauren Fortington of the Australian Centre for Research into Injury in Sport and its Prevention in Ballarat.    “Many research studies to date have focused on recurrent injuries of exactly the same type, for example a right ankle sprain followed by another right ankle sprain,” Fortington, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “The problem is greater than that - previous injury of any type may increase the risk for lower limb injuries.”   To minimize the risk of leg injuries in the future, rehabilitation of other injuries must account for what parts of the body carry most of the load in an athlete’s particular sport, said Isabel Moore, a sports and health sciences researcher at Cardiff Metropolitan University in the UK.    Psychological factors also need to be addressed, Moore, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   “Stress, anxiety and fear of re-injury are all known to influence the chances of sustaining an injury,” Moore said.   "
2xAUppO,2017-09-01,More older men get prostate radiation when doctors own the equipment," (Reuters Health) - Elderly men with prostate cancer are more likely to be treated with radiation when their doctors own radiation machines - even patients who may be too old to benefit from the treatment, a U.S. study suggests.   Prostate cancers may grow too slowly to cause symptoms before an elderly man dies from other causes. Doctors can therefore opt to forego screening or treating some older men to spare them unnecessary procedures with side effects like impotence and incontinence.    For the current study, researchers examined data on more than 31,000 men aged 65 and older who were newly diagnosed with prostate cancer. The researchers were looking to see how often patients received radiation even when they had little risk of dying from tumors over the next decade, and high odds of dying from some other cause.    They looked, for example, at men with prostate cancer who had at least a 75 percent chance of dying from something other than cancer within 10 years. Doctors in practices that owned radiation equipment treated 53 percent of these men, whereas physicians without the financial incentive of owning the equipment treated 44 percent of these cases.    Researchers also looked at what’s known as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), a newer computer-guided form of radiation that’s designed to target tumors while sparing surrounding tissue.    When doctors had an ownership stake in IMRT, 42 percent of men with a high chance of dying from something other than cancer received this treatment, compared to 26 percent of men when physicians didn’t own IMRT machines.    “Patients should be aware that financial incentives of their provider can influence how they are treated for their prostate cancer,” said lead study author Dr. Brent Hollenbeck of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.   “Urologists in some single-specialty groups with an ownership interest in IMRT were more likely to treat, and even overtreat, patients with IMRT than urologists affiliated with a multispecialty practice or a group without an ownership stake,” Hollenbeck said by email.    Among men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer, use of IMRT ranged from 24 percent in multispecialty groups to 37 percent in large urology groups, the study team reports in European Urology.    Patients managed in groups with IMRT ownership were more likely to receive IMRT than those managed by single-specialty groups without ownership regardless of the size of the group practice, the researchers also found.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that financial incentives influence treatment decisions, the authors note.    Even so, the findings suggest it may make sense for men to seek a second opinion, doctors say.    “For men diagnosed with prostate cancer, if doctors are not spending the time to understand your individual hopes and concerns about rates of cure, toxicity and impact on quality of life and tailor their recommendations based on those discussions, then you should seek the counsel and care of another doctor,” Dr. Justin Bekelman, a prostate cancer specialist at University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia, who wasn’t involved in the study, sad by email.    To get the care that’s right for their specific circumstances and preferences, patients need to think about more than just whether doctors have financial ties to radiation equipment, said Dr. Lih-Ming Wong of St Vincent’s Hospital and the University of Melbourne in Australia.    “It is not unreasonable to ask about any financial conflict of interest,” Wong, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    But patients should also ask what would happen if they opted for observation instead of treatment and what treatment alternatives they can consider if they don’t do IMRT, Wong added.    “Like all professions there will be a range in the way individuals within it practice,” he said. “It is not as simple as avoiding a group practice that owns their IMRT equipment.”  "
2xAyn6F,2017-08-31,Quick ‘mindfulness’ fix may help curb drinking," (Reuters Health) - Heavy drinkers may be able to cut back after brief mindfulness training exercises that involve helping them focus on what’s happening in the present moment, a small experiment in the UK suggests.                     A drinker pours Saigon beers into a cup at a restaurant in Hanoi, Vietnam May 27, 2015.  REUTERS/Kham       Researchers recruited 68 heavy drinkers who weren’t alcoholics for the test. They randomly assigned participants to receive either a training session in relaxation strategies or an 11-minute training session in mindfulness techniques to help them recognize cravings without acting on them.    Over the next week, people who received mindfulness training drank significantly less than they had during the week before the study started, but people in the relaxation group did not drink significantly less.    “Our study was not a clinical trial and did not involve ‘treating’ people who needed help cutting down their alcohol use,” said study co-author Dr. Damla Irez of University College London.    “But it did suggest that people who drink too much, but don’t have an alcohol use disorder, might be able to reduce their consumption, at least in the short term, by practicing mindfulness,” Irez said by email.    During the mindfulness training, people were told to pay attention to cravings instead of suppressing them. They were told that by noticing bodily sensations, they could tolerate them as temporary events without needing to act on them.   Relaxation training, meanwhile, told people that softening the muscles, calming and unwinding the mind and releasing tension in the body can reduce the intensity of cravings.    After receiving one of these trainings, participants were encouraged to practice the techniques they learned over the next week.    Right after training, both groups reported reduced cravings for a drink, though the decline was greater in the relaxation group, researchers report in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology.   However, people in the mindfulness group consumed 9.3 fewer units of alcohol, roughly the equivalent of three pints of beer, in the week after training than they did in the week before the study started. In the relaxation group, people consumed 3 fewer units of alcohol – a difference too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    Beyond its small size, another limitation of the study is that the researchers relied on participants to accurately recall and report how much alcohol they consumed and whether they had been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. The study was also too brief to determine how much training people might require to make a lasting impact on their drinking habits.   “It is new and surprising that such a brief training would have an impact on behavior,” said Dr. William Marchand, a psychiatry professor at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “We would have thought significantly more training would be needed to change behavior,” Marchand said by email. “What we don’t know is if there will be a lasting impact on drinking behavior.”   Still, the first step to target addictive behaviors is to become aware of them, said Stefan Hofmann, a psychology researcher at Boston University who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Humans tend to establish habits and link behaviors to situational cues,” Hofmann said by email.    For drinkers, this might mean that being around certain people or in certain places, such as a bar, might make drinking more likely, Hofmann said.    Ordering another round of drinks can become automatic in these circumstances, but becoming aware of the cues that lead to heavier drinking can help change how people respond to these cues.    “This is why mindfulness can be a very powerful strategy,” Hofmann said. “It breaks reflexive behaviors by making us more reflective.”  "
2wT9O7X,2017-08-30,Earlier drinking by teens linked to earlier sex," (Reuters Health) - Teens who start drinking at younger ages are more likely to have their first sexual encounter earlier than others, according to a new study.   Although the pattern held true for both genders, the effects were more pronounced for younger females.   “Adolescents who engage in early sex have higher risks for sexually transmitted infections or unplanned pregnancies,” lead study author Dr. Kelly Ann Doran of Indiana University in Bloomington told Reuters Health by phone. “Although the U.S. has seen a drop in pregnancy rates, we still have one of the highest in the Western industrialized world. It’s a big issue, and it’s important to find the risk factors that lead to risky sex.”   Doran and colleagues analyzed survey data from 4,079 males and 4,059 females who participated in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997. Data collection started when participants were between ages 12 and 16, and it continued periodically until they were 25 to 31 years old.    On average, boys and girls both had their first drinks before their 15th birthday. The average age for first sexual encounter was 16 for both genders, the study authors wrote in the Journal of Adolescent Health.    Onset of drinking before age 14 more than doubled the odds that adolescents of either gender would have earlier sexual encounters. For females who had their first drink at 13 or younger, the likelihood of early sexual initiation quadrupled.   “The association is strong for both males and females,” Doran said. “It still holds (regardless of) socioeconomic status or poor parental monitoring, which could mean we see a unique risk with early drinking.”   “With research, we sometimes think about all of these different risks as separate and have separate programs for alcohol use or teen pregnancy, but many of these behaviors are interconnected,” said Dr. Arielle Deutsch of Sanford Research in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Deutsch, who wasn’t involved with this study, has researched the link between substance use and sexual intercourse among teens. [   “We have to really think about all of these behaviors and what adolescents may be going through during this time in their lives,” she told Reuters Health by phone.   Future studies should look at the reasons why early drinking may be linked to earlier sex, such as lowered inhibitions, impaired decision-making, and peer pressure among social groups, Doran said.   “Impairment from alcohol increases the likelihood of being victimized or victimizing other people,” she said. “We’d like to do more research to see if there is any difference for voluntary or involuntary sex as well.”   The emotional and social context around the first-time sex experience is important, too, Deutsch added.   “It’s about the relationship between two people and how individuals think about what they’re doing,” she said. “How do teens think about planning their first sexual experience?”   “When teens talk about things like drinking, sex, hanging out with their friends, and partying, it’s all interconnected, especially with parenting approaches,” Deutsch said. “We should be talking to teens about how to make good choices overall and have the experiences they want in life.”  "
2wT1Prq,2017-08-30,Meth use boosts young adults’ risk for brain bleeds and stroke," (Reuters Health) - Young adults who use the stimulant methamphetamine, sometimes called `speed,’ `ice,’ or `meth,’ may have an increased risk of strokes, a recent study suggests.    Previous research in animals and humans has tied meth abuse to a variety of potentially fatal cardiovascular problems including heart failure, as well as damage to blood vessels in the brain, stroke, high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat.    “Methamphetamine users and their communities should be aware that stroke can occur in young people within hours or days of use, and also as a long-term consequence,” said lead study author Dr. Julia Lappin of the University of New South Wales in Australia.    “A key feature to look out for is the sudden development of a headache, which is often extreme,” Lappin said by email. “Other signs include confusion, numbness or loss of function down one side of the body, and problems with speech and vision.”   For the current study, researchers reviewed results from 77 previously published reports of strokes associated with meth and found that most are what’s known as hemorrhagic strokes, a less common type that is caused by a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.    More often, strokes are caused by clots in the arteries that carry blood to the brain. So-called ischemic strokes can strike at any age but are far more common in the elderly.    Lappin’s team focused on strokes in people under age 45.    Altogether, the studies in the current analysis included 81 hemorrhagic strokes and 17 ischemic strokes, the researchers report in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.   Both types of stroke were roughly twice as common in men as in women.    Eighty percent of strokes associated with the use of methamphetamine were hemorrhagic strokes.    Hemorrhagic strokes typically account for only 40 percent to 50 percent of strokes in people under the age of 45 and just 15 percent to 20 percent of strokes in older people, researchers note.    In one third of the cases, hemorrhagic stroke was associated with vascular abnormalities, such as high blood pressure and inflamed blood vessels, the study found. Repeated use of methamphetamine can drive up blood pressure even in those whose blood pressure is normal to start with, the study authors point out.   The risk of death was higher after a hemorrhagic stroke: one in four people recovered completely, but one in three died. This compares with complete recovery for one in five meth users and death in one in five after an ischemic stroke.   The study looked largely at individual cases of strokes, so it didn’t offer fresh evidence on rates of stroke among methamphetamine users.     While the study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how methamphetamine causes strokes, it’s possible that spikes in blood pressure associated with the drug may make users more susceptible to stroke, Lappin said.    Methamphetamine use can also make blood vessel walls weak and more prone to rupture.    The results suggest that as methamphetamine use becomes more common worldwide, it will also become a growing cause of stroke in young adults, said Dr. Stephan Schurer of the University of Leipzig in Germany.   “Stopping the abuse and more efforts in the prevention of abuse could prevent fatal consequences,” Schurer, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Quitting may help lower the stroke risk, but the long-term impact of methamphetamine abuse still isn’t clear, doctors say.    “The risk for stroke will almost certainly go down with abstinence,” said Dr. James Januzzi of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.    “While it is hard to predict a longer term risk, given short term benefits from a heart and brain perspective, the faster a person can avoid use of methamphetamine, the better,” Januzzi, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

2wTg67x,2017-08-30,Flame retardants linked to infertility in women," (Reuters Health) - Women with high concentrations of common flame retardants in their urine may have a hard time getting pregnant and carrying a baby to term, a recent study suggests.    The chemicals - known as PFRs, or organophosphate flame retardants - can be used to make clothing or upholstery fire-resistant and may also be found in nail polish, yoga mats and car seats.    For the study, researchers examined data on 211 women who went to a fertility clinic in Massachusetts to be evaluated for in vitro fertilization. Lab tests showed high urinary levels of metabolites, or byproducts, of three flame retardants: diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) and isopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate (ip-PPP).   Compared to women with the lowest levels of two of these chemicals - DPHP and ip-PPP - in their urine, women with the highest levels were 10 percent less likely to have a successful fertilization, 31 percent less likely to have an embryo implant in the uterus, 41 percent less likely to have a viable pregnancy, and 38 percent less likely to have a live birth.    “These findings suggest that exposure to PFRs may be one of many risk factors for lower reproductive success,” said lead study author Courtney Carignan, who did the research at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.    “They also add to the body of evidence indicating a need to reduce the use of these flame retardants and identify safer alternatives,” Carignan, now at the Center for Research on Ingredient Safety at Michigan State University in East Lansing, said by email.    Flame retardants added to a wide range of products aren’t chemically bound, which means they’re continuously released into the air and dust, Carignan said.    “We all ingest a little bit of dust every day because small amounts easily stick to our hands,” Carignan added. “Couples wishing to reduce their exposure to flame retardants may benefit from washing their hands several times throughout the day, particularly before eating, as previous studies have shown that people who wash their hands more frequently have lower levels of these chemicals in their bodies.”   One in six couples struggles with infertility - a proportion likely to rise as increasing numbers of people in developed countries delay childbearing, researchers note in Environmental Health Perspectives.    Previous studies have linked exposure to products containing hormone-disrupting chemicals, such as pesticides and phthalates, to infertility and poorer reproductive success. PFRs have been found to cause hormone disruption in animal studies.    In the current study, 87 percent of the women had BDCIPP in their urine, 94 percent had DPHP and 80 percent had ip-PPP. Just 14 percent had the flame retardant tert-butylphenyl phenyl phosphate (tp-PPP), and none had bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BCIPP).    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how flame retardants might impact women’s fertility.    Another limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t consider male partners’ exposure to flame retardants, the authors note. Because the study participants were 35 years old on average and seeking care at a fertility clinic, it’s possible the results might not reflect what would happen for younger women or all women trying to conceive.    “Since this is the first study to examine the effects of organophosphate flame retardants on female reproduction, it is unclear how these findings would apply to the general population of reproductive-aged women,” said Ami Zota, an environmental and occupational health researcher at the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University.    While more research is needed to confirm the study findings in a larger population, women may still take precautions, Zota, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “Women may be able to reduce their chemical exposures in the indoor environment by washing their hands frequently, especially prior to eating, as well as buying flame-retardant-free furniture,” Zota advised.   "
2xMYjve,2017-08-30,Lack of REM sleep tied to increased risk of dementia," (Reuters Health) - People who spend less time in deep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep may be more likely to develop dementia than individuals who get better quality rest, a recent study suggests.    Patients with dementia often have difficulty sleeping, but previous research has offered a mixed picture of which comes first – the cognitive decline or the sleep deficit.    For the current study, researchers examined data from overnight sleep studies for 321 adults age 60 or older who didn’t have dementia. After an average follow-up of 12 years, 32 people developed dementia.    Each percentage reduction in the time people spent in REM sleep was associated with a 9 percent increase in the risk of dementia, researchers report in Neurology.    “We observe an association between sleep and dementia but cannot determine whether reduced REM causes dementia,” said lead study author Matthew Pase of Swinburne University in Australia.   “It is unclear whether increasing REM sleep reduces dementia risk,” Pase, who did the research as part of the Framingham Heart Study at Boston University, said by email. “However, good quality sleep is clearly important for overall health and well-being and the emerging picture suggests that sleep and dementia may influence each other.”   Overall, study participants spent about 20 percent of their sleeping time in REM sleep, the sleep analysis found. But the subset of people who went on to develop dementia spent only 17 percent of their sleep time in REM sleep.   Out of all the dementia cases found in the current study, 25 percent occurred within the first 6.6 years of follow-up. The total included 24 instances of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia.    Reduced REM was associated with similar increases in the risk of both Alzheimer’s and other dementia cases.    Researchers also looked at what’s known as sleep latency, or how long it takes to fall asleep, and didn’t find this related to the risk of developing dementia.    The study is small, and the results would need to be confirmed by more research in larger groups of people, said Dr. Eric Larson, vice president for research at Kaiser Permanente Washington and a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle.    But that doesn’t mean people should ignore the importance of REM sleep.    “REM sleep is considered the part of the sleep cycle where our brains get rejuvenated,” Larson, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “It’s considered the best part of sleep from a perspective of gaining the rest that restores well-being.”   Other research has linked both insomnia and a nighttime breathing disorder known as sleep apnea with an increased risk of dementia, noted Dr. Kristine Yaffe, a psychiatry and neurology researcher at the University of California, San Francisco who wasn’t involved in the study.    “This adds to the growing science that sleep health or quality is related to brain health,” Yaffe said by email. “It is important to tell your doctor about concerns about your sleep and follow good sleep hygiene practices.”  "
2vHdSCZ,2017-08-30,Cancer patients lack access to fertility support,"  (The story refiles to change source name from Donald to Don in paragraph 2, in the August 29th instance.)   By Cheryl Platzman Weinstock   (Reuters Health) - Up to half of cancer patients of reproductive age do not receive adequate information about the impact of treatment on their fertility, decreasing their options for family planning and support, a new study suggests.    “When we look at studies of regret after cancer treatment one area that is always mentioned is reproductive regrets. Women come back and say they never got the chance to discuss their fertility and now it is gone,” Dr. Don Dizon, clinical co-director of gynecologic oncology at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, told Reuters Health.    “My hope is that this study reinforces the importance of bringing up fertility to all patients of reproductive age regardless of prognosis,” said Dizon, who wasn’t involved in the research.    For the new analysis, Dr. Shanna Logan at Kids Cancer Center, Sydney Children’s Hospital in Australia and colleagues examined data from 23 previous studies conducted in seven countries from 2007 to 2016.   Across the studies, the likelihood that health care providers and patients discussed fertility issues depended on the provider’s specialty, the patient’s gender and age, and the provider’s attitude and knowledge of fertility preservation techniques.    In one study included in the review, 93 percent of clinicians said they routinely discuss fertility issues with their patients, but medical records showed that only 74 percent actually did so.    In another study, clinical nurse specialists discussed with patients the possibility that treatment could adversely affect fertility 68 percent of the time, while only 40 percent of surgeons reported being involved in such discussions.    Fewer than half of clinicians said they referred patients to a reproductive specialist when patients had fertility concerns. One study found that only 61 percent of clinicians were aware of an established referral pathway to a fertility clinic.   Cancer and cancer treatment either temporarily or permanently affects the fertility potential of 50 to 75 percent of cancer survivors. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends that healthcare providers discuss as early as possible the risk of infertility and fertility preservation options with all post-pubescent patients who will undergo cancer treatment.   Logan told Reuters Health by email that young female patients reported greater barriers to receiving appropriate oncofertility support than male patients.    Sperm banking is more often easily available than female preservation techniques, she noted.    “At times patients report that clinicians felt embarrassed having these conversations or did not place great importance on the topic of fertility,” Logan said.   She emphasized that patients want both verbal and written information related to their age and tumor type.   Logan believes oncofertility support is not uniform because clinicians don’t all have the same up-to-date information about resources available.   Dizon agrees. In a telephone interview, he said oncologists don’t get trained in reproductive methods so they’re not the ones to explain them.    “I wish I could say I was shocked that oncofertility support is not offered routinely, but I’m not,” Dizon added.    Oncologists who aren’t comfortable with these discussions should refer patients to other experts, he said. But outside large medical centers, he noted, these services may not be widely available.   Dr. Pasquale Patrizio, director of the Yale Fertility Center and Fertility Preservation Program in New Haven, Connecticut, told Reuters Health by phone, “We are making good progress in having patients be referred to a reproductive endocrinologist in a timely manner, but we still have a lot of work to do.”   Fertility preservation must not compromise the patient’s chance for a cure, Patrizio said. He only needs 10 days to plan a fertility preservation strategy like collecting or retrieving eggs. When a patient needs to begin treatment immediately, ovarian tissue can be cryopreserved in 48 hours.   Logan said, “Providing oncofertility care at the time of diagnosis and through till survivorship is integral in reducing later psychological distress and lowered quality of life seen in cancer survivors with impaired fertility.”  "
2wGQ9Yc,2017-08-29,Religious young women less educated about HPV vaccine," (Reuters Health) - Religious young women are less knowledgeable about a vaccine that guards against several different types of cancer, suggests a new study from Utah.   Compared to women who didn’t practice a religion, those who did were nearly 60 percent less likely to know about the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and about half as likely to have received at least one dose, researchers found.   “One thing you might expect is that they might be less likely to receive the vaccine or they may perceive themselves as having less risk,” said senior author Deanna Kepka, of the University of Utah’s Huntsman Cancer Institute and College of Nursing in Salt Lake City. “I wouldn’t expect them to be less informed about the vaccine.”   HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The infection usually resolves on its own without causing health problems, but it can lead to cancer and genital warts if it doesn’t clear up.   HPV infections can cause cervical, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, throat and other cancers.   The CDC currently recommends that boys and girls between ages 11 and 12 get two doses of HPV vaccine. The second dose is given 6 to 12 months after the first shot.   “Compared to other states, Utah has very low HPV vaccination rates, and we know that we are one of the more religious states,” Kepka told Reuters Health.   In 2013, the researchers recruited female patients at the University of Utah Community Clinic, ages 18 to 26, and asked them to complete surveys by mail.   Overall, they had survey responses from 148 women who practiced an organized religion and 178 women who weren’t religious.   About 97 percent of non-religious women had heard of HPV, compared to about 90 percent of religious women.   Similarly, religious women were less likely than their non-religious peers to have heard of the vaccine, to know how HPV is spread and to have their healthcare provider recommend the shots.   “This study is showing that women weren’t even making the informed choice,” said Kepka.   About 50 percent of the religious women said they had received at least one dose of the vaccine, compared to about 73 percent of non-religious women, the researchers reported in PLOS ONE.   About 36 percent of religious women were fully vaccinated against HPV, compared to about 60 percent of non-religious women.   A number of explanations could account for the differences between religious and non-religious women’s knowledge and receipt of the vaccine, said Kepka.   Doctors may make judgments about their patients’ social circles and interests, for example.   Kepka said the pattern is likely similar cross the country.   “We all need to get onboard . . . focus on the facts and integrate (the HPV vaccine) as a part of our healthcare system,” said Kepka.  "
2vGXuCR,2017-08-29,Steady may win the weight-loss race," (Reuters Health) - Dieters who lose varying amounts of weight each week may not shed as many excess pounds as people who consistently lose the same amount week in and week out, a U.S. study suggests.    Researchers examined data on183 overweight and obese adults who participated in a weight loss program with meal replacements provided along with goals for calorie monitoring and exercise.    After two years, the dieters who had the most consistent weight loss during the first three months of the program shed more excess pounds than the people who initially had more fluctuation, researchers report in the journal Obesity.    While the study can’t explain whether or how consistency in weekly weight loss might contribute to success, it’s possible that different approaches to dieting played a role, said study co-author Michael Lowe, a psychology researcher at Drexel University in Philadelphia.    “Those who lose weight steadily may have had more consistent eating and exercise habits before they joined our program and continued with that pattern as they cut back on calories and exercised more,” Lowe said by email.    “Those with more variable patters may be trying to lose weight as quickly as possible - so they sometimes have big weight losses, but this leaves them starving and unable to stay on their diet for a week or so,” Lowe added. “They regain some of their weight, get upset, and try to lose as much as they can again.”   At the start of the study, participants were 51 years old on average and typically obese. The majority were white, and most were women.    Overall, participants’ weekly weight loss tended to vary by about 1.09 pounds during the first six weeks and by 1.33 pounds during the first 12 weeks of the study.    Women tended to be more consistent dieters than men, with less variation from one week to the next at both six weeks and 12 weeks.     The researchers found that higher weight variability during the initial six and 12 weeks of weight loss treatment predicted poorer subsequent, long-term weight control at one year and at two years.   For example, someone who lost four pounds one week, regained two and then lost one the next tended to fare worse than someone who lost one pound consistently each week for three weeks.   Interestingly, individuals who reported lower emotional eating, binge eating and preoccupation with food at the start of the study showed higher weight variability and less weight loss overall.    This suggests that initial weight change, rather than relationships with or behaviors toward food, is much more important in predicting who will succeed in weight loss and maintenance, the authors conclude.    It’s also possible that variation in weight loss from one week to the next slows down overall weight loss, making it harder for people to achieve long-term weight loss goals, said Susan Roberts of the USDA Nutrition Center at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts.    “So people who are on their program some weeks but not others will inevitably lose less weight because you can’t really catch up in the sense of making up bad weeks,” Roberts, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “At best, you can only get back on track.”   Participants who had more consistent results might also do more thorough job of tracking what they eat and how much they exercise, said Dr. Anne McTiernan of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.    “Perhaps the people with variability are having a harder time being careful about counting calories, watching what they eat, and staying active,” McTiernan, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Slow and steady wins the race.”   "
2wMvHFZ,2017-08-29,Red powder used in Hindu ceremonies could have unsafe lead levels,"  (This August 28 story was refiled to clarify, in paragraph four and eleven, that both researchers work for Rutgers School of Public Health)                    A woman has her forehead smeared with vermilion powder after worshipping the Sun god Surya in the waters of a lake during the Hindu religious festival of Chatt Puja in Agartala, India, November 17, 2015.  REUTERS/Jayanta Dey      By Carolyn Crist   (Reuters Health) - Sindoor powder sold in the United States and India could have unsafe levels of lead, researchers warn.    Sindoor, also called vermilion, is a brilliant scarlet powder used during Hindu religious and cultural ceremonies. Sindoor is often used by women who wear a bindi, or red dot, on their foreheads for cosmetic purposes. Married women may also put it in their hair, and men and children may wear it for religious purposes. Some manufacturers use lead tetroxide to give it a distinctive red color.     Of the 118 sindoor samples tested in the study, 95 were from South Asian stores in New Jersey. Another 23 came from stores in Mumbai and New Delhi, in India. Overall, about 80 percent of the samples had at least some lead, and about a third contained levels above the limit set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.   “We are diverse here with a lot of individuals who emigrate or travel from many parts of the world through airports on a weekly basis,” said study author Dr. Derek Shendell of Rutgers School of Public Health in Piscataway, New Jersey, told Reuters Health by phone. “If there is a product that could be contaminated with lead, it’s of public health interest. There’s possibility of spread through ingestion or inhalation.”   Shendell’s team found that 83 percent of the U.S. samples and 78 percent of the samples from India had at least 1 microgram of lead per gram of powder.    “There is no safe level of lead,” Shendell said. “It shouldn’t be in our bodies, especially for children under age 6.”   “Even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to affect IQ, ability to pay attention, and academic achievement,” the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns. “And effects of lead exposure cannot be corrected. The most important step . . . is to prevent lead exposure before it occurs.”   The FDA’s limit for lead in cosmetics is 20 micrograms per gram. Nineteen percent of the U.S. samples and 43 percent of the India samples exceeded that limit. Five samples - three from the U.S. and two from India - contained more than 10,000 micrograms.    The FDA issued general warnings about sindoor after a 2007 test by the Illinois Department of Health detected high lead content in one brand, which led to a recall by the company. Other cosmetics such as kajal and tiro have been banned due to lead content.    Researchers should continue to monitor sindoor lead levels and make the public aware of potential hazards, the study authors wrote in the American Journal of Public Health.   “Just as we screen kids who live in houses built prior to 1978 with lead-based paint, we should screen children who use sindoor cosmetically,” study author Dr. Bill Halperin of the Rutgers School of Public Health campus in Newark told Reuters Health by phone.   Since the researchers saw variable lead levels in different samples from the same brand, they say it may be tough to determine which sindoor products have lead.   “That puts the burden on the consumer,” Halperin said. “For parents who want to make decisions to benefit their children, it could be a gamble.”   Pediatricians and parents should talk about cultural and cosmetic practices at home, especially during routine child checkups, said Dr. Cristiana Lin of Pediatrix Medical Group in Scottsdale, Arizona, who has studied lead exposure from imported Indian spices and cultural powders.   “It’s disappointing that we’re still finding products with so much lead,” Lin, who wasn’t involved in the current study, told Reuters Health by phone. “But we can spend time with our patients and ask questions.”   “At the end of the day, you can’t assume people’s country of origin or practices, so you open up the conversation,” she said. “We have to respect families and encourage them to stay in their belief systems but also support them.”   Also, she said, “We need companies to be cognizant of this issue and become partners in creating lead-free products. Consumers should be able to make informed choices for themselves and protect their families.”  "
2vFZDP6,2017-08-29,Kids often have a chronic cough after respiratory illness," (Reuters Health) - Children treated for respiratory illnesses in the emergency department often have a chronic cough that lingers for weeks after they go home from the hospital, an Australian study suggests.    Researchers examined data on 839 children treated for acute respiratory illnesses and found roughly three in four kids had a cough one week later. And after 28 days, one in four children had a chronic cough.   “Parents should seek advice if children have a cough lasting more than four weeks that is not getting any better, particularly if it is a wet cough (moist or gurgly sounding cough),” lead study author Dr. Kerry-Ann O’Grady of the Queensland University of Technology in Australia said by email.    There are many causes of chronic cough in kids, but the most common culprit is lung disorders, said senior study author Dr. Anne Chang, also of Queensland University of Technology.    “In most children in the study, the cause of the chronic cough was an underlying lung infection that is easily treated with antibiotics, a condition called protracted bacterial bronchitis,” Chang said by email. “However, most children with cough do not need antibiotics.”   All of the kids in the study were seen at a pediatric emergency department in Brisbane, Australia.   Half were at least 2.3 years old, although they ranged in age from less than one month to almost 15 years.    The children were followed weekly during the study and examined by a pediatric lung specialist after 28 days.    Among the 171 children who still had a cough at the end of the study, 59, or 35 percent, had a wet cough, while 45, or 26 percent, had a dry cough, researchers report in the Archives of Disease in Childhood. (In the rest, the cough was either variable, or the data were missing.)   Pulmonologists identified a new and serious chronic lung disease in 36 children, and 55 had protracted bacterial bronchitis.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how an acute respiratory infection might lead to a chronic cough or a lung disorder. It’s also possible that at least some of the kids had a lung condition prior to their initial visit to the emergency department with a respiratory illness.    However, chronic cough is a common health problem for kids that is usually treatable and can cause serious complications if it’s not properly diagnosed and treated, said Dr. Andre Schultz, a pulmonologist at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in Perth, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Chronic cough that is left untreated can result in permanent lung damage,” Schultz said by email.    Bacterial infections, for example, can cause progressive damage to the lungs and eventually permanent scarring if children don’t receive proper treatment,” Schultz said. This type of infection is often the culprit of chronic wet coughs when kids don’t have asthma.    “Respiratory infections could also be an indication of an underlying lung disease not yet diagnosed,” said Dr. Lilly Verhagen, a researcher at Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital in Utrecht, The Netherlands, who wasn’t involved in the study.    Because the study only included kids treated in the emergency department for respiratory problems, the results might not be the same for all kids treated by primary care providers, Verhagen, said by email.    But parents should still be aware that a chronic cough needs to be checked out, Verhagen said.    “If a child has a persistent cough lasting at least four weeks after a respiratory infection that was severe enough to require a hospital visit, parents should return for physician review and consideration of underlying lung disease,” Verhagen advised.

2wJ6vPM,2017-08-26,"Access to female condoms improving under Medicaid, but obstacles to use remain"," (Reuters Health) - More states are making female condoms available through Medicaid, a new study found. But few women are using them, researchers say.     The female condom is a barrier contraceptive method that protects against both unwanted pregnancy and the transmission of sexually transmitted infections, or STIs. Female condoms have been available since the mid-1990s.   The number of states where Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income individuals, provides women with female condoms rose more than 30 percent from 2007 to 2016, researchers report.   When Susan Witte at the Columbia University School of Social Work in New York City and colleagues contacted Medicaid representatives from each state, they found that 36 states currently provide reimbursement for female condoms - 11 states more than in 2007.   Twenty-nine states provided data on claims for female condoms between 2004 and 2014. Some states reported increases in reimbursements while others had decreases.    “Some states had thousands of claims, whereas others had few to none. Some states reimbursed hundreds of thousands of dollars, but others reimbursed less than $10 per year,” the authors wrote in the American Journal of Public Health.   Overall, the numbers of claims appeared to be low, according to the authors.   “Used correctly, the female condom can provide as much protection as the male condom,” Witte noted.    Furthermore, a woman can choose on her own to use it and she can insert it herself, and it is among the few contraceptive options that are also drug and chemical-free, said Witte.   But structural barriers, including poor marketing and a lack of accurate information, may hinder access to and use of the device, Witte said.   For women who must pay for them out of pocket, retail price is likely another barrier. In the U.S., on Amazon.com, female condoms cost about $10 apiece. While at least one study found that female condoms can be carefully washed and reused several times, the World Health Organization recommends using a new one for every act of intercourse where there is a risk of unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection, including HIV.   Witte believes increasing awareness and building ‘peer norms’ is essential to increasing demand for female condom use.   “In other words, if I use it, and I talk to my friend about it, and then she tells her friend, we start to build awareness to lead to increased use,” she said.   If demand would increase, supplies might increase, said Witte.   In the meantime, if healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, medical social workers, community health workers and others know of the device and introduce it, more women might use it, she said.

2xtqZcx,2017-08-24,Surgery survival for elderly tied to frailty and cognitive skills," Reuters Health - Taking both physical frailty and cognitive impairment into account may yield a better estimate than either factor alone of the odds an older person will survive after major surgery, a U.S. study suggests.    Researchers examined data on 330 older adults who had major surgery, including 168 who were considered “robust” because they didn’t appear to have any cognitive problems or issues with physical frailty. Over four years of follow-up, 53 patients died.    Among patients who were robust or only cognitively impaired, around 12 percent died. Among those who were physically frail but not cognitively impaired, mortality was 25 percent. But with both frailty and cognitive problems, deaths rose to 42 percent, researchers report in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons.     “Cognitive impairment in frail surgical patients is a strong predictor of worsening survival,” said senior study author Dr. Viraj Master of Emory University in Atlanta.   While the study didn’t examine why the combination of cognitive impairment and physical frailty might hasten death, it’s possible that people with only one of these problems are better able to compensate for deficits from the other condition, Master said by email.    “The decreased physiological and cognitive reserves of patients undergoing major surgery make it difficult for patients to not only physically heal and recover after a surgery, but mentally understand how to care for their needs and use mental judgment to make decisions about their care,” Master said.    For the study, researchers examined data from cognitive skills assessments done by asking patients to draw clocks. These tests rely on executive function and visual and spatial planning skills rather than on education or language ability.    In addition, researchers analyzed data from tests of walking speed, activity levels, weakness and exhaustion to determine which patients were physically frail.    In the robust group of patients who didn’t have cognitive impairment or frailty, 20 of 168 died within four years.    In the group that was both frail and cognitively impaired, 11 of 26 patients died.   Compared to robust patients, those with frailty and cognitive impairment were four times more likely to die.    Patients were 58 years old on average, and they most often were having surgery to remove a kidney, prostate or part of the bladder. More than half of them had operations for cancer.    One limitation of the study is that there isn’t one universally used clock-drawing test, so it’s possible the results researchers got in this study might be different if the experiment were done with a different test, the researchers note.   The study was also done at a single academic medical center in Georgia, and most patients were white and undergoing elective surgery, making it possible that results would be different in other groups of people or at other hospitals in other parts of the country.    Even so, the findings suggest that assessing cognitive and physical abilities before surgery might help identify patients who are more likely to die or have complications, said Dr. Bellal Joseph of the University of Arizona in Tucson.    “This study highlights that the patients that suffer from both frailty and cognitive impairments have more stressors going into surgery,” Joseph, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “The other group that is always worrisome is the ‘prefrail,’ those that are on the verge of frailty, because surgery could push them over the edge into frailty.”   When doctors identify high-risk patients in advance, they may be able to offer people rehabilitation or recommend changes in nutrition, exercise or drug regimens that might make them more robust heading into surgery, Joseph said.    “The good news is that we believe that we can improve frail patients with prehabilitation,” Joseph added.

2xtB4WX,2017-08-23,Brain activity tied to blood pressure during stress," (Reuters Health) - Brain scans obtained during psychological stress might someday help doctors identify people who are at higher risk for heart disease, a new study suggests.      Researchers found that a particular pattern of brain activity during frustrating and stressful situations was tied to a larger-than-expected increase in blood pressure.    Surges in blood pressure during stressful situations can predict future cardiovascular problems, senior author Peter Gianaros of the University of Pittsburgh told Reuters Health.   “We’re trying to basically decode brain patterns that can tell us about a person’s sensitivity to stress that might be connected with their risk of heart disease,” he said.   For the new study, Gianaros and colleagues recruited 157 men and 153 women, ages 30 to 51, and had them undergo brain scans while hooked up to blood pressure and heart rate monitors. The participants also completed tasks designed to frustrate.   “We made the tasks purposely difficult so they made a lot of errors,” said Gianaros. “Then we reminded them they were making mistakes.”   Before the tests began, participants’ average blood pressure was around 121/73 millimeters of mercury (mm/Hg), which is about normal.   “For most people, their blood pressure and heart rate went up a little bit, but what we’re interested in is the person-to-person differences,” Gianaros said.   For example, did blood pressure and heart rate increase more in some people than in others?   For some people, specific brain activity patterns did predict  cardiovascular responses. But brain activity patterns could only account for about 10 percent of the difference between individual responses, the authors report in the Journal of the American Heart Association.   “A lot of the person-to-person differences were unaccounted for by what we were able to do,” said Gianaros, who called the study a “proof of concept.”   The study also can’t prove that a specific brain activity pattern causes people to have larger increases in blood pressure or heart rate, said Dr. Larry Goldstein, who chairs the department of neurology at the University of Kentucky in Lexington.   “It’s obviously quite complicated, but gaining these insights can hopefully lead to testable questions and approaches targeting cardiovascular events,” said Goldstein, who wasn’t involved in the new study.   Gianaros said more results are expected from this study, because the research team is still monitoring the participants.   “(We’re going to) test whether brain activity can predict a person’s change in heart disease risk over multiple years,” he said.

2wjszk0,2017-08-24,Kids who skip breakfast may miss key nutrients," Reuters Health - Children who skip breakfast on a regular basis are likely to fall short for the day in getting all their recommended essential nutrients, a UK study suggests.   Kids who skipped breakfast every day were less likely to get enough iron, calcium, iodine and folate when compared to kids who ate breakfast every day, the research team found.    “A greater proportion of those children who ate breakfast met their recommended intakes of these micronutrients compared to breakfast skippers,” coauthors Gerda Pot and Janine Coulthard of Kings College London told Reuters Health in an email interview.   “These findings suggest that eating breakfast could play an important role in ensuring that a child consumes enough of these key micronutrients,” Pot and Coulthard said.   Though older children were more likely to skip breakfast, the day’s nutrient shortfall was greater when younger children missed the morning meal.   “Our research indicated that although lower proportions of 4-to-10-year-olds skipped breakfast regularly compared to 11-to-18-year-olds, greater differences in micronutrient intakes were seen in the younger age group when comparing days on which they ate breakfast with days on which they skipped it. It may, therefore, be particularly important to ensure that this younger age group eats a healthy breakfast, either at home or at a school breakfast club.”   Researchers examined four-day food diaries for almost 1,700 children ages 4 to 18. The information was taken from a yearly national diet and nutrition survey between 2008 and 2012.    Breakfast was defined as consuming more than 100 calories between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m.    Overall, about 31 percent of kids ate breakfast daily, 17 percent never ate breakfast, and the rest ate it some days and skipped it on others. In this group, the researchers also compared differences in nutrient intake by the same child on different days.   The team found that 6.5 percent of kids aged 4 to 10 missed breakfast every day, compared with nearly 27 percent of 11-to-18-year-olds.    Girls were more likely to miss breakfast than boys, and household income tended to be higher for families of children who ate breakfast every day.    More than 30 percent of kids who skipped breakfast did not get enough iron during the day, compared to less than 5 percent of kids who ate breakfast, the researchers report in British Journal of Nutrition.   Around 20 percent of breakfast skippers were low on calcium and iodine, compared to roughly 3 percent of kids who ate breakfast.   About 7 percent of children who skipped breakfast were low in folate, compared to none in the groups that ate breakfast.   Fat intake went up when kids skipped breakfast, researchers found.    Kids who skipped breakfast didn’t seem to compensate by eating more calories later in the day. In fact, kids who didn’t eat breakfast ended up eating the same number or fewer total calories as kids who ate breakfast every day.    Making sure kids eat breakfast appears to be more difficult in the older age group, who are possibly less receptive to parental supervision, Pot and Coulthard said.   “One tactic would be to get children involved in making breakfast, maybe even preparing something the night before if time is short in the morning.”   The authors noted there are a wealth of healthy, simple and tasty recipe ideas available on social media that children can choose from, adding that kids might even like to post a picture of their creations online.

2wF5TuC,2017-08-23,Many heart failure patients don’t recognize the risks of their illness," (Reuters Health) - Even though doctors think most people with heart failure have a high likelihood of requiring a heart transplant or dying from complications of their illness, a small U.S. study suggests that many patients see a much rosier picture of their future.    In the survey of patients and physicians, doctors thought that 69 percent of patients were likely to die or need a transplant or what’s know as a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) to help their heart keep pumping within the next year.    But just 14 percent of patients expected any of these outcomes to happen to them, researchers report in JACC: Heart Failure.    “Part of this is that hope is human nature - patients think they will beat the odds,” said lead study author Dr. Amrut Ambardekar, medical director of the cardiac transplant program at the University of Colorado in Aurora.    Almost 6 million Americans have heart failure, and it’s one of the most common reasons older adults go to the hospital, according to the American Heart Association.   It happens when the heart muscle is too weak to pump enough blood through the body. Symptoms can include fatigue, weight gain from fluid retention, shortness of breath and coughing or wheezing. Medications can help strengthen the heart and minimize fluid buildup in the body.   A realistic assessment of a patient’s prospects is needed to make decisions about interventions like heart transplantation or LVAD, the study team writes.   Unlike many other chronic health problems, the disease doesn’t progress in a linear way, and that may contribute to the mismatch in expectations between patients and doctors, Ambardekar said by email.    “Patients have a hard time knowing their odds for survival as they may have been at a low, but then responded to a treatment and stabilized,” Ambardekar said. “Patients may have been sick, but then responded to treatments in the past so they think they will respond again.”   For the study, physicians rated 161 patients on perceived risk for transplant, LVAD or death in the upcoming year. The patients rated themselves on the same risks.   Predictions by both patients and physicians turned out to be poor, the study team notes.   Overall, 21 percent of patients died during the study period. Another 8 percent got transplants and 9 percent received LVAD devices.    Researchers also assessed whether patients were willing to consider other life-sustaining therapies to treat advanced heart failure, such as ventilation to help with breathing, dialysis to do the job of failing kidneys or a feeding tube.    While 77 percent of the patients considered high risk by physicians said they would consider LVAD, 66 percent of them said they would decline other life-sustaining therapies.    Beyond its small size, another limitation of the study is that patients and doctors were surveyed only once, at the start of the study, and it’s possible their perceptions of risk and willingness to consider certain therapies or treatments might change over time, the authors note.    Even so, it suggests that there’s room for improvement in how doctors and patients communicate, said Dr. Roberta Florido, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Whether altering one’s perception of their prognosis through enhanced information makes them `healthier or happier longer’ is unknown,” Florido said by email. “However, when patients are more knowledgeable about their prognosis and care options, they are more likely to make informed decisions about their goals and receive medical care that is aligned with their preferences.”  "
2wgQYaz,2017-08-18,Alcohol may impair tired drivers even if they aren’t drunk," Reuters Health - People with blood alcohol levels below the legal cutoff for being considered drunk may still be unsafe drivers if they’re also sleep deprived, a small experiment suggests.    Researchers tested drowsiness and attention in 16 healthy young men exposed to either sleep deprivation or alcohol consumption, or to both at once.    They found that the combination of moderate alcohol consumption - within legal limits for driving - and restricting sleep to just five hours a night produced greater drowsiness and more deficits in attention than either sleep restriction or alcohol intake alone.    The combined effects of alcohol and sleep deprivation lasted two to three hours, the study found.   “No amount of alcohol intake has been deemed safe when under the influence of sleepiness through either poor or inadequate sleep, or being awake when the body (should be) asleep at night,” said study co-author Clare Anderson of the Institute of Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience at Monash University in Australia.    “Our take-home message would therefore be to avoid alcohol when feeling sleepy and to have a short nap before attempting to drive or undertaking any other safety critical task,” Anderson said by email.    Previous research has shown that alcohol can impair motor coordination, critical thinking skills and decision-making and may lead people to take more risks than they might while sober. Sleep deprivation, meanwhile, has been linked to distraction and delayed reaction times.    In the current experiment, men between 18 and 27 years old were assessed four times. Researchers asked the participants to rate their level of drowsiness, tested their focus and attention with eye-movement measurements, and examined their response speed to stimuli by seeing how fast they could push a button when an image flashed on a computer screen.   At the start of the study, researchers ran men through these tests without any intervention. Then they repeated the same assessments after alcohol or sleep deprivation alone or in combination.    Outside the experimental conditions, the men typically went to bed between 10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. and woke up between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. To create a state of sleep deprivation, men were allowed to rest only from 2:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. the night before the test session.   During alcohol assessments, performed more than four hours after men woke up for the day, participants were given enough to drink to raise their blood alcohol level to 0.05 percent - the legal driving limit in Australia, the UK and many European countries. The legal limit in the U.S. is 0.08 percent.   Researchers tested the men’s attention and vigilance one hour after they drank alcohol and again every 30 minutes for two hours.    When men were deprived of sleep and also given alcohol, they were most impaired about 90 minutes after they drank, the study team reports in Human Psychopharmacology.   It took about 2.5 hours for men to return to their performance levels before having the drink, even when they got rest breaks between rounds of testing.    Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the focus on healthy young men, which means the results might be different for older people or individuals with physical or mental health issues that can impact driving ability.    Even so, the findings suggest that people who no longer feel “buzzed” from drinking may still be unsafe behind the wheel, said Russell Griffin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the study.    “So while you may feel fine driving home when you leave that party, that feeling can make a turn for the worse on the drive home, particularly since alcohol increases the feeling and effects of sleep deprivation,” Griffin said by email.    The results should also serve as a reminder to drink in moderation.    “The body is only able to metabolize, or remove, a little bit of alcohol at a time, so the more alcohol a person drinks, the more alcohol is circulating through their system and the higher the impairment,” Griffin said.   "
2vL18Pf,2017-08-18,Surgeries to remove weight-loss devices on the rise," Reuters Health - Doctors are doing fewer weight-loss procedures to implant adjustable bands around the stomach and more operations to remove the devices or alter them, a U.S. study suggests.   Researchers focused on a type of weight-loss surgery known as laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, a minimally invasive procedure that involves placing an inflatable belt around the upper portion of the stomach that reduces the amount of food it can hold. People are advised to eat portions about the size of a shot glass post-surgery.   Nationwide, a total of 28,202 patients underwent procedures to implant laparoscopic adjustable gastric bands (LAGB) from 2007 to 2015, the study found. Over that same period, 12,157 people had gastric bands removed, or explanted.   Starting in 2013, though, surgeons did more procedures to take bands out than to put them in, the study team reports in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons.    A newer alternative in weight-loss surgery known as a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy that appears to be safer and more effective may be driving this trend, said senior study author Dr. Ninh Nguyen, chief of the division of gastrointestinal and bariatric surgery at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine.   “Compared to the adjustable gastric banding, the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is associated with improved weight loss and lower incidence of late complications,” Nguyen said by email. “The late complication rate requiring revision (procedures) after sleeve gastrectomy is one-fourth that of gastric banding.”   More than half of weight-loss procedures done today use the sleeve gastrectomy, which reduces the stomach to the size of a banana, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery.    Procedures to remove or adjust gastric bands were associated with longer hospital stays, a greater number of serious complications and more admissions to intensive care units compared with operations to implant the devices, the study found.    Researchers didn’t find any difference in death rates or costs between implantation procedures and operations to remove or fix the bands, with both types of surgery costing an average of $11,600 to $12,000.    One limitation of the study is that researchers only examined procedures done at academic medical centers, although the authors suggest that trends might be similar at community hospitals.    Another drawback is the lack of data explaining why bands were removed. That makes it impossible to say if the removal happened after complications or because patients elected to switch to a different, newer alternative such as the sleeve gastrectomy to see if they could achieve more weight loss.    Most often, when the gastric bands are removed it’s either because patients couldn’t tolerate the devices being tightened or because they didn’t lose enough weight, said Dr. Anita Courcoulas, chief of minimally invasive bariatric and general surgery at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.   Because the sleeve is still relatively new, however, it’s too soon to say whether it will achieve better weight loss or fewer complications over the long term, Courcoulas, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “Enthusiasm for the sleeve as a replacement for the band should be tempered with the knowledge that longer-term outcomes are still sorely lacking,” Courcoulas added. “It will take time, patience, and a dynamic evaluation of the evidence as it evolves to draw more final conclusions about the longer-term comparative effectiveness of bariatric procedures.”  "
2v5athc,2017-08-17,Adult gambling addiction tied to childhood trauma," Reuters Health - Men with gambling addictions are more likely than their peers to have endured childhood traumas like physical abuse or violence at home, and treatment needs to address this underlying stressor, researchers say.     They examined survey data on a nationally representative group of 3,025 UK men aged 18 to 64 and found that roughly 5 percent had apparent gambling problems and about 7 percent were serious addicts.    Compared with men who rarely if ever placed wagers, the men with a pathological addiction to gambling were more than twice as likely to have witnessed violence at home or to have experienced physical abuse or assault growing up. They were also more than three times as likely to have suffered a serious or life-threatening injury as kids.    As adults, the men with severe gambling addiction were more likely to experience violence at home and at work; have relationships or marriages fall apart; lose jobs; have serious money problems; become homeless and be convicted of crimes.    “Gambling has been suggested as a potential coping mechanism, often among females,” said senior study author Dr. Jason Landon of Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand. “Often the view is that males gamble for enjoyment, or to win, and females gamble to escape,” he said by email.   “Our study is important as it . . . shows that harmful gambling is associated with early and adult trauma - even when alcohol and drug use are controlled for - amongst a representative sample of males,” Landon said by email.    For the study, psychologists examined men’s survey responses about a variety of factors that can influence whether they develop a tendency to gamble.    Roughly one in four men who were compulsive gamblers, meaning addicts who placed bets regardless of their mood or whether they were winning or losing, witnessed violence as kids, as did 23 percent of the men classified as problem gamblers, the study found.    About 10 percent of compulsive and problem gamblers also experienced physical abuse or assaults as children.   By comparison, only 8 percent of the men without a gambling problem witnessed violence at home growing up and less than 4 percent suffered physical abuse or assault, the study team reports in Addictive Behaviors.    Even after researchers accounted for drug and alcohol dependence, which often accompany gambling addiction, men who were compulsive gamblers were significantly more likely than non-gamblers to have experienced domestic violence in childhood and adulthood as well as job loss, money problems and relationship failures as adults.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how childhood traumas may influence the odds of gambling addiction later in life.    Other limitations include a lack of data on arrests or convictions to confirm childhood trauma or violent experiences in adulthood, as well as the possibility that the survey misclassified the gambling habits of some participants, the authors note.    Even so, the findings add to growing evidence linking stressful life experiences to the development of addictions, said Julia Poole, a researcher at the University of Calgary in Canada who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Individuals with a history of child adversity appear more likely than those without such history to report subsequent disordered gambling as adolescents and adults,” Poole, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   This doesn’t mean, however, that every person with a traumatic childhood will grow up to become a compulsive gambler, Poole said. Emotional regulation, or how well people are able to recognize and alter emotional reactions, may also influence whether addiction develops.   “This means that enhancing effective emotional regulation strategies among gamblers who report a history of childhood adversity may help gamblers utilize more-effective coping strategies and live a life free from their addictions,” Poole said.

2vMA0hd,2017-08-17,Long-term gum disease linked to Alzheimer&#039;s disease," (Reuters Health) - Chronic gum inflammation, known as periodontitis, is associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, researchers from Taiwan report.   Chronic periodontitis, a leading cause of tooth loss, is also associated with increases in markers of inflammation throughout the body. Some recent studies have suggested that chronic periodontitis might contribute to a decline in thinking ability, the authors note in Alzheimer’s Research and Therapy.   Dr. Yu-Chao Chang’s team from Chung Shan Medical University in Taichung City used data from Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database to examine whether patients age 50 or older with chronic periodontitis had an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.    They found no overall link between periodontitis and Alzheimer’s, but people who had the chronic gum inflammation for 10 or more years were 70 percent more likely than people without periodontitis to develop Alzheimer’s disease.    The link between long-term periodontitis and Alzheimer’s was present even after researchers adjusted for other factors that might influence the development of Alzheimer’s, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and urban environment.    “Our findings support the notion that infectious diseases associated with low-grade inflammation, such as chronic periodontitis, may play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease,” the study team concludes.   “These findings highlight the need to prevent progression of periodontal disease and promote healthcare services at the national level,” they add.   “In fact, it is believed that the association between periodontitis and Alzheimer´s disease may be bi-directional,” said Dr. Yago Leira Feijoo from Universidad de Santiago de Compostela in Spain who wasn’t involved in the study. “Currently, with the scientific evidence that is available, we cannot be sure if the risk factor is either periodontal disease or Alzheimer´s disease,” Leira Feijoo said by email.    “Because periodontitis is a preventable and treatable disease, periodontal patients should be aware of the potential risks of gum infection and the systemic impact that could have,” he added.   Dr. Ingar Olsen from University of Oslo in Norway, who also wasn’t involved in the study, told Reuters Health, “Dental care of old people should not be neglected.”    “Brush your teeth carefully to prevent development of periodontitis,” Olsen added.   Dr. Chang did not respond to a request for comments.  "
2vMTUZv,2017-08-17,"Preemies do better now than years ago, but still at risk"," (Reuters Health) - Children born very prematurely today are more likely than those born years ago to survive without a serious disability, but they’re still at risk for developmental delays, according to a new study from France.   “We know medical practice and the organization of care have changed over the past 15 years,” said senior author Dr. Pierre-Yves Ancel, of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) in Paris. “It’s important to examine whether the outcomes have changed.”   Smaller studies over past decades have showed improvements in outcomes of children born extremely premature, “but we haven’t been able to get a population study,” study co-author Dr. Andrei Morgan, who is also affiliated with INSERM, told Reuters Health.   Ancel and Morgan and colleagues used data collected nationally in France over two years, starting in March 2011, on 5,170 children born between 22 and 34 weeks gestation. A full-term pregnancy lasts 39 to 41 weeks.   About 52 percent of children born between 22 and 26 weeks gestation survived to age 2 years. That was true for 93 percent of babies born after 27 to 31 weeks gestation and for nearly 99 percent for those born at 32 to 34 weeks.   The risk of cerebral palsy decreased with longer gestation.   When the researchers compared their findings to data from a previous study started in 1997, they found that the proportion of extremely premature infants surviving to age 2 without moderate or severe disability had generally increased.   For babies born at 25 to 26 weeks, for example, the rate of survival without moderate or severe physical disabilities rose from about 46 percent in 1997 to about 62 percent in 2011.   But the premature infants born more recently were still at risk for developmental delays, such as problems with communication abilities, gross motor skills, fine motor skills, problem solving abilities and personal-social skills.   Rates of those problems were about 50 percent among babies born at 22 to 26 weeks, about 41 percent among those born at 27 to 31 weeks and about 36 percent in preemies born at 32 to 34 weeks, the researchers report in The BMJ.   “I think it’s also important and interesting to know that outcomes are improving, but there are children who remain at risk at higher gestational ages,” said Morgan.   The research team hopes to learn more about outcomes when the children are 5 and 10 years old, Ancel said.   “These results are important, but we need more information in the long term,” he said.  "
2hnIRSZ,2017-08-15,Abortion after-care costs driven up by scarcity of nearby clinics," (Reuters Health) - The absence of a nearby abortion clinic drives up healthcare costs, a study of California’s poor has found.   Women who seek follow-up care but who don’t have a local clinic often feel compelled go to an emergency room to confirm that their pregnancy is over, a practice that typically increases the abortion bill by 76 percent.   More clinics in rural, underserved areas and better alternatives for follow-up care - such as consultations via phone, video or the internet - could dramatically reduce that extra expense, said the team, lead by Dr. Ushma Upadhyay of the University of California, San Francisco.   The risks associated with abortion may be low, Upadhyay told Reuters Health by phone, but the need by some women to seek care after the procedure reflects “wanting to have someone to talk to about their symptoms and not being sure if it was successful. They want to get reassurance, if they’re experiencing cramping and bleeding, that those are normal side effects after an abortion. Some women are unsure how much bleeding is normal and how much is a warning sign.”   The study, released by the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, comes at a time when state efforts to block abortion, combined with more-effective long-term birth control, have dramatically reduced the number of abortion clinics in the United States, with states such as Mississippi, Missouri, Wyoming and North and South Dakota each having only a single facility.   Not only does the requirement to travel long distances pose practical problems that make it harder to arrange for the procedure,” Dr. Upadhyay said, it can potentially reduce the quality of any after-procedure treatment as well.   “If they need follow-up care, they are seeking it from local hospitals that might not be familiar with signs and symptoms of abortion, so there’s less continuity of care for those women,” she said.   The result could be unnecessary prescribing of antibiotics or an unwarranted attempt to redo the abortion, the team said.   To gauge the effect of travel time when women are seeking after-abortion care, usually to confirm that the procedure was successful, the Upadhyay team looked at data on nearly 40,000 abortions in 2011 and 2012 covered by California’s Medicaid program for the poor.   Women who had to travel at least 100 minutes to a clinic were 2.3 times more likely to show up at an emergency department for follow-up care than women who lived within 25 miles of a clinic. The trend was seen whether or not they received a conventional aspiration abortion or a drug-induced abortion.   The median cost to Medicaid for the emergency department visit: $941. The cost was $536 if the woman went back to the clinic.   Among all abortion recipients, only 3 percent ended up in the emergency department and 25 percent went back to the clinic. In most cases, the return visit was made by women who had been given an abortion pill and they wanted to confirm that the pill had done its work.   Upadhyay, an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at UCSF, said the ability to have video or phone conferencing with a clinic should help reduce the need for those follow-up visits.   “I think we would see emergency department visits decline if patients could get their follow-up questions taken care of,” she said.

2x1AdfS,2017-08-15,Some jobs tied to higher risk of rheumatoid arthritis," (Reuters Health) - Workers exposed to airborne toxins may have an elevated risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, an immune system disorder that causes debilitating swelling and pain in the joints, a Swedish study suggests.   Among men, bricklayers, concrete workers and electricians had at least twice the risk of rheumatoid arthritis they would have in certain other occupations, the study found. For women, jobs in nursing carried a 30 percent higher risk than other careers.    “Previous studies have indicated that occupations within the manufacturing sector are associated with an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis,” said lead study author Anna Ilar of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden.   “The novelty of our findings is that we showed that occupations within this sector are related to an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis even after controlling for lifestyle-related factors including smoking, alcohol use, education and (obesity),” Ilar said by email.    Unlike the more common osteoarthritis, which is caused by mechanical wear and tear on joints, in rheumatoid arthritis the immune system attacks the body’s joints.   While smoking is a known risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis, the findings add to evidence suggesting that environmental factors could trigger the disease in some people. Previous research suggests that lung changes caused by inhaled pollutants may trigger immune responses that lead to rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in individuals with a genetic predisposition for the disease.    For the current study, reported in Arthritis Care and Research, researchers examined data on 3,522 people with rheumatoid arthritis and 5,580 similar individuals without the condition. They gathered information on work history from questionnaires and analyzed results form blood samples looking for genetic factors that can contribute to the disorder.    Researchers compared the elevated risk of rheumatoid arthritis in manufacturing occupations to the risk associated with professional, administrative and technical jobs that tend to involve deskwork rather than manual labor.    Compared with men working desk jobs, electrical workers had twice the risk of rheumatoid arthritis and bricklayers and concrete workers had roughly triple the risk.   The study didn’t find an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis for women working in the manufacturing sector, but there may have been too few women in these jobs to properly analyze the impact of this work, the researchers say.    It’s possible that inhaled toxins such as silica, asbestos, organic solvents and motor exhaust might have contributed to the development of rheumatoid arthritis, but the study didn’t analyze which pollutants caused the condition.   One limitation of the study is that researchers assumed people in professional jobs in doing office work didn’t have exposure to toxins that may increase the odds of rheumatoid arthritis. The study also wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how certain occupations might cause rheumatoid arthritis.     They also didn’t directly examine the influence of manual labor on development of rheumatoid arthritis, said Kaleb Michaud, a researcher at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and co-director of the National Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases.   “There is some evidence that greater physical labor, which can cause more stress on the body physically and mentally, can lead to rheumatoid arthritis,” Michaud, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “Not getting enough sleep and continuous repetitive tasks can lead to added stress that can impact your immune system,” Michaud added. “The more triggers to the immune system just increase the chances for an irregular response by it that may lead to an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis.”  "
2wa1dNN,2017-08-16,Partial lead-pipe replacements bring down levels of toxins," Reuters Health - New research clarifies the benefits of having utilities replace municipal lead water-service lines, even when the pipe that enters a home continues to be made of the metal that can impair children’s brain development.   Previous studies based on laboratory setups showed that partial replacements of old service lines made of lead could increase corrosion and elevate lead levels at the tap, said Michele Prevost, professor of environmental engineering at Polytechnique Montreal in Quebec, Canada. The studies prompted some municipalities to leave aging lead pipes in place at otherwise opportune times to change them.    But the new study found that compared to homes with no water line replacement, homes with partial replacements had lower levels of lead in the water. Although lead continued to leach into the water, lead levels were significantly lower after partial replacements.   The message, according to senior author Prevost: “Don’t stop the utilities from replacing what they can.”   Because utilities are responsible for just part of water lines, and homeowners are responsible for the rest, utilities frequently must decide whether to replace just their portion of lead pipes.    The best way to handle lead pipes is to change them out entirely by replacing both the homeowners’ and the utility’s pipes, Prevost said in a phone interview. When not possible, however, she said the new study in Environmental Science and Technology shows that partial replacements can lower lead levels.   Dr. Jennifer A. Lowry, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ council on environmental health, said the finding of decreased lead concentrations after partial replacements made sense.   “But, anytime you disrupt the line, flakes of lead and other things will break off and contaminate the line. So, you need to flush the line before it is used,” she said by email. Lowry, chief of toxicology and environmental health at Children’s Mercy Kansas City, was not involved with the new study.   The remaining problem, Prevost said, is that no one has yet figured out how to sufficiently flush.    “We know we need to flush it well, but we don’t know how long,” she said. “It’s a bit of a Russian roulette.”   “Immediately after replacement, if you don’t flush the water, the lead concentrations are so high that one single glass of water could represent an acute dose, enough to give a child lead poisoning,” she said.    Lowry stressed the importance of alerting the public when water lines are being replaced so they know to wait until the water is safe before they drink it. She also stressed the importance of recognizing that multiple lead sources - paint, jewelry and foods, for example, in addition to drinking water - can contaminate children simultaneously.   The new study examined levels of drinking water in 33 Canadian households with partly replaced pipe. Immediately after partial replacements, lead levels spiked as high as 30,485 micrograms per liter. But they dropped to as low as 7 micrograms per liter after 30 minutes of flushing.    During the course of 20 months, water lead levels decreased, but in 61 percent of the study samples they still exceeded 10 micrograms per liter, the World Health Organization’s cautionary level.   The lowest lead levels were seen in homes with lines that were partially replaced more than two years before the study began or that received a full upgrade.   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention caution that there is no safe level of exposure to lead. A neurotoxin, it is particularly harmful to young children and to the unborn children of pregnant women.    Lead can impair children’s neurodevelopment and has been tied to lower intelligence, learning disabilities, antisocial behavior and even criminality. In adults, lead can cause hypertension and cardiovascular disease.    In 1986, Congress banned the use of lead in pipes conveying drinking water. But lead pipes still carry drinking water to millions of Canadians and Americans, including in Flint, Michigan.   Flint’s water contamination problem emerged after the city switched its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in 2014. The more corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes. Flint switched back to the previous water system in 2015.   "
2x0TIVI,2017-08-15,Lack of sleep tied to higher risk of diabetes in kids," Reuters Health - Children who don’t get enough sleep may be more likely to develop diabetes than kids who typically get enough shuteye, a UK study suggests.    That’s because each additional hour of sleep children get at night is associated with a lower body weight, more lean muscle mass and less accumulation of sugars in the blood, researchers report in Pediatrics. Obesity and elevated blood sugar are risk factors for type 2 diabetes, which happens when the body can’t properly use or make enough of the hormone insulin to convert blood sugar into energy.   “These findings suggest increasing sleep duration could offer a simple, cost-effective approach to reducing levels of body fat and type 2 diabetes risk early in life,” senior study author Christopher Owen of St. George’s, University of London, said by email.   Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes because it was so rare in children. But today, it’s a common childhood health problem, in large part because millions of kids worldwide are overweight or obese, don’t get enough exercise, and eat too many sugary and fatty foods.     For the current study, researchers examined survey data on sleep habits and lab results from tests of risk factors for diabetes in 4,525 UK children age 9 or 10.    On average, the kids slept 10.5 hours on school nights, although sleep duration ranged from 8 to 12 hours.    Children who got less sleep in the study were more likely to have a risk factor for diabetes known as insulin resistance, when the body doesn’t respond normally to the hormone.    Kids who slept less were also more likely to be extremely overweight or obese and have more body fat, the study also found.    Kids 6 to 12 years old should get 9 to 12 hours of sleep a night, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Not getting enough sleep is associated with an increased risk of injuries, high blood pressure, obesity and depression.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how insufficient sleep might lead to diabetes in children. Researchers also relied on kids to accurately recall and report what time they went to bed and woke up, which might not accurately reflect how much sleep they really got.    Even so, it’s possible that insufficient sleep might negatively impact children’s appetites and ability to regulate blood sugar, said Stacey Simon, a pediatric sleep psychologist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus and Children’s Hospital Colorado.   “When kids are going to bed very late or sleeping on an irregular schedule, they may also be skipping meals, eating at irregular times, or be less likely to exercise during the day,” Simon, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Insufficient sleep can affect levels of hormones that control appetite, making kids hungrier and increasing cravings for sweet and salty snacks, said James Gangwisch, a psychiatry researcher at Columbia University in New York who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Getting enough sleep helps keep our appetite in check and is protective against insulin resistance,” Gangwisch said by email.    Beyond making sure kids have regular bedtime, parents should also focus on what’s known as sleep hygiene, said Femke Rutters of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam.    This can include things like limiting screen time before bed and making sure the bedroom is totally dark at night, Rutters, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   "
2fvunji,2017-08-11,Workplace fumes linked to signs of early lung disease," Reuters Health - Workplace exposure to vapors, gas, dust and fumes increases the likelihood that a CT scan will show early signs of disease in the lung tissue, according to a U.S. study.     “Interstitial lung disease is a family of over 100 diseases each characterized by inflammation and/or scarring (fibrosis) in the walls of the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs,” said study coauthor Dr. David Lederer, who co-directs the Interstitial Lung Disease Program at Columbia University Medical Center in New York.    The causes of interstitial lung disease (ILD) are often unclear.    “Our research group has been studying the causes of the earliest changes in the lungs that precede the development of clinically evident (symptomatic) ILD,” Lederer said in an email interview.   ILDs include “black lung” from working in coal mines, asbestosis from asbestos exposure and pulmonary sarcoidosis, Lederer noted. “Other examples include ILD resulting from autoimmune conditions such as scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis, and ILD resulting from exposure to mold in the home or workplace.”   To get a sense of what role workplace exposures might play in changes that are visible on a lung scan, but may not yet produce symptoms, researchers analyzed data from a large study of cardiovascular disease in adults in six cities: Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and St. Paul, Minnesota and Winston Salem, North Carolina.    The 5,702 study participants had chest CT scans at the start of the study and again six years later. They also reported their work exposure to vapors, gas, dust and fumes, and the researchers drew exposure estimates from data created by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).    Participants with higher exposure scores based on the NIOSH job exposure matrix were likely to have more opaque areas typical of ILD, known as high attenuation areas, especially with dust or gas exposure.    Self-reported exposure to vapor or gases was also linked with an almost doubled risk of interstitial lung abnormalities, the authors reported in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.    Lederer noted that “subclinical ILD occurs before the onset of symptoms, and not all subclinical ILD progresses to the point of developing symptoms.”    In this study, workplace exposures could not be consistently tied to worsening lung problems.    When symptoms do develop, the most common ones are breathlessness during exertion and dry cough (meaning a cough without significant production of sputum or phlegm), he said.   “These symptoms worsen over time and in moderate to severe disease, people living with ILD are prescribed oxygen. Despite the use of oxygen and other treatments, fibrotic forms of ILD eventually become life-threatening,” he added.   The Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation estimates that 40,000 Americans die from ILD each year.   Lederer said the first step in preventing these exposures is to talk to your doctor about the conditions of your workplace and possible exposures in the workplace.    “Workers should obtain the generic names of any chemicals and other agents in the workplace, and either the worker or the patient should obtain Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for each agent,” he said.   In some cases, MSDS’s can be found online, but each employer should also be able to provide them to workers. A review of these MSDS’s can identify whether a particular exposure has been linked to lung disease, Lederer said.   “Workers should also follow the instructions given by their employer regarding the use of personal protective equipment, such as masks, gloves, and respirators,” he said.  "
2vW8D7f,2017-08-11,Sleep therapy may help ease knee pain troubles for some," Patients with knee osteoarthritis and insomnia may be less troubled by joint pain after they get treatment to help them sleep better, a recent study suggests.    Knee osteoarthritis, a leading cause of pain and disability in older adults, occurs when flexible tissue at the ends of bones wears down. While it can’t be cured, physical therapy or anti-inflammatory medications are often prescribed to relieve pain and improve mobility.   More than 70 percent of people with knee osteoarthritis also suffer from sleep disturbances, researchers note in the journal Pain.   For the current study, researchers randomly assigned 100 people with both insomnia and knee osteoarthritis to receive eight sessions of either cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), designed to shift thinking about sleep and bad habits that contribute to insomnia, or behavior desensitization therapy designed to diminish emotional and physical responses to arousing thoughts and behaviors related to sleep.”   Researchers assessed participants’ perceptions of pain before treatment and again three and six months after the interventions finished. The study team expected the CBT-I to achieve a greater reduction in what’s known as pain catastrophizing, or feeling exaggerated levels of pain that are amplified by being emotionally upset about the pain. Instead, they found similar reductions in negative perceptions of pain with both the cognitive behavioral therapy and behavior desensitization.    “Sleep is really important and when it is compromised like in insomnia it can increase the risk for many negative health outcomes, including chronic pain, depression, obesity, high blood pressure and more,” said lead study author Sheera Lerman, a behavioral health researcher at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.    “The good news is that for most people with insomnia, it can be effectively treated without using medication,” Lerman said by email.    Regardless of what intervention they received, participants experienced fewer negative feelings about both daytime and nighttime pain by the end of treatment, and this persisted three and six months afterwards.    People who had greater reductions in nighttime awakenings early in the study also had a larger decline in negative feelings about pain than people who didn’t experience this type of sleep improvement early on.    The results suggest that even brief interventions focused on sleep improvement may make a big dent in negative feelings people have about their pain, the authors conclude.    One limitation of the study is that people started out with relatively low levels of pain catastrophizing, and there might have been a bigger effect from treatment or a larger difference between therapies if participants had more intense negative feelings about their pain, the researchers note.    Without these therapies, there are still many things patients can do to improve their sleep routines that may also influence how they experience pain, said Jean-Michel Brismee, a researcher at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock who wasn’t involved in the study.    Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day can help, as can eating well, avoiding big meals and caffeine in the hours right before bedtime, and getting plenty of exercise, Brismee said by email.    “If you have knee osteoarthritis, walking may hurt . . . so find some activities that do not increase the pain such as tai chi, yoga, and cycling,” Brismee said.    “Do gentle breathing exercises for a couple of minutes while in bed,” Brismee added. “They can lower the activity of your sympathetic nervous system and improve your sleep.”  "
2vWEO6q,2017-08-11,Fire station air quality puts firefighters at risk," (Reuters Health) - Firefighters have higher than average cancer rates, and while their exposure to carcinogens during fires is well known, a new study suggests exposures in fire stations contribute to their excess cancer risk, too.    “Firefighters spend large portions of their shift waiting for calls in a station, during which they can be exposed to diesel exhaust from idling trucks (which is a known carcinogen) and off-gassing from contaminated post-fire gear (which may be contaminated with a variety of known and/or possible carcinogens),” researchers point out in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.   Several studies in recent years have found that firefighters have elevated risks for cancers of the lungs, skin, esophagus, brain, kidney and prostate.    “We know about the chemicals, heat and stress in the field, but what’s left out is the chronic low-level exposure at the fire station during day-to-day business,” lead study author Dr. Emily Sparer of Harvard’s Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston told Reuters Health by phone.    The Boston Fire Department approached Sparer’s team with concerns about firefighters becoming sick at young ages. Although department staff knew that diesel exhaust, dust and ash caused sinus and breathing issues, they weren’t sure when and where the most exposure occurred.   “There are still a lot of questions about why firefighters get cancer,” Sparer said. “By delving into the stations, we’re trying to start the process of answering those questions.”   Sparer and colleagues sampled air particles at four Boston fire stations in spring 2016, looking for particulate matter less than 2.5 millimeters in diameter. These small particles are considered dangerous to human health because they can be inhaled and become lodged in the lungs. They also looked for particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which are chemicals released from burning coal, oil, gas, trash and wood.    They took air samples from the kitchen, truck bay, and outside the station - and conducted interviews with officers at each station to understand health and safety-related policies and practices, such as engine idle-time and washing of contaminated clothing.   Particulate matter was present in higher concentrations in the truck bay than in either the kitchen or the outdoors, but levels varied throughout the day.    Newer building materials and effective separation between the different building zones helped keep levels low in the firefighters’ living areas, the study authors found. Policies for ventilating truck exhaust outside and the washing of bunker gear after a fire also had large influences on air quality.    “What stuck out to me was the degree to which the built environment matters in these stations,” Sparer said. “Seeing the numbers, hearing the stories, and being there in person really helped.”   Sparer and colleagues hope to sample air in additional stations and at different times of the year. They’re also talking to officers at the Boston stations about simple steps they can take to reduce risks, such as removing gym equipment from the truck bay, installing commercial-grade washing machines for gear, and closing doors to living areas, when possible.   “We’re not saying that every old fire department should tear down its station. That’s not feasible,” she said. “But design matters, and there are a few small changes that could prevent these exposures.”   A limitation of the study is the small size, which makes it difficult to assess whether the exposure numbers are exceptional, said Eero Pukkala of the University of Tampere in Helsinki, Finland. Pukkala, who wasn’t involved with this study, has studied cancer among firefighters in Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland and Sweden.   Comparison with other indoor locations, such as other workplaces, would be helpful as well to understand the numbers and the severity that firefighters face, he told Reuters Health by email.   “Of course, it’s important to understand whether these pollutants cause health hazards,” Pukkala added.

2vWEq8b,2017-08-11,Cancer survivors may seek unneeded tests for reassurance," (Reuters Health) - Many people who survive cancer fear recurrence after their treatment ends, according to a study that suggests these concerns may lead to unnecessary tests.   Data from 12 previously published studies involving 849 patients show that after completing treatment, patients want as many follow-up exams and tests as possible to reassure them that tumors have not returned, researchers found.   “Patients want intensive follow-up which comprises a lot of testing,” said senior study author Geertruida de Bock, of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.   “Though this is understandable, it is not desirable since care for cancer is already under pressure due to rising numbers of survivors,” de Bock said by email.    Worldwide, an estimated 33 million people are cancer survivors. Their ranks are expected to grow due to rising cancer rates in an aging population as well as improved survival odds with advances in diagnosis and treatment.    As cancer increasingly becomes a chronic disease instead of a death sentence, doctors and patients are struggling to strike the right balance between doing enough follow-up tests to catch any new tumors quickly and avoiding too many needless tests that can lead to unnecessary interventions that don’t help people live longer.    Cancer survivors typically get care focused on monitoring for the return of tumors or the development of malignancies in other parts of the body. This can include invasive tests like biopsies as well as expensive imaging like positron emission tomographic (PET) scanning.   Guidelines for follow-up tests depend on many factors including the type of cancer, how advanced it was when it was first detected and treated, and individual patient characteristics like age and other health problems.    While the current analysis didn’t examine the outcomes of giving cancer survivors too many or too few tests, it offers fresh evidence that patients may often want more testing than doctors should do based on current treatment guidelines.    For example, some patients said the process of getting more tests and waiting for the results made them anxious, but some patients also said they wanted to continue with a lifetime of extensive follow-up testing.   Patients often said they had lost confidence in their body and feared recurrence so much that they requested screenings that they understood might not be needed. They also expressed a desire for mental health care and psychological support.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to test how or if patients’ preferences about follow-up care influence treatment for cancer survivors.    Even so, the findings suggest that doctors and patients may need to have more-frank conversations about how follow-up tests can help and when extensive testing may do more harm than good.    Patients should understand how many recurrent cancers are typically detected with a specific test and how often they might get what’s known as a false-positive result, when the test result suggests that tumors have returned even though that’s not the case, de Bock said. False negatives, when people with new tumors think they’re cancer-free, are also possible.    “Intensive surveillance can lead to false-positive results and to unnecessary tests and potentially harmful biopsies of suspicious lesions seen on body imaging,” said Dr. Carlos Barcenas, of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. “In addition, a false-negative result of a test may also give a false reassurance to a patient.”   “Patients and doctors should clearly discuss the surveillance plan after active treatments have finished and clarify expectations,” said Barcenas, who wasn’t involved in the study.

2hOckFZ,2017-08-10,Parents can have good quality of life when preemies are grownups," (Reuters Health) - Even though parents of premature babies may be more stressed out than other parents when their kids are young, their quality of life is similar to that of other parents by the time children are grown, a recent study suggests.    Researchers examined data on parents and babies from birth until the children were 27 years old on average. By the end of the study, parents’ quality of life did not differ according to how early their babies arrived, whether kids had disabilities or difficulties in school, or how well they had gotten along with other children.   The exception was for parents of children with mental health problems or difficulties in their relationships with other kids, for whom quality of life was worse, even when kids were grown.   “Expressed simply, parents are happy if their children were happy in childhood and had friends,” lead study author Dieter Wolke, a psychology researcher at the University of Warwick in the U.K., said by email.    Pregnancy normally lasts about 40 weeks, and babies born after 37 weeks are considered full term. The study focused on the most vulnerable preterm infants, delivered before 32 weeks’ gestation or weighing less than 1,500 grams (3.3 pounds) at birth.    In the weeks immediately after birth, preemies often have difficulty breathing and digesting food. They can also encounter longer-term challenges such as impaired vision, hearing and cognitive skills, as well as social and behavioral problems.   The study included 219 parents of underweight and preterm babies who arrived after an average gestation of about 30 weeks at an average birth weight of 1,300 grams (2.9 pounds).    Researchers also followed a control group of 227 parents of healthy infants who arrived at an average gestation of more than 39 weeks and with an average weight of 3,374 grams (7.4 pounds)   All of the babies were born in Germany in 1985 and 1986. Researchers did seven assessments of the babies and parents from birth to adulthood.   As expected, the preemies had more difficulties early on.    For example, 39 percent of the underweight and preterm infants had disabilities, compared with about 6 percent of the full-term babies. The preemies also did worse in school.   When children were in their late 20s, researchers asked parents to fill out quality-of-life surveys assessing their own physical and mental health as well as things like their social life and financial resources.   Overall, parents of the adult preemies had life satisfaction scores similar to the parents of healthy infants, researchers report in Pediatrics.    One limitation of the study is that many of the parents of preemies dropped out by the end, the authors note.    Because children’s mental health and peer relationships did impact parents’ quality of life, families might want to consider counseling to encourage social engagement for kids who struggle in these areas, said Dr. Nigel Paneth, a researcher at Michigan State University in East Lansing who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Children with disabilities are often left out of activities, and it takes extra parental effort to bring them into the fuller social engagement with their peers that they deserve,” Paneth said by email. “This might also reduce the mental health burden.”   Support for parents of preemies is crucial, too, said Dr. Saroj Saigal, a pediatrics researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It is extremely important for parents of preemies to be supported in the neonatal intensive care unit and after discharge by health professionals and experts in the area of mental health,” Saigal said by email. “Support from friends and families are also crucial.”   Parents of preemies might be just as satisfied as parents of healthy kids by the time children are grown because their preterm infants wound up doing better than expected, said Trond Nordheim, a psychologist at Akershus University Hospital in Lorenskog, Norway who wasn’t involved in the study.    The take-home message with preemies?    “It may be tough at first, but it will be ok,” Nordheim said by email.   "
2upiwpm,2017-08-10,Access may explain some social disparities in U.S. water intake," (Reuters Health) - Black and Hispanic adults in the U.S. have higher rates of mild dehydration than whites, and one reason may be less access to safe, clean tap water, researchers say.   Since getting enough water is important for health, policy action is needed to ensure equitable access to healthy beverages including tap water, the study team writes in the American Journal of Public Health.   “Hydration is essential for maintaining proper physiological functioning, and mild levels of inadequate hydration, such as when a person begins to feel thirsty, can impair daily functioning and well-being with symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, reduced cognitive functioning, poorer physical performance, and headaches,” lead author Carolyn Brooks told Reuters Health in an email.   In 2015, her co-authors on the current study published results documenting inadequate hydration among kids in the U.S. and found some striking disparities, said Brooks, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.   “These findings drove us to want to explore whether a similar pattern would emerge in the U.S. adult population.”   The ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and other research showing racial, ethnic and socioeconomic differences in tap water intake also prompted the study team to investigate the idea that these might play a role in hydration and dehydration patterns, Brooks added.   The researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected during 2009 to 2010 and 2011 to 2012 for adults aged 20 to 74 years.   They focused on measurements of urine concentrations to determine hydration levels, and also took into account age, gender, race, ethnicity, income levels and overall dietary intakes.    Drinks were categorized as either plain water, including tap water, sugar-sweetened beverages, milk, 100-percent juice, diet beverages, tea, coffee or alcoholic beverages.   On average, the study team found, non-Hispanic white adults drank about 3.5 servings of tap water every day while non-Hispanic black adults drank about 2 servings per day and Hispanic adults drank about 2.3 servings.   Blacks and Hispanics were 44 percent and 42 percent, respectively, more likely to be inadequately hydrated compared to their white counterparts. People with lower incomes were also more likely to be inadequately hydrated compared to higher income individuals.   “We found that nearly a third (29.5 percent) of U.S. adults are not adequately hydrated at a given time and that this was not equal by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.”   It’s important to distinguish that our team looked at “inadequate hydration,” not extreme dehydration which is associated with more serious health problems that can require immediate attention, she noted.   Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults drank more bottled water but fewer diet drinks and plain coffee or tea when compared to non-Hispanic whites.     “We found that differences in tap water intake did partially explain the racial/ethnic disparities in hydration status. And differences in consumption of other beverages further explained some of the racial/ethnic and income disparities,” Brooks said.    Though many beverages and moisture from food can improve hydration status, they do not all have the same health and financial benefits as safe tap water, Brooks said.    “Tap water is generally low cost and calorie free - unlike purchasing sugar-sweetened beverages, which pose additional economic burdens and have other health risks given their well-documented relationship to obesity and diabetes.”   More research is needed, she added. “While our study suggests a link between racial/ethnic disparities in drinking tap water and disparities in hydration status, we can’t say for sure that differences in safe tap water access are really driving this.”   Encouraging people to drink more tap water may seem simple enough, Brooks said, but in many communities of color, there are both real and perceived concerns regarding the safety of water.    “Therefore, it is important that we not only focus on initiatives that promote healthy and affordable beverages, but also work to assess and improve drinking water infrastructure in areas with poor access, and improve perceptions of tap water where appropriate,” she said.

2vTqE5h,2017-08-10,Glucosamine supplements don’t help knee or hip arthritis pain," (Reuters Health) - Oral glucosamine, a natural supplement often marketed for joint pain, has no more effect than a dummy pill, according to a new review of available research.   The analysis of randomized controlled trials from which data have been made public found that at both three-month and 24-month follow-up points, the supplement had no effect on either hip or knee pain from arthritis.   Even analyses of the results for sub-groups of study participants, such as overweight people or those with high inflammation, found no benefit with the supplements.    “Most recent guidelines conclude there is an overall lack of efficacy of glucosamine, however, we knew that osteoarthritis could affect subgroups differently,” said senior study author Sita Bierma-Zeinstra of Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.   The most recent report from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics found that Americans spent nearly $13 billion in 2012 on natural product supplements, and glucosamine was one of the most popular.    The Osteoarthritis Research Society International and the U.S. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recently issued guidance about the lack of evidence for glucosamine as a cure for joint pain.    “Before we threw the baby out with the bathwater, however, it was important to know whether different subgroups could have some effect,” Bierma-Zeinstra told Reuters Health by email.   The researchers analyzed data from randomized, controlled trials conducted between 1994 and 2014. Of the 21 studies they found on the subject, only six shared data through the OA Trial Bank, an international collection of data from trials conducted worldwide. None of the trials included in the analysis was funded by industry, the authors note.   Five of the trials, which altogether included more than 1,600 patients, compared glucosamine with a placebo. Five of the six studies investigated knee osteoarthritis, and one looked at hip osteoarthritis.   Overall, the effects of glucosamine and the placebo on pain and physical functioning didn’t differ, either in the short-term or one or two years later. The supplement was also no better than placebo among subgroups based on pain severity, severity of osteoarthritis, age, body mass index, gender or signs of inflammation.   “Of course, the most striking thing in this study is that when a commercial party funded the source, data sharing became difficult,” Bierma-Zeinstra said. “Open access to data from clinical studies, although propagated by many research organizations worldwide, is still far from common practice.”   In addition, the researchers found that data for a study published in 2006 was no longer available. Although data from older studies may disappear, that doesn’t often happen with recent ones, she added.   The research team plans to update subgroup data in the OA Trial Bank every five years. They’ll continue to contact clinical trial researchers to encourage them to contribute data to the project.   Future studies should look more closely at knee versus hip osteoarthritis and specific supplement types such as glucosamine sulfate versus glucosamine hydrochloride, the Bierma-Zeinstra’s team writes in the Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.    “Consumers should be cautious about spending money on unproven treatments,” said Dr. C. Kent Kwoh, director of the University of Arizona Arthritis Center in Tucson.    For instance, side effects of glucosamine include heartburn, drowsiness, headaches, allergic reactions, weight gain, diarrhea and abdominal pain, said Kwoh, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Most consumers believe that, as a ‘natural product,’ glucosamine is safe, but there are potential side effects,” he told Reuters Health by email. “There is very little evidence that oral glucosamine is beneficial for pain.”  "
2vqPEi7,2017-08-10,Economic status tied to blood vessel health in kids," (Reuters Health) - Economic challenges in childhood may be linked to the early development of thicker artery walls that are known to underlie many cases of cardiovascular disease, according to a new study from Australia.   Compared to kids from wealthier backgrounds, kids from low-income families and neighborhoods had thicker walls in the carotid arteries that provide blood to the brain.   The buildup of plaque and cells on the inner lining of arteries - known as the intima-media - narrows the passage for blood and is called atherosclerosis, said Dr. David Burgner of Melbourne University.   “So the intima-media thickness of the carotid artery is a good measure of the extent of atherosclerosis and it is easily measured by an ultrasound of the neck, even in young children,” Burgner told Reuters Health in an email. “In adults, carotid intima-media thickness is used clinically to assess the risk of future cardiovascular disease.”   Atherosclerosis can affect any artery. In the coronary arteries, advanced atherosclerosis can lead to heart attacks. In the carotid arteries, it can lead to stroke.   For the new study, children from 1,477 families were recruited into the study before their first birthday and examined every two years starting in 2004. The thickness of the children’s carotid intima-media was evaluated in 2015.   When the researchers divided the children into four groups according to their family’s economic background, they found that the most economically disadvantaged children were 46 percent more likely than children from the wealthiest families to have the thickest intima-media measurements.   The increased thickness means those children’s veins work as if they’re at least eight years older than they really are, the research team writes in the Journal of the American Heart Association.   Neighborhood economics were also tied to the condition of the children’s artery walls, researchers found.   Social and economic status as a toddler was tied to the risk of thick artery walls as a adolescent.   “It was striking that the socioeconomic status so early in life was associated with increased carotid intima-media thickness by mid-childhood; this is not an age when cardiovascular disease risk is often considered,” said Burgner, who is also affiliated with Murdoch Childrens Research Institute and Monash Childrens Hospital.   He emphasized that the new study can’t say whether poverty causes children to have thicker intima-media.    Nor can it predict if these children will have heart problems or strokes later on.   “However, given the wealth of other work in adults, our findings add to the consensus that social inequality may have broad adverse health consequences from an early age,” said Burgner. “For individual families, minimizing the known risks for cardiovascular disease – regular exercise, healthy diet, not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight etc – remain the cornerstone of prevention.”  "
2wJbGMo,2017-08-09,Poor Medicare patients may spend more on hospital stays," Out-of-pocket spending for hospital care by people with Medicare may be higher for those with lower incomes, because they’re more likely than wealthier Medicare beneficiaries to be kept in the hospital without being officially admitted, a new study suggests.    Under Medicare, the government insurance program for the elderly and disabled, people admitted to the hospital pay a fixed out-of-pocket fee that covers the majority of their care there, as well as follow-up acute nursing care and repeat hospitalizations within the first two months after they go home.   But people who aren’t sick enough for an inpatient admission may be kept in the hospital for observation, which not only carries a one-time out-of-pocket fee but also requires patients to pay 20 percent of the bills for hospital services and pick up the tab for certain drugs.    The poorest people on Medicare had more hospitalizations for observation, researchers found.    For the study, they examined Medicare claims data for 2013, including more than 67,000 patients who had a total of more than 132,000 hospital stays for observation.   Compared with the wealthiest 25 percent of patients, the people in the poorest quartile were 24 percent more likely to be hospitalized for at least three observation stays per year, the study found. The risk of high out-of-pocket costs was lowest for the wealthiest patients, and peaked for people who were poor, but not the very poorest.    “We know from prior work that multiple observation stays can lead to high out-of-pocket costs for Medicare beneficiaries,” said lead study author Dr. Jennifer Goldstein, a researcher with Christiana Care Hospitalist Partners and Sidney Kimmel Medical College in Philadelphia.    “To our knowledge, this is the first nationally representative study to find that beneficiaries who are least able to afford it may be at greatest risk for incurring these high costs,” Goldstein said by email.    Overall, people in the study had an estimated average household income of $51,872.   The study included 97 percent of counties nationwide. Researchers sorted Medicare members based on the proportion of people living in poverty in their county of residence. In the wealthiest counties, 12.2 percent of residents lived in poverty, whereas poverty rates were above 19.1 percent in the poorest counties.    One limitation of the study is that researchers couldn’t account for which patients might have qualified for additional medical coverage through Medicaid, the U.S. health program for the poor, or through so-called Medigap plans people can buy to cover expenses not paid by Medicare.    “While it makes sense that the higher use of observation stays for persons with lower socioeconomic status is associated with higher charges, it is likely that much of these higher costs would be covered by Medicaid,” said Dr. Kumar Dharmarajan, a researcher at Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “After accounting for Medicaid contributions, it is actually conceivable that persons with low socioeconomic status actually have lower total out-of-pocket payments,” Dharmarajan, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Still, the study highlights differences in out-of-pocket costs for observation versus inpatient hospital stays that patients may not understand, said Dr. Ann Sheehy, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison who wasn’t involved in the study.    More research is needed to make it easier for patients to grasp, Sheehy said by email.    “No study to date has been able to compare cost of inpatient to (observation) stays for the exact same set of services and hospital length of stay, and none have been able to account for all costs a patient may incur,” Sheehy said. “As a physician, I cannot accurately tell the patient I am caring for what they will pay for an observation hospitalization compared to inpatient.”  "
2wIm2MH,2017-08-09,"Can new tool make cervical biopsy more efficient, less painful?"," Women undergoing cervical biopsies might have lower odds of repeat tests with a rotating fabric brush than a sharp instrument because the soft device may capture more cells for analysis, a recent study suggests.    Furthermore, biopsies with the softer tool may be less painful, researchers say.   Cervical biopsies sometimes fail to collect enough cells from the cervix to accurately test for cancer, in which case another biopsy is needed.    For the new study, researchers compared data on 9,234 biopsy specimens collected with an older, sharp hooked device that scrapes cells from inside the cervix to data from 774 specimens obtained with a newer, fabric alternative. With the sharp instruments, 4.2 percent of the specimens didn’t have enough cells to adequately test for cervical cancer, compared with 0.6 percent of specimens collected with the fabric brush.   “The fabric-based device takes a biopsy that is larger which allows pathologists to have a better chance of finding abnormal cells,” lead study author Dr. Justin Diedrich of the University of California, Riverside, said by email.    As reported in the Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease, Diedrich and colleagues examined data on lab results before and after 81 doctors and nurses switched from using sharp instruments to a fabric alternative.    This included biopsies done in 2010 and 2011 using an older, sharp device known as a Kevorkian curette as well as biopsies done in from 2011 to 2013 using an alternative fabric brush instrument made by Histologics LLC, a tissue-sampling company that provided funding for the study.    The fabric hook has material, similar to the rough side of Velcro, that scrapes for tissue samples. This option may be less painful for women than conventional sharp instruments, the study authors write.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether the fabric-based alternative is safer, more effective or more comfortable than sharp instruments. Researchers also didn’t examine outcomes for women after they got the biopsy results to see how many of them actually required repeat biopsies.   “This paper cannot make a comparison of accuracy between the two different methods,” said Dr. Christina Chu, a gynecologic oncology specialist at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study.    Because the fabric brush is a single-use device, while the sharp instrument can be used repeatedly, costs are different, Chu said by email. While the Kevorkian sharp curette costs $40 to $50, it can be sterilized and used hundreds of times, compared to a $3.75 cost for every single-use fabric brush.   Getting vaccinated for human papilloma virus (HPV), which causes cervical cancer, and getting Pap tests to screen for tumors can help prevent malignancies from developing and improve the odds of catching cancer early if it does develop.    The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get two doses of the HPV vaccine at least six months apart when they are 11 to 12 years old. Teens and young adults who get their first shot at ages 15 through 26 years should get three doses of the HPV vaccine.    The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends a Pap test every three years for women aged 21 to 29, and every five years from ages 30 to 65.   "
2wIDQqQ,2017-08-09,"Underground safe haven keeps drug users off street, may save lives"," Reuters Health - While policymakers continue to block supervised injection sites in the U.S., a nonprofit secretly opened an unlicensed five-booth facility where visitors shoot up heroin and other drugs under the watchful eye of trained staff.   The clandestine operation – the first disclosed in the U.S. – probably saved the lives of two visitors in two years when staffers used the medication naloxone to reverse their overdoses, according to an American Journal of Preventive Medicine report by researchers who evaluated the facility.   Lead author Alex Kral called the privately funded social services organization’s opening of the unsanctioned site in a hidden urban location an act of “civil disobedience.”    Operators of the underground program opened the site in September 2014 after they tired of waiting for legislators to sanction supervised injection facilities, Kral said in a phone interview.    “They basically said, ‘We’ve got too many people dying,’” he said. A San Francisco-based epidemiologist, Kral directs the behavioral and urban health program at RTI International, a nonprofit research institute with headquarters in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.    An estimated 100 drug users injected themselves 2,574 times in the hidden site in its first two years, according to statistics Kral and his co-author Peter Davidson of the University of California, San Diego, compiled from anonymous and confidential surveys.    The vast majority were homeless white men who injected heroin purchased elsewhere. If not for the unsanctioned injection facility, most of the site’s visitors told researchers they would have shot up in a park, public restroom, street or parking lot.   As far as Kral knows, the facility he evaluated is the only one of its kind in the U.S., though 11 other countries, including Canada, have authorized supervised injection sites.   Since the first supervised injection facility opened in the Swiss city of Berne in 1986, about 100 similar facilities began operating in 66 cities across 11 countries.    As public health officials have wrestled with the fallout from a growing opioid epidemic, U.S. cities from Seattle to New York have considered allowing supervised injection sites. But no U.S. city or county has been able to clear the political and legal hurdles.    Overdose deaths killed more than 52,000 people in the U.S. in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    Dr. Alex Walley, a Boston Medical Center addiction specialist who was not involved with the new study, said the findings illustrate the benefits of supervised injection sites.    “In the midst of the opioid crisis, which is hitting the United States harder than any other country now, we need to use every tool that’s working,” he said in phone interview.    “Not everyone who has opioid-use disorder wants treatment,” he said. “It’s really important that we keep people safe and alive until they come into treatment.”   Critics object to enabling addicts to flout laws about illicit drugs and say injection facilities could thwart efforts to treat and prevent drug use. Advocates, however, contend that the sites save lives, prevent needle-sharing diseases like HIV, and steer drug users into treatment.   Advocates also argue that supervised sites help communities by keeping drug users out of public places, where they can leave dangerous refuse, unnerve passersby, and disturb businesses.   Some restaurant managers and librarians have begun to keep naloxone on hand because people regularly overdose in their bathrooms, Walley said.    In a prior study, Kral estimated that a 13-booth supervised injection facility in San Francisco could save $3.5 million a year, mostly in reduced medical costs.    To avoid telltale lines, the unsanctioned site allows access to fewer than 60 people at a time. Employees of the social services agency that runs the facility must invite visitors to the site, which is open four to six hours a day five days a week.   The facility consists of two rooms, one with five stainless steel injection stations equipped with mirrors and stools, and an adjoining room for post-injection monitoring.   The facility is tiny compared to similar facilities elsewhere in the world. In Vancouver, for example, in just three days, drug users inject the same number of needles - about 2,500 - as injected within two years at the unsanctioned site, Kral said.    Unsanctioned and unsupervised injection sites are popping up all over the nation, including in an abandoned church in Philadelphia, said Leo Beletsky, a professor of law and health sciences at Northeastern University School of Law in Boston, who was not involved with the research.   Plumbers frequently are summoned to fix public restroom pipes clogged with discarded syringes, he said in a phone interview.   “We need to transition from having these spaces be hidden and unsafe to being open and safe,” he said. “We can’t go on pretending this is not happening.”  "
2umgXJ6,2017-08-08,Ibuprofen linked to slight risk of kidney damage in ultramarathoners," (Reuters Health) - Ultramarathoners who manage race day pain with ibuprofen are a bit more likely to develop kidney injuries than their competitors who don’t use the drug, a small experiment suggests.   The difference in the odds of kidney damage wasn’t big enough to be statistically meaningful, and at least some of the added risk may be associated with dehydration, researchers report in the Emergency Medicine Journal. But it’s possible one in every 5.5 ultramarathoners using ibuprofen, in a family of medicines known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), might experience acute kidney injuries, researchers conclude.    “In endurance events, there are multiple factors at play that may cause acute kidney injury,” said lead study author Dr. Grant Lipman of Stanford University School of Medicine in California.   “There is dehydration, which decreases renal blood flow, and also the breakdown of muscle fibers which can clog the kidneys’ filtering mechanism and lead to renal failure,” Lipman said by email. “The concern is that the hit of NSAID-induced decreased renal blood blow may add to the ‘perfect storm’ of events.”   In acute kidney injury, the kidneys are no longer able to filter waste products from blood. The condition is common in endurance runners, the study team writes in the Emergency Medicine Journal, and in most cases it resolves by itself.    For the study, researchers randomly assigned 89 elite athletes to take either 400 milligrams of ibuprofen or a dummy pill known as a placebo every four hours during a 50-mile foot race. At the end of the race, researchers measured creatinine in the runners’ blood to detect kidney injury.   Overall, 22 runners taking ibuprofen, or 52 percent, developed acute kidney injury, compared with 16 athletes, or 34 percent, with the placebo.    While that suggests kidney damage might be about twice as likely with ibuprofen than without it, the difference wasn’t big enough to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.   Other studies have linked NSAIDs to an increased risk of acute kidney disease in healthy people who aren’t athletes. For every 100,000 NSAID users, one will develop kidney problems, previous research suggests, translating into upwards of 2.5 million cases annually.    Because endurance athletes have more risk of kidney damage than other individuals, the risks of NSAIDs may outweigh the benefits, the study authors conclude.    Ultramarathoners should use NSAIDs with caution, said Dr. Elliott Antman, a researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.    “The basic message is avoid NSIADs if possible,” Antman said by telephone. “If you have to take them, take the smallest dose required to relieve whatever discomfort develops and take it for the shortest possible period of time.”   Another option is acetaminophen, a pain reliever that’s processed by the liver, not the kidneys, said Dr. Karen M. Sutton, a researcher at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, who wasn’t involved in the study.    Good hydration is also key, Sutton said by email.    “Ultramarathoners who are faster or suffer greater water weight loss during the run have a higher incidence of acute kidney injury,” Sutton said. “It would be important to stay very well hydrated during the run if one does take NSAIDs.”   Even some people who aren’t endurance athletes may eventually experience severe kidney damage from routine, long-term use of NSAIDs, noted Dr. Liffert Vogt, a researcher at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands who wasn’t involved in the study.   “The findings of this study are not only relevant for ultramarathon runners,” Vogt said by email.    “The study shows that anyone who is at risk for dehydration, for instance a senior in a nursing home during a hot summer, may suffer from a much higher risk for kidney failure when using NSAIDs,” Vogt added. “The same is true when someone gets dehydrated by a stomach flu with diarrhea and also uses NSAIDS.”  "
2wF9xRQ,2017-08-08,"Undocumented immigrants less likely to be arrested for drugs, alcohol"," (Reuters Health) - New research contradicts politicians’ claims that undocumented immigrants are prone to criminal trespasses.   As the percentage of immigrants without papers rose in the U.S. population between 1990 and 2014, arrests for drugs and drunken-driving dropped, according to a study in the American Journal of Public Health.    “The results of this study challenge the notion that undocumented immigrants cause higher crime rates and general chaos in our communities,” said Josefina Alvarez, a psychology professor at Adler University in Chicago, who was not involved with the research.   In the first study of its kind, researchers used immigration estimates from the Center for Migration Studies and the Pew Research Center to test the premise that those who entered the U.S. unlawfully placed the public at greater risk by driving under the influence and using illegal drugs.   Contrary to the rhetoric, with every 1 percent increase in the proportion of undocumented immigrants in a population of 100,000, there were 42 fewer drunken-driving arrests, 22 fewer drug arrests and roughly one less drug overdose, the study found.    Researchers found no difference in the frequency of drunken-driving deaths.    “The debate, both public and political, has far outpaced the research,” said Michael Light, a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin - Madison who led the study while at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.   “Our study takes a step toward informing these debates with the available data, which says that as the prevalence of undocumented immigrants increases in society, the prevalence of drug and alcohol problems do not increase in tandem,” he said in a phone interview. “In fact, the data seem to suggest the opposite.”   The study cites politicians’ claims about undocumented immigrants jeopardizing the health and safety of citizens starting in 2006, when an Iowa congressman claimed that 13 Americans died daily as a result of undocumented drunken drivers.    During the 2016 presidential campaign, Senator Ted Cruz promised to build a border wall, which he said would end the nation’s drug epidemic, and President Donald Trump vowed to erect a wall to protect against “bad hombres.”   “We think these conversations are too important to have in the absence of evidence,” Light said. “If you want to fight the opioid epidemic or reduce drunk driving, deporting undocumented immigrants residing in the U.S. is likely not going to be the most effective policy.”   The number of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. tripled from an estimated 3.5 million in 1990 to an estimated 10.9 million in 2014. At the same time, violent crime rates fell by half, giving pause to arguments that unlawful immigrants increase violent crime, Light said.   Although his study links an increase in undocumented immigration with a decrease in drug and alcohol arrests, it does not establish a causal relationship between the two.   But Alvarez said the new study supports previous evidence that immigrants tend to be law-abiding.    “Although we don’t have as much research on undocumented immigrants as we would like to have, there is plenty of research showing that immigrants in general are less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol than native-born citizens,” she said in an email.    Fear of police surveillance and deportation may deter undocumented immigrants from drinking and driving, or driving at all, Light and his co-authors write.   Alvarez has studied drug and alcohol use among Latinos in the U.S. and has seen a phenomenon dubbed the “immigrant paradox” - immigrants living under stressful conditions in poor, crime-ridden communities are less likely to drink alcohol and do illegal drugs, she said.   The “healthy immigrant thesis” or “Latino paradox” may explain the new study’s findings, Light said.    “When you look at things we think of as predictive of criminal behavior and poor health outcomes - low levels of education, few economic assets, immigrants tend to be engaging in less crime and staying healthier than we would expect,” he said.  "
2vJ8jry,2017-08-08,Few U.S. gun owners get training that includes suicide prevention," Reuters Health - About 61 percent of firearm owners in the U.S. have received formal training in handling their guns, but only one in seven say it included prevention of suicide - the number one cause of gun deaths, according to a new study.   “Medical experts, public health professionals, and the majority of American people strongly support the importance of all aspects of firearm safety,” said lead author Dr. Ali Rowhani-Rahbar of the University of Washington School of Public Health in Seattle.    This was the first national study in two decades that assessed the scope of firearm training in the U.S., he told Reuters Health by email. “The percentage of gun owners with formal firearm training hasn’t meaningfully changed since then,” when it was 56 percent.    Rowhani-Rahbar and colleagues created a web-based survey that included questions about firearm ownership, storage, training and use. Nearly 4,000 adults answered the survey, which excluded people on active military duty.   The survey asked about details of training, including whether it included information on safe handling, safe storage and preventing firearm accidents, theft and suicide. It also asked about types of firearms owners had, political views, veteran status, and the presence of children in the home.   The research team found that one in four people who completed the survey and three in five firearm owners said they had received formal firearm training.    About 14 percent of non-owners living with a firearm owner and 13 percent of those not living with a firearm owner had received training.    Among gun owners, 66 percent of men and 49 percent of women had received training.   Those who owned more than one firearm, owned both hand guns and long guns, had a concealed carry permit, or who said they had carried a loaded gun in the past month were more likely to have had training.    Those who owned a firearm for protection only, versus for hunting or sport, were less likely to have formal training, according to the results in Injury Prevention.   Safe handling was the most common topic covered in training, with 61 percent of gun owners saying it had been included in their training. In contrast, suicide prevention was the least common topic - just 14 percent of gun owners said it had been part of their training.    “The low percentage of non-owners living in a gun-owning household who have received training is important due to the strong relationship between presence of guns in households and risk of firearm injury and death for all members of the household,” Rowhani-Rahbar said.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, two-thirds of firearm deaths in the U.S. are suicides, the study team notes.   The low percentage of owners who have received training in suicide prevention is notable because there is a strong association between gun access and suicide, said Dr. Emmy Betz, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora.   “How do we reach the people who own firearms?” she said in a phone interview. “How do we work together in ways that are respectful and collaborative to prevent unintentional and accidental shootings?”   Betz, who wasn’t involved in the study, coordinates gun safety nights tailored to specific groups. At Ladies Night at Centennial Gun Club in Centennial, Colorado, for example, women meet twice a month to practice shooting and discuss suicide prevention.    “Working in the emergency room, I see different gunshot wounds related to domestic violence, suicide and accidents,” she said. “It’s important to remember there are different kinds of firearm injuries and deaths.”   Ladies Night focuses on safe storage and teen suicide, for example, but other programs run by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the NH Firearm Safety Coalition target inner-city violence or middle-aged workers who are depressed and at risk for suicide.    “Every firearm death is tragic, and both firearm owners and non-owners should know about safe storage, self-protection and suicide,” Betz said. “As individuals in communities, we can work together on this and set aside the divisive national debate about firearms.”  "
2vAuu40,2017-08-04,Free lock boxes tied to safer gun storage in family homes," (Reuters Health) - Giving away free lock boxes for gun storage may lead more families to store firearms safely away from children, a recent study suggests.    The researchers examined data on gun and ammunition storage habits in about 200 households before and after a community education program on firearm safety that offered participants free firearm lock boxes or trigger locks.    Overall, the proportion of participants who said all ammunition and firearms in the house were stored locked, and unloaded, climbed from 33 percent before the education program and lock giveaway to 46 percent afterward.   “Storing firearms safely, including keeping them locked and unloaded, is effective for preventing unintentional firearm injuries and suicides - especially among children and adolescents,” said lead study author Dr. Joseph Simonetti of the VA Rocky Mountain Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical Center at the Denver VA Medical Center in Colorado.   “The average person living in a home with a firearm is more likely to sustain an unintentional or self-inflicted firearm injury than be a victim of a firearm-related assault or homicide,” Simonetti said by email.    Simonetti and colleagues looked for changes in household firearm practices before and after community outreach events around Seattle, Washington in 2015.    Overall, 53 percent of the participants had a child under 18 in the household, and slightly more than a third of them had a child under 11 in their home.   Educators at the events demonstrated how to use firearm lock boxes and trigger locks and also explained some of the risks associated with improper gun and ammunition storage. To prevent injuries or suicide attempts, they also encouraged removal of guns from the home when a member of the household is depressed or has a substance abuse problem.    Prior to the event, 52 percent of participants said they used a firearm safe at home, while 29 percent used a cable lock, 21 percent had trigger locks and 20 percent had a firearm lock box.    At the event, nearly nine in ten participants said they would prefer to take home a free lock box, not a trigger lock.    Afterward, 75 percent of participants said they used the device they got at the event to store a household firearm, researchers report in Injury Prevention.   Limitations of the study include the reliance on participants to accurately report and recall how they stored guns and ammunition before and after attending safety events, as well as the lack of a control group of gun owners who didn’t attend the event that might help show how much the event was directly responsible for any changes in storage habits.    Even so, the findings offer fresh evidence that educating families and giving them free storage options may help more of them store guns safely, said Dr. Ruth Abaya of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.   “Knowledge about safe storage has been available for some time,” Abaya, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “We must determine the most effective messengers to ensure that the message is received and trusted.”   Too often, people don’t want to lock guns because they don’t think accidents will happen and they want their firearms immediately available and ready to use, said David Schwebel of the University of Alabama at Birmingham.   “But accidents can happen to anyone, and storing firearms that are unlocked and loaded is extremely dangerous,” Schwebel, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Accidents happen every day, and tragic unintentional deaths and injuries occur.”  "
2vJ8aVL,2017-08-07,Hospital patients don&#039;t get good data on nursing homes," (Reuters Health) - Patients in U.S. hospitals who need to be transferred to a nursing home are often left to choose a facility without the benefit of important information, suggests a new study.   In many cases, patients only receive lists of nearby facilities, without comprehensive and publicly available information about their quality, researchers found.   “They’re pretty much just given a list of the skilled nursing facilities in the city and expected to pick among them on their own without information about where they could even get that information,” said lead author Denise Tyler, a senior researcher at RTI International in Waltham, Massachusetts.   Tyler and colleagues interviewed 138 staff members at 16 hospitals and 25 skilled nursing facilities in eight states in 2015. They also interviewed 98 patients at 14 skilled nursing facilities. All patients were on Medicare, which is the publicly funded health insurance program for older or disabled people.   While the interviews were spread across several states, the patients provided “strikingly similar comments,” according to the researchers. Patients had received a list of nearby nursing facilities, but not much else.   Only four patients reported receiving any information about nursing facilities’ quality or where to find that information.    Interviews with staff supported the patients’ reports, the research team wrote in Health Affairs.   Hospitals cited legal restrictions and an emphasis on patient choice as the reasons why they could not supply patients with additional data about nursing facilities.   Tyler said hospitals were taking an “extreme view” of the law protecting patient choice.   “Our take on it is that it’s still possible to provide people with choice, but wouldn’t it be great if they could make an informed choice on information that currently exists?” she added.   Much of that information can be found on Nursing Home Compare, which is run by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( bit.ly/2vxulxM ). The site has detailed information about every Medicare- and Medicaid-certified nursing home in the country, including the facility's rating, health inspections, staffing and quality measures.   In addition to helping patients make an informed choice about their care, providing more information about nursing home quality is in the hospital’s interest, too, Tyler said.    For example, she noted, payments to the hospital from Medicare are tied to the proportion of patients who return to the hospital after discharge and are readmitted.   Providing the added information to those selecting a nursing facility seems like a “win-win” for both patients and hospitals, said Tyler.  "
2voOg1E,2017-08-04,"For older breast cancer survivors, unclear when to stop mammograms"," Reuters Health - Older breast cancer survivors who may not live long enough to benefit from routine mammograms are still often getting them, while some who do have more years ahead are not being screened, according to a U.S. study.   Most guidelines agree that when a woman has short life expectancy because of old age or serious health conditions, screening mammography is of little benefit and presents potential harms. But older breast cancer survivors and their doctors have little guidance to help decide when it’s time to stop the screening, researchers write in Journal of Clinical Oncology.    “Older women are often a forgotten group” in research, said lead author Dr. Rachel Freedman of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute at Harvard Medical School in Boston.   “We know very little about how often we should do mammography in older survivors and when it is OK to stop doing mammograms without a detriment in a women’s outcome,” she told Reuters Health by email. “It is likely that many women do not benefit from indefinite mammography as they age.”   About 70,000 American women over age 70 are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society. The American Cancer Society currently recommends that women without a history of breast cancer stop screening when their estimated life expectancy is under 10 years. Other organizations suggest older breast cancer survivors should stop if they have less than five years to live.   Using data from the National Health Interview Study, Freedman and colleagues identified 1,040 women over age 65 who reported a history of breast cancer and details on their health and mammograms in the prior 12 months.    Just over one third were age 80 or older and nearly nine out of 10 were white. The research team calculated each woman’s life expectancy based on age and overall health and estimated that about 9 percent had less than five years to live, and 35 percent had less than 10 years to live.   Overall, 79 percent of women had had a mammogram in the last year, and screening tended to decrease with life expectancy. But about 57 percent of women with less than five years to live had a mammogram, as did 66 percent of women who probably had less than 10 years to live. At the same time, 14 percent with more than 10 years to live didn’t receive a mammogram.   “We were surprised at the proportion of women with less than five years who reported having annual mammograms, as well as the 14 percent with excellent life expectancy who didn’t,” Freedman said. “This highlights the fact that we need to do better at tailoring who is getting (and not getting) this testing.”   In recent years, health care providers and policy experts have talked more about eliminating unnecessary cancer screenings among patients who are too old or sick to benefit, said Dr. Richard Hoffman of the University of Iowa in Iowa City, who wasn’t involved in the study. Ongoing testing can lead to false positives, overdiagnosis, overtreatment and procedure complications with little benefit in return.   “Undergoing tests looking for cancer can be very stressful, particularly for women who already have been diagnosed,” he told Reuters Health by email. “We don’t want to needlessly increase anxiety.”   At the same time, the lower number of women getting mammograms who have longer to live should be addressed as well, Hoffman added.   Doctors need to be aware of a patient’s overall health, he said, and “not deny an older patient appropriate preventive services just because they are older.”   More research is needed on the effect of screenings later in life, the study authors conclude. Also needed, they say, is a better decision-making process for patients to decide which screenings best fit them later in life.   “Making decisions about surveillance testing is challenging, as evidenced by the conflicting recommendations from professional organizations,” Hoffman said. “Ideally, doctors should be engaging patients and making decisions together.”  "
2u8WZFH,2017-08-04,Walking and biking tied to lower risk of hospitalization with sciatica,"  (This August 3rd story has been refiled to add dropped “of” to headline)   By Carolyn Crist   Reuters Health - Lifestyle factors like obesity and smoking are known to raise people’s risk of developing sciatica, but a new study finds that regular walking and biking may have an opposite, and just as powerful effect.   Researchers in Finland analyzed data on more than 35,000 people in that country who were followed for up to 30 years, and found that smoking and obesity each raised the risk of being hospitalized for sciatica by 33 percent or more, while regularly commuting on foot or by bicycle lowered the risk by 33 percent.   “The harmful effects of overweight, obesity and smoking, and the protective effect of walking or cycling to work on hospitalization are substantial,” said lead study author Dr. Rahman Shiri of the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health in Helsinki.   “These findings have important implications for prevention,” he told Reuters Health by email.   About 2 to 5 percent of people have sciatica, the authors note in the American Journal of Medicine. The painful condition typically results from a herniated disc in the lower back and a compressed nerve root, with shooting pain from the lower back along the sciatic nerve that extends down the back of the thighs and legs.    Sciatica rarely leads to surgery or hospitalization, but it’s considered one of the more long-lasting and severe low back pain syndromes, Shiri said.   The study team analyzed data from four long-term studies with a total of 34,589 participants and 1,259 hospitalizations for sciatica during 12-30 years of follow-up. They looked at risk factors such as smoking, body mass index, obesity, age, sex, education and occupation, as well as the frequency, intensity and duration of physical activity.   Although smoking increased the risk of hospitalization for sciatica by 33 percent, former smokers were not at increased risk. Obesity increased hospitalization risk by 36 percent, especially abdominal fat, which pushed the increase to 41 percent.    At the same time, commuting to work by walking or cycling reduced the risk by 33 percent, which was true happened regardless of body weight and other activity.    “Other types of leisure time physical activities had no effect on hospitalization,” Shiri added. “That was somewhat unexpected.”   Regular low-level physical activities such as walking and cycling may be helpful because they don’t strain the lower back, the study authors note, as opposed to higher-intensity exercise that may be harmful.    One limitation of the study is that it relies on self-reported data, and the researchers are unable to verify what other health factors were involved with hospitalization for sciatica. The studies also used different questions about leisure-time physical activity, and two surveys didn’t have enough information to distinguish between potential gender-related differences.    Future studies should analyze long-term data related to these factors and measure the physical activity directly, the study authors write.   “It could be, for example, that there is something else associated with smoking and independently makes people more likely to be admitted to the hospital for sciatica,” said David Coggon, a professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Southampton in the UK.    Perhaps more importantly, future studies should look at the major changes in back pain and sciatica occurrence over time, Coggon added. For example, long-term workplace absence due to low back pain has increased eightfold between the 1950s and 1970s, said Coggon, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “That said, there are plenty of other good reasons not to smoke, not to be obese, and to exercise,” Coggon said. Changing habits could have “practical implications for public health” for many disorders or diseases, he added.   "
2v341dP,2017-08-04,Low-nicotine cigarettes: misperceptions may not lessen benefits," (Reuters Health) - When cigarettes contain less nicotine, smokers see them as safer, because they equate the stimulant with smoking-related diseases. But that misperception doesn’t cancel out the potential benefits of low-nicotine cigarettes, a new study suggests.   In fact, while nicotine is addictive, it doesn’t lead to the health conditions caused by smoking. Heart attacks, lung cancer and respiratory conditions can be blamed on other cigarette additives like tar.   Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced plans to begin a public dialogue about lowering nicotine levels in cigarettes to non-addictive levels.    But some experts fear people may smoke more, or be less likely to quit, if they believe low-nicotine cigarettes are safer, said Lauren Pacek, of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.    Perceived nicotine content was indeed associated with perceived health risks in her team’s study, as reported in the journal Tobacco Control.   However, Pacek told Reuters Health, “on the positive side, we found perceived nicotine content wasn’t associated with smoking behavior.”   Smokers still wanted to stop smoking within a year even if they believed low-nicotine cigarettes to be less risky than traditional smokes.   The findings are drawn from participants in a 2015 study, in which people who smoked cigarettes with less nicotine ended up smoking less and having less exposure to nicotine.   For the six-week study, 839 daily smokers were randomly assigned to smoke either their usual cigarettes, or experimental cigarettes with varying levels of nicotine for six weeks.    Participants who smoked experimental cigarettes were unaware of the nicotine content. At the end of the study, about 34 percent thought they were smoking cigarettes with a very low nicotine level. About 36 percent thought the nicotine level was low, about 24 percent thought it was moderate and 6.8 percent thought it was high or very high.   Based on survey responses at the end of the study, Pacek and colleagues found that participants believed the health risks posed by the cigarettes increased with the level of nicotine.   But even if they believed that low-nicotine cigarettes are less harmful, people who thought they were smoking very low nicotine cigarettes were more likely to say they would quit within a year if those were the only cigarettes on the market, compared to people smoking cigarettes with low or moderate nicotine levels.   The study can’t say definitively that seeing low-nicotine cigarettes as safer won’t lead people to smoke more, said Pacek.   Her team has conducted a follow-up study, to see “if over the longer term these thoughts make a difference,” she said. “We should be able to dig into the data and look at that pretty soon.”  "
2wsRazk,2017-08-04,Exercise may reduce metabolic syndrome risk in workers who sit all day," (Reuters Health) - Regular exercise outside of work can reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome in people whose jobs have them sitting most of the time, according to a small study from Brazil.   “If you have a sedentary occupation, especially in a sitting position for hours, you should move yourself out of work at least 150 minutes per week in a moderate intensity to mitigate the detrimental effects of sedentary behavior at work,” Eduardo Caldas Costa from Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte in Natal told Reuters Health.   Sedentary behavior has been associated with an increased risk for metabolic syndrome - a cluster of unfavorable markers including abdominal obesity, high blood pressure and low HDL “good” cholesterol - which, in turn, is associated with an increased risk of developing heart disease and type 2 diabetes.    The researchers investigated whether Navy workers who spent about eight hours daily seated, mostly in administrative duties, had different risks for metabolic syndrome based on their activity levels outside of work.    All the workers were men, ranging in age from 26 to 42. Out of 502 workers included in the final analysis, 201, or 40 percent, did not achieve at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-vigorous activity. Nearly half, 48 percent, were overweight and almost 19 percent were obese.    After adjusting for age, time in the job, body mass index (BMI) and tobacco use, researchers found the sedentary workers who met the physical activity recommendations were only about half as likely to have metabolic syndrome, compared to those with lower activity levels.    Workers with higher activity levels were also less likely to have abdominal obesity, high blood pressure and low HDL.   Even those who increased their activity slightly (the “insufficiently active” group) had lower blood pressure than workers who remained sedentary off the job, researchers reported in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.    “Sedentary occupation workers should break up prolonged sitting time at work as much as they can in order to reduce the risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases,” Caldas Costa said by email. “Be involved in regular physical activity out of work, including leisure time, domestic activities, and active transportation (i.e., walking and/or cycling).”   Only the physically active group, he added, and not the insufficiently active group, had a reduced risk for metabolic syndrome compared to the sedentary group. “Therefore,” he said, “it seems that probably there is a minimum quantity of physical activity that can mitigate the detrimental effects of sedentary behavior at work.”   "
2wsZteB,2017-08-04,High-fat diet linked to lung cancer risk," (Reuters Health) - People who eat a lot of saturated fat - the “bad” kind of fat that’s abundant in foods like butter and beef - are more likely to develop lung cancer than individuals on low-fat diets, a recent study suggests.    Compared to adults who didn’t get a lot of fat in their diets, people who ate the most total fat and saturated fat were 14 percent more likely to get lung malignancies, the study found. For current and former smokers, the added risk of a high fat diet was 15 percent.   While the best way to lower the risk of lung cancer is to not smoke, “a healthy diet may also help reduce lung cancer risk,” said study co-author Danxia Yu of Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.    “Specifically, our findings suggest that increasing polyunsaturated fat intake while reducing saturated fat intake, especially among smokers and recent quitters, may (help prevent) not only cardiovascular disease but also lung cancer,” she said.   The American Heart Association recommends the Dietary Approaches To Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or a Mediterranean-style diet to help prevent cardiovascular disease. Both diets emphasize cooking with vegetable oils with unsaturated fats, eating nuts, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, fish and poultry, and limiting red meat and added sugars and salt.   “Those guidelines are the same for avoiding heart disease, stroke and diabetes, and I would say they are also exactly the same for helping with cancer prevention in general and lung cancer in particular,” said Dr. Nathan Berger, a researcher at Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center who wasn’t involved in the study.   “This doesn’t mean you need to throw away all the steak and butter in your freezer, but cutting back to once a week would be good for you,” Berger said in a phone interview.    For the current study, researchers examined data from 10 previously published studies in the United States, Europe and Asia that looked at how dietary fat intake influences the odds of lung malignancies.    Combined, the smaller studies had more than 1.4 million participants, including 18,822 with cases of lung cancer identified during an average follow-up of more than nine years.    Researchers sorted participants into five categories, from lowest to highest consumption of total and saturated fats. They also sorted participants into five groups ranging from the lowest to highest amounts of dietary unsaturated fats.    Overall, people who ate the most unsaturated fats were 8 percent less likely to develop lung cancer than people who ate the least amounts, researchers report in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.    Substituting five percent of calories from saturated fat with unsaturated fat was associated with a 16 percent lower risk of small cell lung cancer and 17 percent lower odds of another type of lung malignancy known as squamous cell carcinoma.    One limitation of the study is that dietary information was only obtained at one point, the authors note. This makes it impossible to track how changes in eating habits might influence the odds of cancer.    They also didn’t account for two other things that may contribute to cancer – sugar and trans fats, Glen Lawrence, a biochemistry researcher at Long Island University in Brooklyn, New York, said by email. Previous research has also found that unsaturated oils may increase the risk of certain cancers, added Lawrence, who wasn’t involved in the current study.    It’s also possible that other bad eating habits, not fat, contribute to the increased risk of lung cancer, said Ursula Schwab of the Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition at the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio.   “We need antioxidants, vitamins and minerals as well as unsaturated fatty acids,” Schwab, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “A typical Western diet has a low content of these essential nutrients and a high content of saturated fat.”  "
2vtIrk9,2017-08-03,Can a drink a day keep diabetes away?,"  (This version of the story corrects source’s title and affiliation in second-to-last paragraph)   By Lisa Rapaport   (Reuters Health) - People who enjoy one beer or glass of wine several days a week may be less likely to develop diabetes than drinkers who tend to have all their cocktails on a Saturday night, a Danish study suggests.    When researchers looked at people who drank they same total amount of alcohol, they found that men who spread those drinks over three to four days of the week were 27 percent less likely to develop diabetes than guys who downed all their shots and beers in one sitting.    Women, meanwhile, had 32 percent lower odds of diabetes when they spread their cocktails over several days instead of a single happy hour.    But this is hardly a prescription to drink every day, said senior study author Janne Tolstrup of the University of Southern Denmark.   “I wouldn’t advise a non-drinker to start drinking for their health,” Tolstrup said by email.    “Generally, people should stick to the guidelines already there,” which in most countries are a maximum of 7 drinks per week for women and 14 for men, Tolstrup added.    Other studies looking at total alcohol consumption have linked light to moderate drinking with a lower risk of diabetes than abstinence, researchers note in Diabetologia. The odds of diabetes for binge drinkers, meanwhile, had been similar to or greater than for teetotalers, previous research has found.    For the current study, researchers wanted to see how much the total amount of alcohol consumed over a week might help explain the differing pictures of diabetes risk found in earlier research.    They examined survey data from 70,551 men and women who didn’t have diabetes at the start of the study. Half the participants stayed in the study for five years or more.    During the study, 859 men and 887 women developed diabetes.   Like other studies of diabetes and drinking, the current analysis found the lowest risk for people who consumed moderate amounts of alcohol.    Compared to non-drinkers, men who had 14 drinks a week were 43 percent less likely to develop diabetes and women who had nine weekly drinks were 58 percent less likely to develop diabetes.    The study didn’t include many people who reported binge drinking, and it didn’t find clear evidence to show whether excessive alcohol consumption might be good or bad from the standpoint of diabetes risk.    What people drank did appear to matter, however.    Participants who had at least seven glasses of wine a week were 25 to 30 percent less likely to develop diabetes than people who had no more than a single weekly glass.    Beer, however, only appeared to help men. Consuming one to six beers a week was associated with a 21 percent lower risk of diabetes than drinking less than one beer a week.    Spirits, meanwhile, didn’t appear to help at all and were associated with problems for women. When women had seven or more drinks with spirits each week, they were 83 percent more likely to develop diabetes than women who had less than one cocktail or shot of booze a week.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove if or how alcohol consumption influences the odds of developing diabetes.    Other limitations include the reliance on participants to accurately recall and report on their drinking habits, as well as the possibility that other lifestyle factors or individual characteristics other than drinking habits might explain why some people got diabetes.    “The take-home message is to be very skeptical of the idea that frequent alcohol protects against developing diabetes,” said Tim Stockwell, director of the Center for Addictions Research of British Columbia and a professor at the University of Victoria in Victoria, Canada.   “There are a number of health risks associated with even moderate alcohol use including multiple cancers of the digestive system as well as breast cancer and possibly prostate cancer,” Stockwell, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “People should use alcohol sparingly if they drink and do so for pleasure and not with the idea that it will have medicinal benefits.”  "
2u5ixi9,2017-08-03,Early help tied to better language skills in kids with hearing loss," (Reuters Health) - Children with permanent hearing loss may develop better language skills if they get hearing aids or cochlear implants while they’re still babies, an Australian study suggests.    For the study, researchers examined data on language abilities at age 5 for children born with permanent hearing loss who received similar interventions at different points in childhood.    Kids who received hearing aids at age 2 had worse language outcomes than kids who got the devices fitted when they were just 3 months old, the study found. Children who got cochlear implants at age 2 also had worse language outcomes than kids who got these devices when they were 6 months old.    “Access to auditory cues in speech and language paves the way for language learning,” said lead study author Teresa Ching of the National Acoustic Laboratories Australian Hearing and the HEARing Cooperative Research Center in Australia.   “The shorter the period of deprived access to sounds, which would be non-existent in the case with normal hearing, the higher likelihood for the child with hearing loss to develop language that is on par with his/her normal-hearing peers,” Ching said by email.    Universal newborn hearing screenings have become standard in Australia and much of the developed world, with the goal of catching and treating hearing loss earlier when there’s the greatest potential benefit, the researchers write in Pediatrics.    But in practice, there’s still wide variation in how soon children with permanent hearing loss may receive hearing aids to amplify sounds or cochlear implants to transmit sound signals to the brain in kids with damage in the inner ear.    For the current study, researchers examined language outcomes at age 5 for 350 children with permanent hearing loss as well as for a control group of 120 kids with normal hearing.    The kids with hearing loss were compared to children with similar types of impairment who got the same intervention - hearing aids or cochlear implants - at a different time. Children were also similar in the degree of hearing loss, birth weight, IQ, additional disabilities and mode of communication.   The impact of earlier intervention was more pronounced for children with more severe hearing impairment than for kids with milder hearing loss, the study found.    Universal newborn hearing tests, however, didn’t appear to influence language outcomes. This might be because not all kids who got tested as newborns received hearing interventions as infants, and some children who missed out on newborn tests still received hearing aids or implants as babies, the authors note.    One limitation of the study is that almost half of the eligible children invited to join the study didn’t enroll or didn’t remain in the study until they were 5 years old, the researchers point out. Some parents declined to participate, while in other cases kids turned out not to have permanent hearing loss or didn’t receive aids or implants until after their third birthday.    The low inclusion rate might explain why researchers didn’t detect an impact from universal newborn hearing tests, the authors conclude.    Screening to promptly detect and treat hearing loss results in the best listening and speaking outcomes, said Dimity Dornan, founder and executive director of Hear and Say, an nonprofit advocacy group in Brisbane, Australia.    “When a child with hearing loss receives appropriate hearing aids, the pathway to the brain is unlocked, allowing sound to reach the listening part of the brain,” Dornan, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “This opens the possibility for the rudimentary brain circuitry for listening that the baby is born with to change from little rutted country lanes into six-lane freeways, and sound messages can quickly reach the brain and be interpreted,” Dornan added. “If a child does not receive hearing aids until later, the listening brain is not optimally developed and the listening, understanding and acting/speaking cycle is laborious and slow.”  "
2w3evrs,2017-08-03,"For diabetics, aquatic exercise as good as working out on land"," (Reuters Health) - For people with type 2 diabetes, exercising in water is just as effective at improving blood sugar as other types of workouts, according to a review of existing research.   People who face obstacles in getting to a gym or exercising outdoors should consider hitting the pool to meet their exercise goals, the authors write in Acta Diabetologica.   Exercise helps lower blood sugar levels, which is a primary goal for diabetes management, but it also contributes to positive changes in body composition, blood pressure and cholesterol, and helps increase overall quality of life, the study authors note.   But only about 30 percent of people with type 2 diabetes adhere to a traditional exercise program that includes walking, running or resistance training.   “Our research group has conducted several exercise studies in people who have type 2 diabetes. We noticed that some people could not participate in our land-based (e.g., walking) studies due to barriers such as joint pain,” lead author Normand Boule told Reuters Health by email.   “We then planned to do a study on alternate forms of exercise which could address some of these barriers. Aquatic exercise seemed to be a logical alternative,” said Boule, a physical education and recreation researcher at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.   But when Boule and his colleagues looked for prior studies on this topic, they were surprised to find that not many water-based exercise studies had been done with people with type 2 diabetes.    “These studies had few participants, making it difficult to fully understand how water-based exercise may benefit individuals with type 2 diabetes,” he said, so they decided to pool the results in a so-called meta-analysis for a bigger picture.    They drew on nine previously published studies that examined aquatic exercises and blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. The water-based exercises included water walking or running, water cycling and various types of water-based fitness classes.    Two studies compared water exercise to land-based exercise directly. The rest compared water exercisers to similar but sedentary people, or compared individuals to themselves before starting an exercise regimen and after eight weeks or more of water exercise.   The researchers found that after eight weeks, water exercisers had reduced a marker of long-term blood sugar levels known as HbA1C by the same amount as people doing land-based exercise.   In addition, after 8 to 12 weeks of water-based exercise, individuals may have improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglycerides, Boule said.   There are some limitations to the analysis. Most of the studies were short-term, so more research is needed to see how water exercises compare with land-based exercises over time, Boule’s team writes.   While this study may be sufficient to show improved blood sugars, it would be important to conduct longer-term studies for several reasons, Boule said.   “First, adherence to longer-term exercise interventions is challenging; and challenges with access to a pool (e.g., costs, distance, program availability, etc.) may make adherence even more difficult than for other activities such as walking,” he said.   The second reason for longer-term study may be particularly relevant to people with lower-body limitations to exercise, such as joint paint, he said.   “With a longer-term study, improvements in fitness and reductions in joint pain may translate to increases in the ability to be physically active in other ways, outside of the pool setting. If so, water-based exercise may further assist in improving quality of life outcomes such as mental health and physical function,” Boule said.  "
2vj8wSu,2017-08-02,Stopping statins after stroke may increase second-stroke risk," (Reuters Health) - - Stopping cholesterol-lowering drugs soon after a stroke may increase the risk of a second stroke, according to a new study from Thailand.   People who stopped taking statin drugs within three to six months after a stroke were 42 percent more likely to have another stroke within a year, compared to people who kept taking the medication, researchers found.   “These findings suggest that providers and atherosclerotic stroke patients should not discontinue statin therapy unless there is a highly compelling reason for doing so,” write Dr. Meng Lee, of Chang Gung University College of Medicine, and colleagues in the Journal of the American Heart Association.   Nearly 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including 610,000 who are having a stroke for the first time.   Statins include the drugs atorvastatin, known commercially as Lipitor; rosuvastatin, also known as Crestor, and simvastatin, or Zocor.   They work by inhibiting the liver’s ability to produce cholesterol while also helping the liver remove existing fats in the blood, according to the CDC.   The drugs are almost universally prescribed to people who have had cardiovascular events like heart attacks or strokes. Additionally, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends the drugs to people ages 40 to 75 who don’t have heart disease but who do have one or more risk factors and a 10-year risk of a heart attack or stroke of at least 10 percent.   For the new study, researchers used data from 2001-2012 from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, which includes medical information for most people in the country.   They included 45,151 people who had an ischemic stroke, which is caused by a blocked blood vessel. All were prescribed a statin within 90 days of leaving the hospital.   After three to six months, 7 percent were on a reduced statin dose and 18.5 percent had been taken off the drugs entirely.   The researchers found that 6.2 percent of people who stopped taking statins ended up with another stroke within a year, compared to 4.4 percent of those who stayed on at least a moderate dose of the drugs.   There was no significant difference in risk between those who were on a reduce statin dose and those on at least a moderate dose.   The new results jibe with previous research, said Dr. Joshua Willey, who is a specialist in vascular neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York.   “This would argue even in the short term - even in the first year - stopping medication could have a potential harms,” said Willey, who was not involved with the new study.   He told Reuters Health that stroke patients often ask doctors about statin side effects or information they read online.   “I think the vast majority of patients in the U.S. when told why they need to do it are good at remaining on it,” said Willey.

2hnMBDT,2017-08-03,"Short sleep linked to body mass, waist size"," Getting one extra hour of sleep each night might shave a third of an inch off your waist and a couple of pounds off the number on the bathroom scale, a recent study suggests.   Among some 1,600 people in the UK, researchers found that those who slept more than eight hours a night had lower body mass index (BMI) - a measure of weight relative to height - and slightly smaller waists when compared to people who slept less than seven hours.   Longer sleepers also had slightly higher levels of HDL “good” cholesterol.     “Most of the findings are in line with what experimental sleep loss studies have shown. I think maybe a plus of this is that obviously it’s a much larger sample than something you would see in a laboratory,” Namni Goel, a sleep researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study.    For the study, published in PLoS One, Gregory Potter of the School of Medicine at the University of Leeds in West Yorkshire, and his colleagues analyzed four years’ of data from a national diet and nutrition survey that also tracks other health and lifestyle habits among people in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.    The available data included self-reported sleep records and food diaries for 1,615 adults, along with height and weight and blood pressure readings. In addition, about half of the participants agreed to provide blood samples so the study team could examine various measures of metabolic health such as cholesterol, blood sugar and thyroid hormone levels.   Researchers divided participants into three groups based on their average sleep duration. The bottom third had an average of 5.88 hours of sleep per night, with a range of plus or minus 52 minutes. The middle third had an average of 7.26 hours of sleep per night, plus or minus about 15 minutes, and the top third got an average of 8.44 hours of sleep at night, plus or minus 40 minutes.   The study team found that people in the top third for sleep duration had BMIs that were about two points lower – the equivalent of roughly 7 pounds (3.2 kilograms) – compared to people in the lowest third.    The longest sleepers also had waist circumferences averaging 1.6 inches (4 centimetres) smaller than the shortest sleepers.    Each extra hour of sleep was tied to a third of an inch (0.9 cm) difference in waist size and 0.46 of a BMI point, the study team reports.    There were slight improvements with more sleep in some blood markers, but after researchers adjusted for other factors, the differences were not statistically significant, meaning they could have been due to chance.   The study team also didn’t find any association between sleep duration and diet or calorie intake, although Goel noted that food and sleep diaries are often inaccurate.   There are currently ongoing studies trying to figure out the mechanisms behind sleep and weight issues, said Goel, but she thinks it’s clear the source of the weight gain is overeating.    “Some of it is that when people are sleep deprived, they tend to go for high calorie, fatty, good tasting foods, and one of the ideas behind that is that it may be that some of the reward centres in the brain are affected by sleep loss. Those centres stimulate people to go for those higher fat foods,” she said by email.   Dr. Samuel Klein, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, noted that short experimental studies in research units show that short sleep increases hunger, increases appetite and increases food intake.    Klein, who wasn’t involved in the study, said people can get better sleep by focusing on a combination of two things: getting more sleep for the hours spent in bed and increasing the time they allocate for sleeping.   “Things like keeping the room where you sleep cool and dark, don’t have a lot of lights on before bedtime, keep it dark, don’t watch TV in bed,” he said by email.   “Go to bed earlier, wake up later. Those are things that can be done by really making sleep a priority,” Klein added.  "
2tXMK6Y,2017-08-01,Exercise linked to lower mortality with early prostate cancer," (Reuters Health) - Men with prostate cancer that hasn’t spread may have longer survival the more they exercise, a recent study suggests.   For these men, regular moderate or vigorous physical activity was associated with 31 percent to 37 percent lower likelihood of death during the study, compared to more modest amounts of exercise.    “This confirms and expands on previous work that shows an inverse association between recreational physical activity after diagnosis and risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality,” said lead study author Ying Wang of the American Cancer Society in Atlanta, Georgia, in email to Reuters Health.    Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death among U.S. men, according to the American Cancer Society. The country’s 3.3 million prostate cancer survivors account for 21 percent of all cancer survivors.    Wang and colleagues pulled data from a large, long-term study group established by the American Cancer Society in 1992, focusing on 7,000 men who were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1992 and 2011.    The average age at cancer diagnosis was 71, and there were 2,700 deaths through 2012, including 450 due to prostate cancer and 750 due to heart disease. The average time from diagnosis to death was about eight years for those who died from cancer and 10 years for those who died from other causes.    Men who were more active before diagnosis were more likely to have lower-risk cancer tumors and a history of prostate screenings. They were also leaner, more likely to be nonsmokers and vitamin users and they ate more fish.   Both before and after diagnosis, walking accounted for 73 percent of the physical activity that men did, followed by 10 percent for cycling and 5 percent for aerobic exercise, according to the report in European Urology.    After standardizing the men’s weekly exercise times and intensity levels, the researchers compared mortality rates among all the men to those who did some physical activity but not much. They wanted to avoid comparisons to the least active men, who were likely also the sickest overall, because their sedentary lifestyles were potentially due to other reasons.   Based on exercise levels before diagnosis, moderate to vigorous exercise, including walking, was linked to lower risk of death from prostate cancer, but only for men with lower-risk tumors.   But after the diagnosis, the same levels of exercise were linked to lower risk of death from prostate cancer for all men, although the apparent benefit of walking was no longer statistically meaningful.   The rising rage of prostate cancer “keeps the conversation going” regarding efforts to prevent and treat it, said Dr. Antony Wekesa of Eurofins Lancaster Laboratories in Cork, Ireland, who wasn’t involved in the study.    A limitation of the study is that it used self-reported data about the men’s exercise and other lifestyle details, Wekesa told Reuters Health by email. The low number of minority participants also obscures possible differences among groups that often have higher prostate cancer rates.   Three clinical trials at the University of California, San Francisco are focused on the effects of physical activity in men with prostate cancer, noted Erin Van Blarigan of UCSF, who wasn’t involved in the current study.    The American Cancer Society and American College of Sports Medicine recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise each week.    That guideline “is a good starting goal for men who have been diagnosed,” Van Blarigan told Reuters Health by email. “However, men with prostate cancer should work toward continuing to increase their physical activity . . . likely twice that amount.”  "
2vllnDk,2017-08-01,Weight gain between pregnancies tied to gestational diabetes," (Reuters Health) - Women who gain substantial amounts of weight after their first pregnancy may be more likely to develop gestational diabetes during their next pregnancy, a Norwegian study suggests.    Gestational diabetes is a form of glucose intolerance that develops for the first time during pregnancy. The condition is more common among women who are overweight or obese when they become pregnant or who gain a lot of weight during pregnancy.    “It is important to prevent gestational diabetes as it is associated with complications in mothers and babies during birth, and health care costs in mothers with gestational diabetes are 25 percent higher compared to non-diabetic mothers,” said lead study author Linn Marie Sorbye, a midwife and public health researcher at the University of Bergen in Norway.    For the current study, researchers examined data on 24,198 mothers in Norway with a first and second pregnancy between 2006 and 2014.    Compared to women whose weight didn’t fluctuate much after the first pregnancy, women whose body mass index (BMI) - a ratio of weight to height – rose significantly were between twice and more than five times as likely to develop gestational diabetes during their second pregnancy, the study found.    Overall, there were 18 cases of gestational diabetes for every 1,000 second pregnancies, researchers report in PLOS Medicine.    The focus on promoting healthy weight in the reproductive population needs to be expanded to include preconception throughout reproduction, Sorbye said by email.    Women who are underweight at the start of pregnancy should gain 28 to 40 pounds, while women who are normal weight are advised to gain 25 to 35 pounds, according to the U.S. Institute of Medicine. For overweight women, a 15- to 25-pound gain is recommended and obese women should gain just 11 to 20 pounds.   For a nonpregnant adult who is 5 feet 9 inches tall, gaining just ten pounds is more than enough to go up more than one BMI unit, the threshold in the study for an increased risk of gestational diabetes.    Slightly more than one third of the women in the study gained more than one BMI unit of weight between the start of their first pregnancy and the start of their second pregnancy. This included women who didn’t lose all of the weight after the first baby arrived as well as women who gained extra pounds between pregnancies.    Women who gained up to two BMI units of weight between pregnancies had a doubled risk of gestational diabetes compared to women who gained no more than one BMI unit, the study found. Women who gained four BMI units, meanwhile, had a five-fold increased risk of gestational diabetes.    A BMI calculator is available for free online from the National Institutes of Health, at  bit.ly/2tXeEf4.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how or if a failure to lose baby weight or a gain of extra pounds between pregnancies causes gestational diabetes.    “Further research is needed to tease out exactly how changes in weight, particularly over short time interpregnancy intervals, have adverse metabolic effects in future pregnancies,” Dr. Jacinda Nicklas, a researcher at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study said by email.    Shorter periods between pregnancies may not give women enough time to lose weight and increase their risk of gestational diabetes the second time around, said Dr. Sharleen O’Reilly a researcher at University College Dublin in Ireland.    “Weight loss should be a mix of healthy eating and more physical activity, and we know that both together are more effective in helping women lose weight after pregnancy,” O’Reilly said by email.

2wlZgK5,2017-08-02,Typical adults eat enough salt to damage heart," Reuters Health - The amount of salt a typical American adult consumes each day may be enough to damage the heart muscle and make it harder to pump blood, a U.S. study suggests.    A high-salt diet has long been linked to higher odds of developing high blood pressure and heart disease as well as an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and heart failure. But determining the ideal amount of dietary salt is controversial because some research has also found an elevated risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and heart attacks in otherwise healthy people who consume too little salt.    In the current study, half of the people consumed at least 3.73 grams a day of sodium, the equivalent of about two teaspoons of table salt.    Compared with adults who ate less sodium, people who consumed more than 3.7 grams of sodium a day were more likely to have enlargement in the left chambers of the heart that are responsible for pumping oxygen-rich blood into the body. They were also more likely to have signs of muscle strain in the heart that can precede structural damage.   “This study enhances our understanding of the adverse effects of salt intake on heart function,” said lead study author Dr. Senthil Selvaraj, a researcher at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.    While the results don’t settle the debate over the optimal amount of salt, the findings should still encourage people who eat a lot of salt to cut back, Selvaraj said by email. That’s because reducing sodium intake can help reverse high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart failure, stroke and heart attacks.    “There is still a healthy debate ongoing,” Selvaraj added. “It is still worth the effort to reduce your sodium intake.”   Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, killing almost one in every three people.    Sodium is found not only in table salt, but also in a variety of foods such as bread, milk, eggs, meat, and shellfish as well as processed items like soup, pretzels, popcorn, soy sauce and bouillon or stock cubes.   To lower the risk of heart disease, adults should reduce sodium intake to less than 2 grams a day, or the equivalent of about one teaspoon of salt, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).   For the current study, researchers examined data from lab tests of sodium intake, heart structure and heart function for almost 3,000 adults.    Participants were 49 years old on average, 54 percent had high blood pressure and half were African-American. They were typically overweight or obese.    To assess how sodium intake influenced the heart, researchers accounted for age, sex, smoking status, alcohol use, activity levels, and certain medications.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how or if salt damages the heart or impairs heart function.    One limitation of the study is that researchers tested sodium intake using overnight urine samples, which may not be as accurate as the gold standard, 24-hour urine collection, the authors note in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.    Researchers also didn’t have enough data on people who consumed very little sodium to assess how low salt intake influences the heart.    “We know less than we should about salt,” said Thomas Marwick, author of an accompanying editorial and director of the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia.    “In general, most of the population take far more salt than is good for them and this is a reminder to reduce intake,” Marwick said by email.    “It’s ubiquitous and hard to reduce to very low levels,” Marwick added. “While some zealots want to reduce intake to zero, I’m not sure that drastic reduction is necessarily beneficial.”  "
2hkvFxX,2017-08-01,Dog owners more likely to exercise regularly," (Reuters Health) - Dog owners who walk their pets outside are more likely to have regular exercise habits, regardless of weather, according to a new study.   Regular dog walkers were more active on days with cold, rainy weather - and on days with the worst weather conditions, they had 20 percent higher activity levels and were more active for 30 minutes per day, compared to people who didn’t have dogs.   “As we get older, we decline in the amount of physical activity we get, and we tend to be less active at the time in our lives when it’s best to be active,” said study author Andy Jones of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK.   Jones and colleagues analyzed data collected as part of a large study of community-dwelling adults ages 40 to 79 in Norfolk, UK. Overall, the average age was around 70, and 57 percent were female.   Participants wore accelerometers to record their daily physical activity and sedentary behavior. They also answered questions about environmental conditions, age, education, gender, health status and pet ownership.   Among the more than 3,100 study subjects, 18 percent owned dogs, and two-thirds of those walked their dogs at least once a day. Regular dog walkers were consistently more active, regardless of weather and environmental conditions, and those who reported good health were more likely to be dog owners who walked their dogs regularly.   Overall, daily activity was lower on days with rain, colder temperatures and shorter daylight hours. On dry days, however, regular dog walkers still got outside, even if it was cold. In fact, on average, regular dog walkers were more active on the coldest days than non-regular dog walkers or non-dog-owners were on the warmest days. Regular dog-walkers were also more active on the shortest days than non-walkers and non-owners were on the longest days.   “It’s no surprise that dog walkers are more active, but we were surprised by how big the difference is,” Jones said. “If we could achieve that level of activity with everybody, it would go a long way in dealing with problems of obesity and aging.”    Importantly, even dog-owners who don’t walk their dogs regularly are less sedentary than people without dogs, pointed out Ann Toohey of the University of Calgary in Canada. Toohey, who wasn’t involved with this study, studies aging, dog-walking and neighborhood communities.   “Various aspects of taking care of a dog, such as letting them in and outside, feeding them, playing with them, grooming them and cleaning up after them, may help to explain this,” she told Reuters Health by email. “I think we need to take note and explore further the benefits of pets in daily living.”   “Taking the time to engage in physical activity has important health benefits, and walking is recommended because it is low-cost and can be done alone or with others,” said Angela Curl, who researches environment, the human-animal bond, and older adults’ physical health at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.    Curl, who wasn’t involved with this study, told Reuters Health by email, “Dog owners have a visual reminder to get up and exercise that can provide the motivation to walk. Non-dog owners can find alternative ways to engage in physical activity during inclement weather, such as walking indoors.”  "
2w2vmvi,2017-08-01,Gum infections linked to several cancers in women," Reuters Health - Older women with gum infections are more likely to get many common cancers than their peers who have perfect oral health, a recent study suggests.    Researchers focused on what’s known as periodontal disease, serious infections in the mouth that are caused by bacteria in dental plaque. Daily brushing and flossing can prevent gingivitis, the milder form of periodontal disease, but untreated cases can lead to permanent damage to the gums and bone.    Compared to women without oral health problems, women with periodontal disease were 14 percent more likely to develop cancer, the study found.    The biggest risk was for cancer of the esophagus, which was three times more likely in women with periodontal disease. Women with periodontal disease were also 31 percent more likely to be diagnosed with lung tumors, 73 percent more likely to get gallbladder cancers, 13 percent more likely to have breast tumors and 23 percent more likely to have melanoma.    “We know that periodontal disease can lead to tooth loss if not treated, and it is also associated with diabetes and other chronic diseases,” said senior study author Jean Wactawski-Wende, dean of the School of Public Health and Health Professions at the University at Buffalo in New York.    “Here we found an association with cancer,” Wactawski-Wende said by email. “Although not certain, maintaining optimal oral hygiene may help to reduce the risk of developing cancer.”   Periodontal disease was associated with increased risks of several types of cancer in postmenopausal women, even in women who had never smoked, researchers note in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.    Compared to women without periodontal disease, current and former smokers with these oral infections were roughly 20 percent more likely to develop cancer.    Certain cancers, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and gallbladder cancer, were associated with higher risk in smokers with periodontal disease. Others, such as melanoma, were associated with higher risk in women who had never smoked but did have periodontal disease.   The data are from 65,869 women aged 54 to 86 who answered surveys between 1999 and 2003. By 2013 - after an average follow-up of more than eight years - researchers had identified 7,149 cases of cancer.   While the exact causes for the connection between periodontal disease and cancer aren’t clear, it’s possible that bacteria travels from the mouth to other parts of the body, Wactawski-Wende said.    Bacteria destroy connective tissue between the teeth and gums, forming pockets where the infection can persist and eventually be ingested or inhaled from saliva or enter the bloodstream through inflamed gums, Wactawski-Wende said. Then, bacteria may lodge in other body sites causing inflammation that may increase the risk of cancer.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how or if poor oral health causes cancer.    Another limitation is that the study relied on women to accurately recall and report their periodontal disease, the authors note.    Even so, the findings build on earlier research linking periodontal disease to an increased risk of cancer, said Jiyoung Ahn, a population health and environmental medicine researcher at New York University Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It is clear that good oral hygiene and regular dental visits are basic components of maintaining good oral health,” Ahn said by email. “This study provides a rationale for having good oral health for cancer prevention.”  "
2tY29nF,2017-08-01,Molecular profile hints at inflammatory processes in chronic fatigue," (Reuters Health) - - People with severe symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome have a molecular signature in their blood made up of 17 immune system signaling molecules that are elevated, which may provide insight into how inflammation contributes to the mysterious condition.    Inflammation is the immune system’s response to injuries and illnesses. The study identified variations in molecules known as cytokines that are responsible for sending messages and sounding an alarm, including several that can trigger inflammation.    Chronic fatigue syndrome can involve years of crippling pain and exhaustion, but is a controversial diagnosis because patients can’t take a test to prove they have it. The current study results build on earlier experiments linking inflammation to the condition and might one day help create a blood test to diagnose it or lead to effective treatments, researchers say.    “What is at stake here is ‘proof of concept’ that this disease is real,” said lead study author Dr. Jose G. Montoya of Stanford University School of Medicine in California.    “Patients have been humiliated, ostracized, and ignored,” Montoya said by email.    Millions of people worldwide, including more than 1 million in the U.S. alone, suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome, the researchers note in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.    Doctors may diagnose the condition, also called myalgic encephalomyelitis, when people have at least six months of debilitating fatigue that can’t be explained by other causes and make it difficult for them to keep up with school, work or social activities. Symptoms can appear in different combinations and intensities and may include sleep problems, cognitive impairment, fever, sore throat, or sensitivity to noise, light or certain foods.    The National Academy of Medicine recently proposed a new name for the condition, systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), because of its hallmark symptom of crushing fatigue after any kind of exertion, the authors note.    Many, but not all, chronic fatigue syndrome patients experience flu-like symptoms common in diseases caused by inflammation, they add.    For the current study, researchers examined blood samples from 192 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and a control group of 392 healthy people.   The scientists found that some cytokine levels were lower in patients with mild forms of chronic fatigue syndrome than in the group of healthy individuals, but higher in people with severe symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome.    One protein in particular, tumor growth factor beta (TGF-beta), was higher in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome than in the healthy controls, while another protein, resistin was lower.   However, the study team also found that the concentrations of 17 of the 51 cytokines they examined were associated with disease severity. Thirteen of those 17 cytokines are pro-inflammatory, the authors note.    Taken together, the findings build on previous research demonstrating that chronic fatigue syndrome is a real illness, and not something patients make up or experience only for psychological reasons, experts say.    “Many people with (chronic fatigue syndrome) report that their illness began with symptoms associated with a typical respiratory infection including fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, muscle weakness and fatigue, but the clinical course was atypical and they never fully recovered,” said Dr. Ian Lipkin, a researcher at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University in New York.    “Many of these symptoms can be explained by circulating immune system molecules described by Montoya and colleagues in this paper, as well as by others who have reported similar findings,” Lipkin, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    The development of a biomarker such as a diagnostic blood test for chronic fatigue syndrome would be a major advance in understanding the condition and treating it, said Dr. Shaheen Lakhan, a neurology researcher at California University of Science and Medicine in San Bernardino who wasn’t involved in the study.    “We currently do not have such a test,” Lakhan said by email. “Not only will it permit objective diagnosis, it may guide new drug development and be used to monitor disease activity and responsiveness to treatments.”   "
2eUSS9j,2017-07-28,Occupational pesticide and herbicide exposure tied to lung disease," (Reuters Health) - Workers exposed to pesticides and herbicides on the job may be more likely than other people to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis and other breathing problems, an Australian study suggests.    With any herbicide exposure at work, people were more than twice as likely to develop COPD by middle age, and workplace pesticide exposure was associated with 74 percent higher odds of the common lung disease, researchers report in Thorax.   Over a lifetime, pesticides and herbicides may pose an even bigger added risk for breathing disorders, the study also found.    Each ten-year increase in occupational exposure to pesticides carried a 12 percent increased risk of COPD and a 16 percent higher risk of developing chronic bronchitis. Every extra decade of herbicide exposure, meanwhile, carried a 22 percent increased risk of bronchitis, while each ten years of insecticide exposure was associated with 15 percent higher odds of bronchitis.    “Our study looked at long-term exposure to pesticides, and it is thought that long-term exposure to pesticides increases mucus secretion and muscle contraction in the lungs, causing breathlessness, cough and wheeze,” lead study author Dr. Sheikh Alif of the University of Melbourne in Australia said by email.    Globally, more than 65 million people have moderate to severe COPD, and the condition causes about 5 percent of all deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).    Most cases are caused by smoking or exposure to second-hand smoke, but working or cooking around certain toxic dusts, chemicals and fuels can also contribute, as can frequent respiratory infections during childhood.   For the current study, researchers examined data collected on 1,335 workers from 2002 to 2008, including information on workplace exposure to pollutants as well as results from breathing tests to detect COPD and other respiratory issues.    Study participants were 45 year old on average, 87 percent were currently employed and 25 percent were current smokers.    Overall, 6 percent of them had COPD, 8.6 percent had chronic bronchitis, and more than 28 percent reported having asthma currently or previously.    In addition to risks associated with pesticides and herbicides, the study also found workers who didn’t have asthma had an increased risk of COPD when they had any exposure to toxic mineral dust, gases, fumes and vapors. There didn’t appear to be an association between exposure to these pollutants and COPD in people with asthma, however.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how exposure to pollutants at work might contribute to COPD, bronchitis or other breathing problems.    “We can not make firm conclusions about the extent of exposure needed to cause changes in lung function,” said Dr. Steve Georas, an environmental health researcher at the University of Rochester in New York who wasn’t involved in the study.    “We know that single exposures to high levels of some toxicants can cause long lasting changes in airway function (i.e. chlorine gas),” Georas said by email. “I suspect that for pesticides and herbicides, long-term low level exposure may be more important, but this is speculation.”  "
2h8Vj92,2017-07-28,Sport federations could do more to promote public health," (Reuters Health) - - Just two out of 28 international sports federations focus on promoting physical activity as a way to reduce disease, according to a new study that surveyed the international organizations represented at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games.   Only FIFA and FINA, the international soccer and aquatics governing bodies, make universal exercise messages a priority, researchers found.   “The global epidemic of non-communicable diseases is an important public health issue,” said lead author Dr. Margo Mountjoy of the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine of McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada, in an email.   “Sport, as the gate-keepers to physical activity, has a moral and ethical role in promoting physical activity,” said Mountjoy, who also chairs the sports medicine committee of the Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA) in Lausanne, Switzerland.   Insufficient physical activity is one of four lifestyle risk factors – along with poor diet, tobacco use and alcohol abuse - strongly associated with serious chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes and metabolic syndrome, according to the World Health Organization.    In 2016, Mountjoy and colleagues asked 28 international sports governing bodies to rank the importance of 11 health-related topics. They also asked for updates since a 2012 survey about priorities and research activity around 27 other health-related areas. The 28 groups represent nearly 5,000 national sport federations that had more than 11,000 athletes at the 2016 summer Olympics.   “Fight against doping” was the highest priority for 96 percent of the groups, followed by “image as a safe sport.” Topics with the lowest rankings were “increasing the number of elite athletes,” “health of recreational athletes” and “health of the general population.”    With health-related programs and research, the most common activities were “injury prevention by regulation of equipment and venues” and “first aid or minimum safety standards at events.” The least common research priorities were “technology-based health risks,” “prevention of chronic disease in the general population” and “relative energy deficiency in sport.”    Only FINA and soccer’s Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) had prevention of chronic disease on their list of priorities.   Compared to 2012, the priority ranking of focusing on the health of the general population had dropped significantly, the new survey showed.    After the 2012 survey, researchers had recommended that international sports groups give health promotion more attention, Mountjoy said.   “Despite this recommendation, it was disappointing to learn that the most statistically significant finding was the decreasing priority of physical activity promotion.”   The Medical and Scientific Consultative Group of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations has a follow-up plan, Mountjoy added. In November, the group will host a workshop for medical directors of the international sports federations to learn ways to develop athlete safety and promote general global health.   FINA has a “Swimming for All-Swimming for Life” campaign to promote swimming and prevent drowning internationally, she noted. The FIFA Medical Assessment and Research Center has an “11 for Health” program that pairs soccer-based activities with health initiatives for schoolchildren.   “Health promotion through sports and physical activity should be a joint effort of all stakeholders,” Astrid Junge of the Medical School of Hamburg in Germany said by email. “For example, health insurance companies should play a major role,” said Junge, who wasn’t involved in the current study but worked with Mountjoy on the 2012 survey.

2vPYsxP,2017-07-28,Higher risk for celiac disease in diabetic children," (Reuters Health) - - Celiac disease (CD) is more common in young people with type 1 diabetes than in diabetes-free kids, although how often the two conditions occur together varies in different countries, a new study finds.   “Celiac disease is not uncommon in type 1 diabetes, and regular screening is important,” the study’s lead author Dr. Maria Craig, from UNSW Medicine in Kensington, New South Wales, Australia, told Reuters Health by email.    Shared genetic risk is the major reason why CD is more common in type 1 diabetes patients, she added.   In type 1 diabetes, a chronic autoimmune condition typically diagnosed in children and young adults, the pancreas produces little or no insulin, a hormone the body needs to help convert blood sugar into energy for cells.    In CD, which is also an autoimmune disorder, consuming the protein gluten in wheat, barley or rye leads to damage of the small intestine that interferes with absorption of nutrients from food.    About 5 percent of people with type 1 diabetes have CD, compared to about 1 percent of the overall population, Craig and her colleagues write in Diabetes Care.   To see if this is true uniformly around the world, they looked at the prevalence of CD in four different registries of type 1 diabetes patients in Germany/Austria, the U.S., the UK and Australasia. The analysis included data from 2013 and 2014 on 52,721 children and teens under age 18.   Overall, 3.5 percent of the young people with diabetes in the study had CD, and the prevalence ranged from 1.9 percent in the U.S. to 7.7 percent in Australia. Girls were more likely to have CD than boys, at 4.3 percent versus 2.7 percent, respectively. On average, the children who had CD had been diagnosed with diabetes when they were 5.4 years old, compared to diagnosis at age 7 for children without CD.   While blood sugar control was just as good for the children with CD as for those without CD, the study found that children with CD were likely to be shorter.    “While the overall difference was modest, some children demonstrated important differences in height, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment,” Craig said.  "
2h6uZfu,2017-07-27,More than half of men with diabetes have erectile dysfunction," (Reuters Health) - Diabetes has long been considered the number one risk factor for erectile dysfunction, and a new analysis of past research finds the sexual disorder is extremely common among men with diabetes, afflicting some 53 percent.   The study of data on nearly 90,000 men found those with diabetes are three and a half times more likely than men without the disease to have difficulty maintaining an erection, according to the report in Diabetic Medicine.   Because erectile dysfunction can be a sign of the often silent cardiovascular issues that go along with diabetes, doctors should take the sexual complaint as a cue to screen for both diabetes and heart disease, the study team writes.    “Erectile dysfunction, due to its evident presentation, can play a crucial role in early diabetes mellitus diagnosis and acts as an alarm bell for other silent complications,” said study coauthor Dr. Damiano Pizzol, coordinator of the Operational Research Unit of Doctors with Africa Cuamm in Beira, Mozambique.    Since 1980, the number of people with diabetes worldwide has soared from 108 million to 422 million, the study team writes, and the prevalence among adults has increased from 4.7 percent to 8.5 percent.    Although erectile dysfunction is most common in men over age 40, it can occur at any age alongside diabetes and heart disease, they note.   “Too often, the lack of prevention, an unhealthy diet and lack of physical exercise leads to a late diagnosis of diabetes,” Pizzol told Reuters Health by email. Many times, he added, complications like erectile dysfunction lead to the initial diabetes diagnosis.    The researchers analyzed 145 studies that included 88,577 men to understand how common erectile dysfunction is with diabetes. Most of the studies were conducted in Asia and Europe, and half focused only on men with type 2 diabetes, the more common form of the disease that’s associated with age and obesity.    The research team found that overall, 37.5 percent of men with type 1 diabetes and 66.3 percent of those with type 2 diabetes had erectile dysfunction. Rates varied significantly across countries and were highest in South America and lowest in North America.    Erectile dysfunction also developed about 10 to 15 years earlier in men with diabetes compared to men without the disease.   “Raising awareness of erectile dysfunction and other related men’s health issues would encourage a much-needed discussion, which is often overlooked or even avoided by patients and health care professionals,” said Dr. Laith Alzweri, a urology fellow at Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Erectile function could be viewed as an indirect parameter of a man’s general well-being, both mental and physical,” Alzweri told Reuters Health by email.    In addition to screening for diabetes when men complain of erectile dysfunction as the study authors recommend, screening for erectile dysfunction by health care professionals should be part of the routine assessment of diabetic men, he said.   A major limitation of the analysis is that only a quarter of the studies included information about complications associated with diabetes. Also, studies included in the analysis could vary in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, the type of diabetes, diagnosis of complications, diabetes health care offerings and insurance coverage, especially across countries, said Dr. Zdravko Kamenov of Alexandrovska University Hospital in Sofia, Bulgaria, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “The large regional variations are intriguing,” he told Reuters Health by email. “Cultural, psychological and other factors could affect the reported rates of erectile dysfunction.”   Diabetes is estimated to reach 322 million cases worldwide by 2025, and erectile dysfunction is cited as the third most frequent complication of diabetes, he noted.   Future studies should focus on other long-term diabetes risk factors associated with erectile dysfunction, such as smoking and length of diagnosis. The exact hormonal, physical and psychological connections between diabetes and erectile dysfunction could also point researchers toward new treatment options, Kamenov said.   “Erectile function is a window to men’s health,” he added. “In most cases, one question is enough to open the window.”  "
2eRfhnV,2017-07-27,Sleep may even help memory in very young babies," (Reuters Health) - Three-month-old infants have better recall when they get a brief nap after learning something new, according to small experiment that suggests sleep may play a role in solidifying memories very early in life.    While previous research has linked frequent naps to better memory in babies as young as 6 months, the current study examined the impact of a single 1.5- to 2-hour nap for infants half that age.    The experiment tested memory by counting on babies to quickly tire of looking at faces they remember. Researchers showed infants one of two cartoon characters with distinctive facial features, let some of the babies nap, then showed all of the babies both characters to see which one captured their attention longer.    More than half of the babies who napped turned their gaze to the unfamiliar cartoon face, indicating they remembered what they saw before they slept, the study found. But without a nap, babies appeared to randomly choose which face they looked at, suggesting they forgot what they had seen before and found both cartoons new and interesting.    “Three month-old babies could only remember the newly shown face if they had a nap right after seeing the new cartoon face,” said lead study author Dr. Klara Horvath, who conducted the study at the University of Oxford in the UK.   “It seems for them having a short period of sleep is necessary to be able to consolidate memories, otherwise they just forget the newly learned information,” Horvath, now a pediatrics researcher at Semmelweis University in Budapest, said by email.    For the study, researchers also looked at something known as sleep spindles, or spikes of brain activity thought to be involved in consolidation of memories. Sleep spindles show up on electroencephalogram (EEG) tests that examine brain wave patterns.    Among babies who napped, infants who also had more sleep spindles appeared to become familiar with the faces more quickly, suggesting that the brief periods of rest might influence how fast the brain processes information, researchers report in Developmental Science.   One limitation of the study is its small size - only 45 infants altogether. There were just 28 babies in the nap group, and only 15 had EEG data.   Another drawback is that all the babies in the nap group saw the cartoon faces right before they went to sleep, making it impossible to rule out the potential for that learning experience to influence the number of sleep spindles, the researchers note.    The study also didn’t find a difference in memory based on the duration of babies’ naps, which suggests that more sleep may not always be best when it comes to learning, said Sabine Seehagen, a psychology researcher at the University of Waikato in New Zealand who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It is possible that some undetermined minimum duration of sleep was all that was needed for infants to ‘succeed’ in the task,” Seehagen said by email. “We also don’t know how effective the nap was compared to, say, a full night’s sleep and we don’t know if several naps might have added benefits.”   Still, the findings offer fresh evidence that sleep is critical to normal development even at a very young age, said Gina Poe, a researcher in physiology and psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “We neuroscientists and biopsychologists have a long way to go before we understand how long different types of memory consolidation tasks take and why,” Poe said. “But once the job is done, more sleep may be akin to the builders hammering more nails into a structure that is already securely connected.”   That doesn’t mean that parents should cut short naps to help babies’ development, however.    “Even if the job that you are tracking is done with a short nap, there may be other brain tasks that the brain is attending to during a longer nap that we don’t know about,” Poe added. “So never wake a sleeping baby.”  "
2u34xVf,2017-07-27,Trans teens worse off on health measures than peers," (Reuters Health) - Teenagers who identify as transgender or gender nonconforming may be worse off on several health measures than their non-transgender classmates, suggests a new study from Minnesota.   Compared to their classmates, transgender and gender nonconforming teens were more likely to engage in risky behavior and less likely to have traits that would protect them from poor health outcomes, researchers found.   “One of our most surprising findings was that the prevalence of a trans identity was almost identical in the metropolitan area and the non-metro parts of the state, showing that support for these teens is needed in all areas,” said lead author Marla Eisenberg, of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.   People who are transgender or gender nonconforming have a gender and sex that do not align at birth. People are called cisgender if their sex and gender do align at birth.   As reported in the Journal of Adolescent Health, Eisenberg and colleagues analyzed data that had been collected regularly through a survey of high school students in Minnesota. In 2016, the survey started asking about gender identities.   Overall, of the 81,885 students in grades 9 and 11 who responded to the survey in 2016, 2.7 percent identified as transgender or gender nonconforming.    Students were more likely to identify with that group if they were assigned female at birth, faced severe economic hardship or were American Indian, Pacific Islander or multiracial.   About 61 percent of transgender and gender nonconforming students reported suicidal thoughts, compared to 20 percent their cisgender peers, researchers found.   Similarly, 31 percent of transgender and gender nonconforming students reported attempting suicide, compared to about 7 percent of their classmates.   Transgender and gender nonconforming students were also less likely to report traits that may protect against poor outcomes.   Cisgender students reported higher levels of family connectedness than transgender and gender non-conforming students, for example.   The study’s findings regarding suicidal thoughts and attempts are similar to what’s been found in other research, Eisenberg told Reuters Health by email.   “Other findings, however, did not show the substantial differences we have seen elsewhere,” she added. “For example, we did find significant disparities in substance use, but not as great as in prior studies with adults.”   The researchers conclude that people who work with and on behalf of youth should recognize the special needs of this population and work as their allies.   “They need and deserve support, respect, safety and love just like all other young people,” said Eisenberg.  "
2v3nHyO,2017-07-27,Vaccine lessens severity of whooping cough infections," (Reuters Health) - Even though vaccinations don’t always prevent whooping cough, people have milder symptoms of the respiratory illness and lower odds of serious complications with the vaccine than without it, a U.S. study suggests.                     FILE PHOTO: A nurse displays a tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis whooping cough vaccine at a free medical and dental health clinic in Los Angeles, California, U.S., April 27, 2016. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson      More than three in four cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, occurred in people who were up to date on their vaccinations, the analysis of multistate disease surveillance data found.    Babies and young children had 60 percent lower odds of severe infections, however, when they had received all recommended childhood pertussis vaccinations. And, with up-to-date vaccinations, most infected children and adults had 30 percent lower odds of severe vomiting, a hallmark of more serious infections.    “These findings are very important because they show that even though pertussis vaccines do not prevent all cases of pertussis, breakthrough cases that occur in vaccinated people are less likely to be severe,” said lead study author Lucy McNamara, of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.    “That means fewer hospitalizations and serious complications for patients,” McNamara said by email.    The bacterium Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough, which gets its nickname from the sounds patients make as they gasp for air during intense coughing fits. Pertussis is highly contagious and easily spread when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. Many babies less than 1 year old who catch pertussis require hospitalization for serious complications like pneumonia or brain disorders.   The CDC recommends that children get five doses of the DTaP vaccine for tetnanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis at ages 2, 4 and 6 months, between ages 15 and 18 months, and between ages 4 and 6 years.    A single dose of a different version of the vaccine, called Tdap, is recommended for people 11 through 64 years old.    For the current study, researchers examined data on 9,801 pertussis cases from 2010 to 2012 in U.S. patients at least 3 months old. Cases came from statewide infection registries in Connecticut, Minnesota and New Mexico as well as from select counties in Colorado, New York and Oregon.    Almost four in five cases occurred in patients under 20 years old, and more than half of infections happened in children 12 or younger.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that vaccination reduces the severity of the infections that shots don’t prevent.    One limitation of the study is that it’s possible people who get all recommended vaccinations on time also have other healthy behaviors that make them less likely to catch pertussis or to suffer from severe symptoms, the authors note.    Even so, the findings offer fresh evidence that the current version of the vaccine is working, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.    The CDC changed the vaccine in the 1990s from a version using whole cells known as DTP to the current version, known as DTap, which has fewer side effects such as fevers, Hotez, said by email.    Even though the total number of pertussis cases has crept up a little bit with DTaP, the findings suggest it’s doing a good job at protecting infants against severe cases, added Hotez, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “This is good news since it provides further evidence that the U.S. pertussis vaccine program can continue to work with DTaP,” Hotez said.    While much of the previous research has focused on childhood vaccination, the current study shows that adults, too, can benefit from the pertussis vaccine even if they still get whooping cough, said Dr. Kevin Schwartz, a public health researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the study   “The biggest danger of adults getting pertussis is they can spread the infection to those who are at the highest risk of pertussis-related complications and death, including young children who haven’t received any or all of their vaccinations yet,” Schwartz said by email.    “Even though vaccine protection decreases over time, the best way to protect babies from severe pertussis is to make sure everyone is up-to-date with their recommended pertussis vaccines,” Schwartz added.

2tDgJgk,2017-07-27,Adult colorectal cancer risk tied to weight as a teen," (Reuters Health) - Being overweight or obese as a teenager may increase a person’s risk of developing colorectal cancer as an adult, suggests a large Israeli study.   Long-term follow-up of 1.79 million Israeli men and women examined for military service as teenagers showed that overweight and obese teens were over 50 percent more likely to develop colon or rectal cancer by middle age, compared to normal-weight peers.   “The findings from the study show evidence that being overweight and obese in adolescence are associated with an increased risk of subsequent colon cancer in both men and woman,” said Dr. Avni Desai, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study   “Obesity was also noted to have an association with an increased risk of rectal cancer in men,” she told Reuters Health by email.    “Other smaller studies have shown a possible association with obesity and adolescence and future risk of colorectal cancer, but this is the largest study to show the association,” Desai said, adding that in past research the association has been stronger for men.    For the study, published in the journal Cancer, Dr. Zohar Levi, a researcher at Rabin Medical Center and Tel Aviv University and his team analyzed data from millions of Israeli adolescents who underwent compulsory examinations to determine their fitness for military service from 1967 to 2010.    The young men and women were between the ages of 16 and 19 at the time of the examinations, and Levi’s team used a national cancer registry to track who was diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer through December 2012.    The average follow-up was 23 years and the researchers identified almost 2,967 new cases of colorectal cancer in the study group. Among men, there were 1,403 cases of colon cancer and 574 cases of rectal cancer, and among women, 764 colon cancers and 226 rectal cancers.   Being overweight or obese at the initial military examination was associated with 53 percent and 54 percent higher risks of colon cancer for men and women, respectively, compared to normal-weight peers.   In men, obesity was associated with a 71 percent increased risk of rectal cancer, and in women, being obese more than doubled that risk.    Levi did not respond to a request for comments.   This study does have some limitations, said Desai.   “It is looking at a specific group, Israeli Jewish men and women, the studied group included predominantly men.  As such it is unclear if the results would be similar in the general U.S. population,” she said.   Additionally, the researchers didn’t have information about adult body weights, so it is unclear whether obese or overweight teens stayed heavy or slim teens gained weight in adulthood.   “The study could not assess whether risk of colorectal cancer was related to adult obesity independent of adolescent obesity,” Desai said. “Also, other risk factors that may affect risk of colorectal cancer such as family history, level of physical activity, diet, and smoking were not reported in the study. Family history is a risk factor for diagnosis of colorectal cancer, especially at a young age.”    Desai noted that although the participants were followed for at least 10 years, they were still fairly young at the end of the study.   “The median age of colorectal cancer diagnosis in the study was 49.4 years, which is younger than the average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer,” she said, adding that 90 percent of colorectal cancers are diagnosed after the age of 50.     The average age of diagnosis of colorectal cancer in the United States is age 72, she added.   “Again, it is hard to pinpoint the exact causes of colorectal cancer in young patients, what we do know is a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of developing cancer.  This includes regular exercise, and a healthy diet, low in fat, high in fiber, with less red meats and processed meats,” she said.  "
2uIBV8r,2017-07-26,Study questions newer treatments to help premature babies breathe," (Reuters Health) - An analysis of extremely premature Australian babies who were tracked until their eighth birthday has concluded that the newer strategies to help preemies breathe easier while in a neonatal intensive care unit may have done more harm than good.   Survivors treated in 1997 were found to have better lung function at age 8 than those treated in 2005, the most recent year analyzed.   “It’s an incredibly thought-provoking study,” said Dr. Leif Nelin, chief of neonatology at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, who was not involved in the research. “It’s going to cause all of us to take a step back and think about what’ we’re doing.”   At issue is the best way to use oxygen therapy, steroids, extra air pressure in a technique known as CPAP, and other treatments to help children with dangerously-underdeveloped lungs breathe better.   The findings “suggest that we should not rush to embrace newer, noninvasive approaches to respiratory support in the belief that less is always more,” Drs. Michael Schreiber and Jeremy Marks of the University of Chicago write in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the study appears.   The assessment looked at 546 infants born prior to 28 weeks gestation in Victoria, Australia, at three points in time.    A team led by Dr. Lex Doyle of the Royal Women’s Hospital and the University of Melbourne found the rate of lung damage known as bronchopulmonary dysplasia was higher among the 8-year-olds treated in 2005 than those treated in the early 1990s and in 1997. Since 1991, steroid use to help the lungs mature has waxed and waned, and doctors have used a detergent-like drug called a surfactant to help keep immature lungs open and working properly.   “We would like to think everything gets better all the time, but that doesn’t always translate,” Doyle told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “We find we’re working harder and babies aren’t any better when we test their lungs at age 8.”   By age 8, the amount of air the children could exhale averaged 85.4 percent of its predicted value in the group born in 2005. It was 87.9 percent in the group born in 1991 and 1992 and 92.0 percent in the preemies born in 1997.   Lower lung capacity is a harbinger of problems later in life, said Doyle, because lung performance peaks when a person is in their 20s. “Then it’s all downhill from there. Because these children are not getting to the peak, they may end up getting lung problems earlier than others when they get old.”    “This will prompt neonatologists to wonder if they are over-treating their patients,” Nelin said.   But how doctors may be overtreating remains a mystery.   One possibility is that, unlike past eras, the oxygen content of a baby’s blood is continually monitored and “you wonder if that’s causing us to perhaps use oxygen more,” Nelin said. “In the past, you might have a baby who looked pink and good and didn’t have a monitor on, so you would say the baby’s fine. Now you have the same baby with a monitor that says its oxygen saturation is borderline so you might be quicker to put on oxygen or go to respiratory support (when it might not be necessary),” he explained.   “It’s not clear what needs to change, but some things need to be examined,” he said.   Doyle said his study “is not going to change practice and shouldn’t change practice. It should lead to people say, ‘Can we observe something similar in our part of the world.’ We may prove not to be correct. The study needs to be duplicated. It shouldn’t change practice because we don’t know which bit of practice might be better and what might be worse.”   The study also shows the importance of investing in testing new treatments to make sure they are really as beneficial as doctors believe.   “It’s really the whole basis for quality control,” Doyle said. “You can’t assume that they’re better. You have to check. The consequences can be lifelong so you really have to make sure what you’re doing is correct.”  "
2tX3yry,2017-07-26,Better at-home drug management needed to counter rising errors," (Reuters Health) - The percentage of Americans sickened as a result of medication errors outside of healthcare facilities doubled between 2000 and 2012, according to research highlighting the need for better labeling and dose management.   Medication mistakes outside of hospitals and other healthcare facilities - mostly at home - led to the deaths of 414 people during the 13 years studied, the study found.    More than one-third of the fatal mistakes were related to prescription and over-the-counter painkillers, according to the report in the Journal of Clinical Toxicology. Another 30 percent resulted from cardiovascular drugs, primarily beta-blockers such as metoprolol and atenolol, for example.   The errors involved a wide variety of drugs and people of all ages. Most could have been prevented, said lead author Nichole Hodges, a research scientist at the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.   “These errors are a significant public health burden with one-third of the cases resulting in hospital admission,” she said in a phone interview.    Most of the errors resulted from patients taking - or caregivers giving - a double dose, patients forgetting that they took the first pill and taking a second, or taking a pill from the wrong bottle, Hodges said.   “Drug manufacturers and pharmacists have a role to play when it comes to reducing medication errors,” said co-author Henry Spiller, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children’s.    “There is room for improvement in product packaging and labeling. Dosing instructions could be made clearer, especially for patients and caregivers with limited literacy or numeracy,” he said in a statement.   Researchers analyzed calls to poison control centers across the nation that resulted in the need for medical treatment. On average, poison control centers get calls about more than 5,200 medication errors a year resulting in serious medical outcomes outside of healthcare facilities.   The number of calls about drug mistakes rose 100 percent, from 1.09 per 100,000 people in 2000 to 2.28 per 100,000 in 2012.   But that doesn’t reflect the true number of out-of-hospital medication errors, Hodges said, because her team counted only mistakes called into poison control centers.   Jody Green, director of research administration at the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center in Denver, said many mistakes could be avoided if consumers read drug labels, and if the labels were easier to read.   “Patients don’t often read the label, even when safety information is present,” she said in a phone interview. “The package inserts that come with prescriptions are often very lengthy. A lot of the time the font is so small that people, especially elderly, can’t read it.”   One in five of the medication errors in the study involved cardiovascular drugs. Cardiovascular drugs accounted for nearly twice as many mistakes as any other category of drugs, and the number of errors increased over the study period by 177 percent.    Hodges attributed the increase in cardiovascular drug mistakes at least in part to an increase in the number of people prescribed beta-blockers and other drugs to control heart disease and blood pressure.   Green, who was not involved with the study, believes a number of private and public initiatives likely have slowed the rate of drug errors since the study ended. She is a member of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s PROTECT Initiative, a task force to advance children’s medication safety.    PROTECT has worked with industry to unify units of measurement on drug containers and instructions, for example, so parents no longer have to try to convert directions given in ounces to drug cups measured in milliliters, or vice-versa, she said.    Nonetheless, more remains to be done, especially to consistently label prescription drugs so consumers know what they’re taking and which other drugs to avoid, she said.   “We need to get away from lengthy pamphlets and think about something that’s more translatable to the general public,” she said.   Hodges advises parents and caregivers to keep a record each time they give a dose of a drug to a child.    “We really recommend that people write it down,” she said. “We recommend keeping a notebook right there with the medication.”   Everyone needs a system to ensure they are taking the right dose of the right medicine at the right time, Hodges said, and added: “Counseling on prescriptions is really important, both by physicians and by pharmacists.”  "
2uZmI2w,2017-07-26,Constant birth support tied to better outcomes for mothers and babies," (Reuters Health) - Mothers who receive continuous support during labor from a partner, friend or hospital worker may be less likely to need pain medications or have a surgical delivery than women who don’t get constant help, a research review suggests.   As a growing number of women in many countries are giving birth in hospitals, having continuous support during labor has become the exception rather than the norm in maternity care, researchers note in the review published by the Cochrane Library.    This type of support can include things like talking to women in labor to provide praise and reassurance, offering massage or warm baths or assistance walking to help them stay comfortable, or advocating for them.   “Supportive care during labor may enhance physiological labor processes, as well as women’s feelings of control and confidence in their own strength and ability to give birth,” said lead study author Meghan Bohren, a researcher with the World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland.    “This may reduce the need for obstetric intervention and also improve women’s experiences,” Bohren said by email.    For the review of existing evidence, Bohren and colleagues examined data from 26 previously published studies with data on more than 15,000 women who labored in a variety of circumstances in 17 countries.    Some women in the studies received continuous labor support from partners, mothers, friends or other family members, while others got this support from nurses, midwives, doulas or other women who weren’t hospital employees.    With continuous support, women were more likely to have vaginal deliveries than when they didn’t have this constant help, the review found.    In addition, women with continuous support were less likely to use pain medications and appeared more likely to have shorter labors and be satisfied with the delivery experience.    Babies born to mothers with continuous support were less likely to have low Apgar scores, an assessment of wellbeing that examines things like breathing and pulse shortly after birth.    Researchers did not, however, find a difference in the odds of babies being admitted to intensive care or being breastfed after two months based on whether or not mothers received continuous birth support.    Benefits of constant support appeared more pronounced in high-income countries than in less affluent nations, and there wasn’t enough evidence to determine how much this helped mothers and babies in low-income countries.    The main limitation of the review was the quality of evidence in the smaller studies was generally low, making it hard to draw broad conclusions from an analysis of multiple research efforts, the authors note.    Even so, the results underscore the potential for mothers and babies alike to benefit from continuous labor support, said Erin M Wright, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing in Baltimore, Maryland, and a practicing midwife at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center.   “This kind of support can help reduce interventions in labor such as medication use for pain relief, which can have a variety of side effects resulting in the need for further interventions,” Wright, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “These can end up resulting in the need for a cesarean delivery or use of forceps or vacuum,” Wright added. “Continuous labor support, however, is the only intervention repeatedly demonstrated to have no adverse effects.”  "
2gOfUiz,2017-07-25,Insulin resistance linked to lower bone density," (Reuters Health) - Decreasing sensitivity to insulin - often associated with obesity and eventual type 2 diabetes - may also cause young adults to have lower bone mass at a time of life when it should be at its peak, Korean researchers say.    With insulin resistance, the body is less effective at using the hormone to get blood sugar into cells for energy, which leads to rising insulin levels.     About 40 percent of bone mass is developed by the late teens, 90 percent by age 18 and peak lifetime bone mass is reached by the late 20s, the study team notes in the journal PLoS One.    Based on a large national survey and physical exams of thousands of men and women aged 25 to 35 years old, Dr. Min Soo Choo of the Mallum University Medical Center in Seoul and colleagues found that the people with the highest levels of insulin resistance had lower bone density than those with healthier insulin processing.   “In order for the body to be able to handle the sugar, we need to produce more and more insulin,” said Dr. Vafa Tabatabaie who wasn’t involved in the study.   “As time goes by, insulin resistance can get worse and it can lead to prediabetes and then type 2 diabetes. That happens when essentially the body fails to keep up with increasing need for insulin,” said Tabatabaie, an endocrinologist at Montefiore Health System in New York.   The new study is interesting, Tabatabaie said in a phone interview, because it suggests that the effect of obesity and insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome on bone health might not just be limited to later life, “which is usually when we start worrying about bone health in older people, but that it actually might start much earlier when people are expected to gain bone during their growth and maturation.”   Information from interviews, physical examinations and nutritional surveys was available for a total of 2,750 young adults who participated in national health surveys between 2008 and 2010.   The exams included data on height, weight, waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height. Lab tests to determine blood sugar, insulin and blood fat levels were also performed, as well as bone scans at several body points to measure bone density.   The researchers divided people into four groups based on their degree of insulin resistance, and found that on average, both men and women in the upper fourth group, with the highest insulin resistance, had lower bone density of the hip, femur and lumbar spine than those in groups one and two.    Because being obese means the body is carrying around extra weight, which strengthens bones, the researchers adjusted for obesity and a variety of diet and lifestyle factors and the link between insulin resistance and less-dense bones remained.   Insulin resistance can be prevented or even treated, Tabatabaie said,”essentially by having a healthy body weight, which means eating a healthy diet with an increase in physical activity, avoiding smoking, and in some patients, medication might also be needed in order to treat insulin resistance and prediabetes.”   Sandra Arevalo, who wasn’t involved in the study, said that to increase bone density it is important to pay attention to your intake of calcium and Vitamin D, among other nutrients, and maintain a healthy weight.   “Dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, cottage cheese and cheese are great sources of calcium. However, you will want to look for reduced-fat versions of these foods to avoid weight gain,” Arevalo, the director of nutrition services and community outreach at Community Pediatrics, a program of Montefiore and The Children’s Health Fund in New York, said in an email.    Beans, almonds, green leafy vegetables (such as kale, collards, spinach and Swiss chard), oatmeal, tofu, sardines and canned salmon with bones are all good sources of calcium, as well, she noted. Vitamin D can be found in oily fish, egg yolks and fortified foods.  "
2vmnrIQ,2017-07-25,Cancer patients in chemo ward may influence each other&#039;s survival," (Reuters Health) - Who a cancer patient spends time with in the chemotherapy ward may have a small but significant effect on their likelihood of surviving the disease, suggests a small study in the UK.   Researchers found that patients who received chemo alongside others who survived for five years or longer were more likely to survive for at least five years themselves, while patients surrounded by peers who survived for less than five years were also more likely to die within five years of their diagnosis.    “Social influence in the chemotherapy ward matters, and specifically it has both positive and negative effects,” lead author Jeff Lienert, a fellow at the U.S. National Human Genome Research Institute’s Social and Behavioral and Research Branch, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “It’s a stronger effect if the time is concentrated among a few people, rather than spread out over a lot of people.”   Cancer patients who receive chemotherapy intravenously typically spend hours in an outpatient clinic or ward as the drug is infused, over the course of several weeks. These wards often have an open design, so patients see others receiving treatment and may interact with them.   Studies have found that cancer patients with stronger social networks may live longer, particularly female patients, Lienert and his team write in the journal Network Science. In the new study, they investigated whether social encounters in the chemotherapy ward might have also an impact on patients’ survival.   They studied patients treated at one UK hospital’s chemo ward, which consisted of two treatment rooms with 10 beds and six chairs arranged in a circle, along with privacy screens.   Lienert and his team used statistical techniques to build a network showing how much time 4,691 patients treated from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2009 spent in one another’s company while receiving treatment.   Among the patients who were in the ward with others who died within five years of chemo, 72 percent also died within five years. But among patients who encountered another patient who survived for five years or longer, 68 percent died within five years.    The researchers estimate that patients who were isolated from others while receiving chemo would have had a 69.5 percent chance of surviving for five years. Thus the effect of spending time with people who survived longer is approximately an extra 2 percent improvement in survival odds. For comparison, choice of chemotherapy drug is estimated to have about an 8 percent effect on survival, the study team notes.   While an extra 2 percent chance of survival compared to isolation may not seem like much, Lienert pointed out, in the current study that added up to about 100 additional survivors.   The researchers tried to account for other factors that might explain this survival difference, including the fact that some patients might have known each other already, so their friendship outside the chemo ward would likely be the source of any positive effects.    Another possibility is that differences in nurses working in the chemo ward at different times have an effect, but if that’s true, then the study detected a “meaningful nurse effect” that hasn’t been previously reported and should be studied further, the authors write.   Most likely, Lienert and his colleagues suggest, the differences they observed are due to stress. It is likely to be stressful to see other cancer patients who are not faring well, while it may ease stress to see others whose treatment seems to be more successful, they explain.   Trying to reorganize chemotherapy wards and patient scheduling in order to take advantage of the findings would be a complex proposition with the potential for unintended consequences, the researcher note. But there are simple ways to take advantage of the social survival boost seen in the study, Lienert said.    For example, cancer survivors could volunteer to spend time with people receiving chemotherapy, and cancer patients can ask a supportive friend or family member to accompany them. “That’s something that patients can control on their own that would take advantage of these results,” Lienert said.  "
2usUI4P,2017-07-24,"Damp, moldy homes tied to adult respiratory problems"," (Reuters Health) - People living in homes with water damage, damp floors or visible mold are more likely to have chronic sinus problems and bronchitis, as well as allergies, asthma and other breathing disorders, according to a large study from Sweden.   Researchers found that about 11 percent of homes had visible signs of dampness - and the more signs were present, the higher the likelihood of residents having nose, throat and lung-related health problems, according to the report in Clinical and Experimental Allergy.   “A lot of papers show an association between asthma-related symptoms and building dampness. What’s new is the association between chronic inflammation and building dampness,” said senior study author Christer Janson of Uppsala University.    “This is an important finding as chronic inflammation is quite a common condition with a very negative side effect on quality of life,” he told Reuters Health by email. “We were surprised that the association with building dampness was so strong.”   The researchers analyzed data from more than 26,000 adults in four Swedish cities who responded to a questionnaire about respiratory symptoms, smoking, education and environmental exposures. In particular, the study team was interested in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), which includes symptoms of runny nose, itchy nose, facial pain, reduced sense of smell, nasal congestion and sneezing.    They identified dampness by asking about visible water damage, floor dampness or visible mold seen in the home during the last 12 months and gave participants a dampness exposure score based on how many of these signs were present.   A total of 2,992 people, or 11.3 percent, reported any signs of dampness. For 8.3 percent of the study participants, one sign was present, for 2.3 percent there were two signs and for 0.7 percent all three signs were seen in the home.   Reported dampness was more common in humid or mild climates, as compared to areas of the country with longer, colder winters. People reporting damp homes were more likely to be women, unemployed or full-time students, smokers and less likely to be retired.   Compared to nonsmokers with no signs of dampness at home, nonsmokers with any dampness signs were 90 percent more likely to have nighttime shortness of breath, 77 percent more likely to have chronic rhinosinusitis and 67 percent more likely to have chronic bronchitis. They also had higher rates of wheeze, nighttime coughing, asthma and allergies.    For chronic rhinosinusitis, the authors note, the degree of increased risk from dampness for nonsmokers was about the same as the effect of smoking for people without dampness in the home.   “I found it both interesting and alarming that the adverse effects were stronger among people with low socioeconomic status due to limited possibilities for moving to a better home or making needed renovations,” said Jouni Jaakkola of the University of Oulu in Finland, who wasn’t involved in the study.    Future studies should look at long-term results to better understand cause and effect with dampness at home, Jaakkola told Reuters Health by email.    “Cross-sectional studies (like this one) may underestimate the effects if people who get symptoms in damp homes change to better homes,” he said. “This probably explains the interaction between socioeconomic status and damp problems.”   Janson and Jaakkola recommended several online resources to help people prevent dampness and mold problems. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has a mold-control primer on EPA.gov ( bit.ly/29fxO4Y ) and so does the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the CDC.gov website ( bit.ly/2lxArWu ). The World Health Organization offers brochures in PDF format on its European website here: ( bit.ly/10VfGJq ) and here: ( bit.ly/2nGrpH4 ).   These resources recommend locating moisture problems, removing molds and controlling excessive water and condensation at home. Leaky pipes and roofs are often the biggest issues, the WHO notes. Professional help may be needed for leaks in building structure, sewage and air ducts, otherwise mold-removal can be done at home with a protective mask, goggles and rubber gloves, according to the EPA.    A mild detergent can remove the mold, followed by a full-room wet wiping or vacuuming after the spores are sealed in a plastic trash bag.   “If there are signs of building dampness in your home or you have water damage, get professional help and try to fix it as soon as possible,” Janson said.  "
2ussOGg,2017-07-24,Parents often make follow-up care mistakes after kids leave hospital," (Reuters Health) - When sick kids leave the hospital, parents often don’t understand what follow-up care is needed or how to give children medicine at home, a research review suggests.    Getting instructions right is essential to avoid mistakes that can prolong children’s illnesses or make them sicker, sometimes so much worse that they need to return to the hospital for additional care, researchers note in Pediatrics.    In the review of 64 studies, medication errors were the most common problem researchers found. For example, up to 38 percent of parents and caregivers didn’t know the right medicine dose and up to 42 percent of them didn’t understand how often children needed to take prescribed drugs.    Dosing errors with prescriptions - when parents gave kids at least 20 percent more or less medication than they were supposed to - occurred 42 percent to 48 percent of the time. The majority of these errors happened with measuring liquid medications that are commonly used for children.    “Underdosing medications may lead to worsening of a child’s illness, while overdosing puts children at risk for dangerous side effects,” said lead study author Dr. Alexander Glick, of New York University School of Medicine and Bellevue Hospital Center in New York.    Parents also frequently misunderstood what follow-up appointments kids needed and what signs of worsening illness would require children to return to the hospital, the study found.    Up to 62 percent of families missed recommended follow-up appointments after kids were discharged from an inpatient hospital stay, as did up to 81 percent of families of children treated in emergency rooms.    Parents were more likely to miss these appointments or fail to schedule them when they had more than one child, lacked private health insurance, spoke little or no English or had difficulty missing work or taking kids out of school for doctor visits, researchers report in Pediatrics.    “When children miss follow-up appointments, they lose the opportunity for additional monitoring, and physicians also cannot ensure that parents are following instructions correctly,” Glick said by email. “Misunderstanding discharge instructions has the potential to lead to unnecessary and unanticipated readmissions and visits to the emergency department.”   Kids were more likely to go to needed follow-up appointments when these visits were scheduled before they left the hospital, the study found.    Medication mistakes were less common when clinicians spent time in the hospital showing parents the correct way to fill medication cups or syringes to give children the right amount of liquid medicine.    Researchers got this snapshot of how well parents understand discharge instructions for their children by analyzing data from studies published between 1985 and 2016. Most were done in the U.S., but some also examined what happens in Canada, Chile, India, Israel, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, Taiwan and Uganda.   One limitation of the current review is that the studies analyzed tended to rely  heavily on research done during the day for convenience, which excludes kids sent home from hospitals on evenings and weekends, the authors note. This may have underestimated how often parents misunderstand instructions because they’re more likely to get help understanding needed follow-up care on weekdays.    Even so, the analysis offers fresh evidence of how often parents fail to follow doctors’ orders for medications and follow-up appointments their kids need, said Dr. Denise Klinkner, medical director of the pediatric trauma center at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.   “This study highlights the overwhelming rate of non-compliance with medications and follow-up,” Klinkner, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Especially for the more complex children, failure to comply may lead to lifelong disability and chronic disease.”   To avoid mistakes, parents should speak up when they don’t understand instructions or when factors like a lack of insurance or transportation might prevent them from getting children needed care, Klinkner added. Clinicians should also keep instructions simple and ask families questions to make sure they understood what they were told.    “A team approach is key,” Klinkner said.   "
2uijHt7,2017-07-21,Want better muscles? More protein may help . . . up to a point," (Reuters Health) - People who regularly do resistance exercises may get stronger and build more lean muscle mass when they add more protein to their diet, a recent study suggests.    Researchers examined data from 49 previously published studies with a total of 1,863 people who did muscle-building workouts like weightlifting. Participants who boosted their protein intake - whether from foods or from supplements like bars, powders and shakes - added more lean muscle mass and got stronger muscles than exercisers who didn’t add extra protein to their diets.    However, increasing daily protein consumption beyond more than 1.6 grams for every kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body weight didn’t appear to have any added benefit.    “Performing resistance exercise is an effective way to maintain or increase lean muscle mass,” said lead study author Robert Morton of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.    “Protein supplementation is sufficient and necessary to augment increases in muscle mass and strength during periods of resistance training,” Morton said by email.    Added protein didn’t help older adults as much as younger people, however.    Also, the benefits of extra protein were more pronounced for newer exercisers than for people with lots of previous experience with resistance training.    All of the studies included in the research review had healthy adults performing resistance exercises at least twice a week. For each study, participants were randomly selected to stick to their usual diets or add extra protein.    Across all these studies, people adding protein to their diets consumed an extra 4 grams to 106 grams daily. Overall, the most common source of added protein was whey protein supplements, followed by supplement blends.    Ten studies gave people added protein with milk, and another seven examined adding protein with whole foods like beef and yogurt.    One limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t have enough data on older adults to determine how much added protein might help these individuals build lean muscle mass, which typically declines with age. Researchers also didn’t look at what happens when dieters get added protein.    “It has been difficult to cultivate one simple message, quantifying how much protein, what types of protein and whether messages should differ among different populations of people,” said Kelsey Mangano, a nutrition researcher at the University of Massachusetts in Lowell who wasn’t involved in the study.    Still, the findings offer fresh insight into the amount of protein some people might add to their diets to get additional benefits from muscle-building workouts, Mangano said by email.    The results might not apply to people who don’t do resistance training at least twice a week, said Dr. Mingyang Song of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston.    Adding protein also isn’t risk-free, Song said by email. It can lead to digestive problems and damage the kidneys, and there’s also some concern that it may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.    “It may result in an imbalanced diet,” Song said. “Thus, a healthy, whole-food based diet should be consumed.”  "
2tjDXb0,2017-07-20,Support at home and in school tied to resilience in child refugees," (Reuters Health) - Refugee kids may fare better in their new country when they have support from a variety of people at home, in school and in their community, a small Australian study suggests.    Researchers followed 43 new arrivals for two to three years and found that kids with at least four so-called protective factors, like a two-parent household, financial security and proximity to their own ethnic community, had better social and emotional wellbeing than refugee children with less support.   Previous research has found refugee children can be highly resilient and adjust well to their new homes, the authors note in the Archives of Disease in Childhood.   “This is very important for us to know as it enables host countries to actively address these factors in order to optimize health and wellbeing in refugee children,” said lead study author Dr. Karen Zwi of the University of New South Wales and Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network.    To foster a more supportive environment for child refugees, host countries might, for example, provide families with housing and financial assistance, help parents find jobs and assist schools in creating supportive environments with sports clubs, homework help and language assistance, Zwi said by email.    “For those more vulnerable children who have fewer protective factors, or are at higher risk for poor social-emotional outcomes, we can provide preventive and proactive support to try to buffer them or protect them to make their outcomes as good as they can be,” Zwi added.    “In the long run, better social-emotional wellbeing is likely to predict improved adult productivity, educational level and overall capacity to give back to the host country,” Zwi said.    For the study, researchers examined data collected on refugee children two and three years after their arrival in Australia between 2009 and 2011. At the start of the study, kids ranged in age from 4 to 17 years old.    After children had been in the country for two years, researchers asked their parents to complete questionnaires designed to assess social and emotional wellbeing and the risk of stress-related illness. Parents were asked to do the same questionnaires again a year later.    Among the children for whom there was data from both questionnaires, all of the kids with at least six protective factors had similar or better results in the second social and emotional wellbeing assessments compared to the first time around.   In contrast, for roughly two-thirds of the kids with only one protective factor wellbeing had deteriorated by the time of the second assessment.    The protective factors that seemed to have the biggest impact on improved wellbeing scores were having a father present when kids arrived in the country, coming from Africa, having relatives in Australia prior to arrival and proximity to their own ethnic community, the study found.    One limitation of the study, however, is that only 39 kids had complete questionnaires at two years and just 38 kids had complete questionnaires after three years. In addition, researchers only had data on protective factors for 31 kids at year two and 33 children at year three.    Even so, the findings highlight the importance of post-immigration factors in shaping how well refugee children adjust to their new country, said Dr. Hamish Graham, a researcher at the Center for International Child Health at the University of Melbourne.    “Other studies have also found that parental psychological wellbeing and family functioning are among the most significant predictors of child health and wellbeing, and this has certainly been my experience working with refugee children and families,” Graham, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “Refugee families commonly experience ongoing stress due to financial hardship, housing, making social connections, and navigating new school, health and social service systems,” Graham added. “As a society, we should view support for families through these challenges as an important investment in their social and emotional wellbeing.”  "
2uNbfDS,2017-07-20,Mothers who breastfeed might have lower multiple sclerosis risk," (Reuters Health) - Women who breastfeed may have a lower risk of developing multiple sclerosis later in life compared to mothers who don’t nurse their infants, a recent U.S. study suggests.    Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a rare, disabling autoimmune disease that damages the central nervous system and predominantly develops in women of childbearing age. It can lead to fatigue, pain, vision loss and impaired coordination and motor skills.     For the current study, researchers examined data on total breastfeeding duration after all pregnancies for 397 mothers newly diagnosed with MS or a precursor condition and a control group of 433 mothers who were similar in age, race, income, education and smoking history who didn’t have MS.    Compared with women who breastfed for a total of no more than four months, mothers who nursed babies for at least 15 months were 53 percent less likely to develop MS, the study found.    “This study opens up the possibility that along with reducing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, ovarian and breast cancer, breastfeeding particularly for longer durations may also reduce the risk of multiple sclerosis and possibly other autoimmune diseases,” said lead study author Dr. Annette Langer-Gould, a neurology researcher with Kaiser Permanente in Pasadena, California.    Why breastfeeding might reduce the risk of MS is unclear.    One theory is that shifts in sex hormone levels with pregnancy and breastfeeding might play a role, and another possible explanation is that a lack of ovulation might play a role, researchers note in the journal Neurology.    To test these ideas, researchers looked at the total number of years women spent ovulating based on the age they began menstruating, the total time they spent pregnant or nursing, and in some cases their age at menopause.    They didn’t find an association between the duration of ovulation and the risk of developing MS, however. The number of pregnancies, use of hormonal contraceptives, and the age women gave birth for the first time also didn’t appear to influence the odds of getting MS.    Starting menstruation at a younger age did appear to raise risk. Women who were 15 or older when they got their first period were 44 percent less likely to develop MS as women who were 11 or younger when they began menstruating, the study found.    Overall, 85 women without MS breastfed for at least 15 months, compared to just 44 of the mothers with MS.    In contrast, 110 women without MS breastfed for no more than four months, compared to 118 women with MS.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how breastfeeding might protect against MS. Other limitations include the lack of data on why some women didn’t breastfeed at all or did so only for a few months, the authors note.    Breastfeeding might curb the risk of MS by reducing pro-inflammatory activity, however, this area has not been carefully studied by basic scientists,” Langer-Gould said by email.    Because very few women who choose to breastfeed are unable to do it for biological reasons, it’s unlikely that an inability to produce milk would explain the study findings, Langer-Gould added.   “It is possible that women who choose to breastfeed, particularly for longer durations, lead an overall healthier lifestyle and that another aspect of a healthy lifestyle that we did not measure could explain these findings,” she said.   “Even if the reasons aren’t yet clear, the study strengthens the body of evidence suggesting that breastfeeding influences MS, said Dr. Patricia Coyle, director of the MS Comprehensive Care Center Stony Brook University Medical Center in New York.    “This is further evidence of a potential benefit of breastfeeding: to avoid future immune mediated disease,” Coyle, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “But most important is trying to understand why breastfeeding has this impact on MS risk.”  "
2uzPCGt,2017-07-19,Kids still getting hurt riding ATVs despite safety warnings," (Reuters Health) - Even though pediatricians warn parents not to let children under 16 ride all-terrain vehicles, young kids are still getting injured and killed in ATV crashes, a U.S. study suggests.     Since 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that ATV use be restricted to youth aged 16 years and older who wear helmets, don’t take passengers and steer clear of roads. Despite these guidelines, the mortality rate from ATV crashes for kids under 18 doesn’t appear to have budged in recent years, researchers report in Pediatrics.    “Too many young children are driving these machines - equivalent to a motorcycle in many ways,” said senior study author Dr. William Hennrikus, medical director of the Pediatric Bone and Joint Clinic at Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania.    “Children should not drive an ATV until they’re over 16, just like driving a motorcycle,” Hennrikus said by email. “Helmets should always be worn, just like a motorcycle.”   For the study, researchers examined data on 1,912 patients under age 18 who were injured while using an ATV and treated at trauma centers in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2014.    During this period, 28 children died in ATV crashes, a mortality rate of roughly one per every 100,000 kids in the population, researchers calculated.    The injury rate dropped slightly during the study period, from 6.7 kids per 100,000 children in the population over the first five years to 5.8 kids per 100,000 over the second half of the decade. But the decline wasn’t large enough to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    Overall, less than half of the kids were wearing helmets and a street or roadway was the crash location in 15 percent of cases.    Being a passenger or being pulled by the ATV was a factor in almost one in four injuries, the study also found.    Half of the kids involved in ATV crashes were 14 or younger, and about 6 percent were no more than 5 years old.    Boys accounted for three in every four patients.    The majority of patients, 55 percent, sustained at least one bone fracture at or below the cervical spine, which is the upper part of the spinal column near the neck. Most often, fractures occurred in major bones in the thigh and shin.    Limitations of the study include the possibility that researchers underestimated injuries and deaths because they only looked at trauma center patients, not children who were treated elsewhere or died before they ever reached a trauma center.    But the findings still underscore the urgency of keeping young children off ATVs and making sure teen drivers follow safety recommendations, said David Schwebel, a sports injury researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Helmets absolutely have to be used for any ride, even short, apparently safe ones,” Schwebel said by email. “Passengers should never ride on ATVs unless the ATV is designed for more than one person.”   Previous research suggests that ATVs cause slightly more injuries than scooters, snow skiing and combative sports like karate, softball and hockey, Schwebel added. However, the vehicles are responsible for slightly fewer injuries than swimming, lacrosse and gymnastics, and they cause far fewer injuries than football or soccer.   Schwebel recommends “ATVs and Youth: Matching Children and Vehicles,” a tip sheet from Penn State for information about ATV safety (here:  bit.ly/2qdV9hf ).   Age isn’t all parents should consider when deciding whether to let kids get behind the wheel of an ATV, Schwebel added.   “Parents need to think not just about their child’s size, but also their ability to think, to react to emergency situations and to maintain safe, cautious control of a very powerful vehicle,” Schwebel said.

2t8mF0o,2017-07-18,High rates of respiratory problems linked to indoor lifeguard work," (Reuters Health) - Lifeguards who spend more than 500 hours a year working at indoor pools are two to six times more likely than colleagues who are exposed less often to have coughs, asthma, and throat and eye irritation, according to a small study in Canada.   Most of the symptoms improved after the lifeguards left work, suggesting that chemicals used to maintain indoor pools may be triggering the symptoms, the study authors report in the International Journal of Environmental Health Research.   “In the past years, in the province of Quebec as well as in other jurisdictions, lifeguards’ and competitive swimmers’ awareness of potential irritative effects related to indoor swimming pools increased,” lead author Gabrielle Bureau told Reuters Health in an email.   “However, this study clearly highlights the fact that indoor swimming pool environments may have adverse health effects on the respiratory system and suggest a relationship between respiratory symptoms and the time spent in this environment as a lifeguard,” said Bureau,  a researcher at the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine of Laval University in Quebec City.   The researchers surveyed current and former licensed lifeguards using online questionnaires to assess their exposure to swimming pool environments and certain symptoms such as cough, sputum, shortness of breath, wheezing, lung congestion, sneezing, throat or eye irritation, hoarseness, stuffy nose and ear pain.    In addition, the lifeguards were asked if they had been diagnosed with asthma or used asthma medications.    Of the 870 respondents, 601 were currently working as lifeguards and three quarters were women. Their ages ranged from 18 to 64 years, with an average age of 22 for current lifeguards and 29 for former lifeguards.    About 78 percent of the lifeguards reported having at least one respiratory symptom in the previous year and 23 percent reported having physician-diagnosed asthma.    Lifeguards exposed to the pool more than 500 hours during the previous year were about two and a half times more likely to have a cough or sore throat than those exposed less than 50 hours. They were also over four times more likely to have eye irritation.    Among lifeguards with asthma, those exposed more than 500 hours a year were six times more likely to have asthma attacks than those with little or no exposure to the indoor pool environment.   “We found that the most exposed lifeguards in the past 12 months were more susceptible to have a cough, hoarseness and throat and eye irritation during this period. Furthermore, we found that most exposed lifeguards over their lifetime had significantly more chances of suffering from various symptoms while on duty,” Bureau said.   “Most of the swimming pools worldwide are disinfected with chlorine-based disinfectants,” she noted.   The reaction between free chlorine and organic matter such as sloughed skin cells, cosmetics, urine, sunscreen and sweat in water generates a high number of contaminants called disinfection-by-products (DBP), Bureau said.   “One of those DBPs is the trichloramine (NCl3), a highly volatile contaminant that gives indoor swimming pools their characteristic ‘chlorine smell,’” she said, and NCl3 is the most likely contaminant to cause irritative symptoms.    “The present findings underscore the need to implement and respect preventive measures. To that extent, it is important to limit the entry of organic matter into the water to decrease the amount of disinfection-by-products generated,” she said.   Taking specific hygiene measures such as using the toilet and showering with soap before swimming, using swimming caps, taking children to the toilet frequently, using diapers specially designed for swimming would be important, Bureau said.   “Moreover, measures like adequate filtration, tight chlorination control, regular monitoring of chlorination parameters, adequate ventilation at all times are essential to improve water and air quality in indoor swimming pools and prevent the occurrence of irritative and respiratory symptoms,” she said.  "
2uFNj55,2017-07-18,Absent dads tied to stress-related cellular changes in kids," (Reuters Health) - The loss of a father due to death, divorce or jail is associated with children having shorter caps on the ends of their chromosomes, according to a study that points to a possible biological explanation for health problems often encountered by kids with absent dads.   The protective caps known as telomeres shrink with age, and are also thought to erode with extreme stress.   At age 9, kids who had lost a father had 14 percent shorter telomeres than children whose dad was still involved in their lives, researchers report in Pediatrics. Death had the biggest impact, and the association was stronger for boys than for girls.    “While we know that disparate stressors - smoking, maltreatment, intense caregiving, etc - are associated with shorter telomeres, the biological link is not well established and is the subject of investigation in several labs,” said senior study author Dr. Daniel Notterman, a molecular biology researcher at Princeton University in New Jersey.   “It is plausible to consider that children who have stress-induced telomere shortening may be at risk for future health problems, but many other factors play a role in a person’s adult health and lifespan,” Notterman said by email.    The loss of a father is widely known to impair a child’s physical and psychological functioning, and the connection between absent dads and health problems for kids is well documented, researchers note. However, less is known about the exact biological causes of medical issues kids with absent dads can encounter.   Telomeres shorten each time a cell divides. Once telomeres are too short, cell growth stops, which is why their length is considered a potential indicator of cellular aging and overall health.    Some previous research has linked shorter telomeres to an increased risk of a variety of chronic health problems in adults, including heart disease and cancer.    For the current study, researchers examined data on family structure and tests of telomere length from saliva samples for 2,420 kids in 20 large American cities.    When a father died, children had 16 percent shorter telomeres than kids with a dad still in their life, the study found.    Losing a dad to incarceration was associated with 10 percent shorter telomeres, while a father absent because of separation or divorce was linked to 6 percent shorter telomeres.    The impact of missing fathers on telomere length didn’t appear to differ by race or ethnicity.   Boys with an absent dad, however, were more vulnerable to shorter telomeres than girls, particularly if boys lost their father before age 5, the study also found.    Researchers also looked at whether certain alleles, or versions of specific genes, might influence the odds of an absent dad being associated with shorter telomeres. Differences in gene variants related to levels of serotonin, a brain chemical responsible for mood, may partially explain why some kids with absent dads are more likely than others to have shorter telomeres, the researchers conclude.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how absent dads directly contribute to shorter telomeres in kids or cause any specific health problems, the authors note. It’s also possible that a variety of factors not examined in the study, such as mothers’ parenting quality, might influence whether kids develop shorter telomeres after the loss of a father.   Even so, since shorter telomeres are a marker of cellular aging, the study results suggest a biological link between early adversity and a risk for a range of chronic physical illnesses, said Dr. David Brent, chief of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.   “This is important,” Brent said, because there is evidence that meditation can help buffer the effects of adversity. “So that for individuals with exposure to early adversity, such interventions could in theory actually prevent or attenuate chronic illnesses,” Brent, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    With death in particular, counseling both mothers and children can help prevent the loss of a father from impacting kids’ health, Brent added. Previous research has shown just a dozen sessions focused on parenting skills and child coping can encourage better discipline practices and the open expression of grief.   “There is evidence that strengthening families can buffer against the effects of the death of a parent,” Brent said.   "
2vfKCo6,2017-07-18,Blood sugar swings tied to depression in elderly with type 2 diabetes," (Reuters Health) - Greater ups and downs of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a marker of long-term blood sugar levels, are associated with a higher number of symptoms of depression in elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes, a recent Israeli study finds.   “The results suggest that maintaining stability in glycemic (‘blood sugar’) control may be important for prevention of depressive symptoms in elderly diabetic patients,” Dr. Ramit Ravona-Springer from Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, and Tel-Aviv University told Reuters Health.   People with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely as people without diabetes to develop depression, which affects as many as a third of individuals 65 years and older. Variability in HbA1c has been associated with complications of diabetes, but there is little information about its relationship with depression, the study team writes in Diabetes Care.   Ravona-Springer’s team analyzed about nine years’ worth of data on 837 people with type 2 diabetes whose average age was nearly 73 years. The information included around 18 HbA1c measurements over the years for each participant, and results from a depression assessment at the start of the study period.   Average HbA1c was not associated with depressive symptoms, but the variability of HbA1c measurements was, such that each 1 percent increase in variability was associated with a 29 percent increase in the number of depressive symptoms, researchers found.   The relationship between HbA1c variability was true regardless of HbA1c level, but it was strongest among people whose HbA1c was above 7 percent, a common target for blood sugar control.    The researchers admit that the results just show an association and don’t necessarily mean that blood sugar variability causes symptoms of depression.    Nevertheless, they conclude that better long-term stability of HbA1c - in other words, more consistent blood sugar control - might help to prevent depression in elderly people with type 2 diabetes.    “This study is ongoing,” Ravona-Springer said. “We thus expect to have even better understanding of the directional relationships of glycemic control and other diabetes-related characteristics with depression as we start analyzing longitudinal data,” she said in an email.    “The study hints at the importance of achieving stable A1c values at a certain age/point in a patient’s diabetes history in contrast to trying to reduce A1c,” said Dr. Dominic Ehrmann from the Research Institute of the Diabetes Academy Mergentheim (FIDAM) in Bad Mergentheim, Germany, who has also studied the link between depression and diabetes.    “But (and this is a big but) this must be weighed against other clinical and medical objectives (e.g., complications, comorbidities, cognitive functioning),” he said by email.    “Depression/depressive symptoms should be an important factor in clinical decision making in elderly patients,” concluded Ehrmann, who wasn’t involved in the current study. “That is, the impact of therapy adjustments or changing treatment goals on depressive symptoms should be considered in clinical practice.”   "
2uzjUJf,2017-07-18,Mosquitoes less likely than people to spread disease via air travel," Human travelers are much more likely than stowaway mosquitoes to import illnesses like Zika, yellow fever, malaria and dengue to a new part of the world via airplane, researchers say.   Based on calculations of how many mosquitoes get onto commercial aircraft, how many are infected and how many survive long enough at the destination to bite someone, the study estimates human travelers are 200 times more likely to spread dengue virus and 1,000 times more likely to introduce P. falciparum, the parasite that causes malaria .   “Pathogens such as the Zika virus and chikungunya have drawn a lot of interest lately and are showing up in travelers,” said senior study author Michael Johansson, a biologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Division of Vector-Borne Diseases in San Juan, Puerto Rico.    Insects that transport disease, such as mosquitoes, have been introduced via airlines to geographic areas where they didn’t previous live, the authors write in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Airports have insect-elimination, or “disinsection,” policies mandated by the UN’s International Health Regulations. They typically use insecticides to try to kill insects in bags, cargo, containers and conveyor belts, but infections still occur.   “We’ve had disinsection policies for a long time, which are targeted at mosquito species and agricultural pests,” Johansson told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “But we need to focus on ways to prevent the spread through humans.”   The study team assessed scenarios for the spread of mosquito-borne diseases, focusing on areas where either malaria or dengue are “endemic,” or widespread, and places where the diseases are not endemic, but conditions are favorable for them to establish themselves.   Based on past studies, the researchers calculated how many mosquitoes would likely be on any given plane, and how many of them would be infected with disease. For instance, the largest number of mosquitoes ever detected on a plane in past research is 17 Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, the primary transmitters of malaria, the researchers note. For the current study, they estimated a 0.25 probability of any mosquito on a given flight, or an average of one mosquito on every fourth plane.   They also calculated the infection rates for human travelers, likelihood of mosquito bites at the destination and probability of disease transmission to a new person.   Even in the absence of mosquito control or disinsection on planes, humans were hundreds of times more likely to spread the diseases through travel. Overall, the probability that an airplane traveling from a mosquito-heavy area would lead to infection was extremely low.   “We expected to find this, but we were surprised by the magnitude,” Johansson said. “We didn’t think it would be so obvious, and this was focusing on the worst-case scenarios.”   Future studies should focus on preventing human transmission, he added. Policies around preventing the transportation of infected mosquitoes won’t likely work, the study authors conclude.   “There may be a misperception about how pathogens disperse globally,” said Moritz Kraemer of Harvard Medical School in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “With the increase in travel globally, infectious diseases spread quickly from one location to another,” he told Reuters Health by email.     Kraemer, who recently published a study in the journal Nature about the multiple introductions of Zika virus to Florida ( go.nature.com/2tmKLJ4 ), suggests creating maps of the geographic areas where people are infected and their airports to better target disease. Pathways and directionality is also important, he added.    “One aspect that is still difficult to assess is which travelers are at highest risk of infection,” he said. “The most exciting thing about this study is that it shows the differences between dengue and malaria and the risk of mosquito versus human-driven importation.”  "
2tkmP93,2017-07-17,Tobacco companies diversify into ‘pharmaceuticals’," (Reuters Health) - Tobacco companies claim to be developing and selling merchandise to help cigarette smokers quit, but health researchers accuse the industry of trying to hook consumers on different – still dangerous – nicotine products.   Writing in Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) call the industry’s push into the smoking-cessation market “the pharmaceuticalization of the tobacco industry.”    “The same hand that’s creating the problem is attempting to create the solution,” lead author Yogi Hendlin said in a phone interview. “But their solution is long-term nicotine maintenance, rather than total tobacco cessation.”   Marketing tobacco-industry merchandise as pharmaceutical products and devices threatens to endanger public health and to derail decades of progress in educating the public about the risks of smoking, his team’s opinion piece says.   “Tobacco companies see their future as pharmaceutical companies. They’ve already begun to acquire pharmaceutical subsidiaries, and they’re producing tobacco products that look and feel like medicines,” senior author Dr. Pamela Ling, a professor of medicine at UCSF, said in a phone interview.   The authors define “pharmaceuticalization” as the tobacco industry’s “actual and perceived transition into a pharmaceutical-like industry through the manufacture and sale of noncombustible tobacco and nicotine products for smoking cessation or long-term nicotine maintenance without the testing and oversight required of traditional pharmaceutical products.”   The effort confuses consumers, complicates the regulatory process and legitimizes the tobacco industry as a healthcare partner, they say.   In response, Philip Morris International told Reuters Health in a statement that it understood that some might question its motives.   “At the same time we are very encouraged by the growing number of experts and health authorities who believe that tobacco companies like us have a key role to play in reducing the harm caused by smoking,” the statement said.    “We are making significant efforts so that all those who would otherwise continue smoking switch to scientifically substantiated smoke-free alternatives as soon as possible,” it said. “We do not ask to be trusted but to be judged based on facts.”   Ling, Hendlin and their coauthor Jesse Elias say the pharmaceuticalization of tobacco relies on two false assumptions: substantial numbers of smokers cannot quit, and the only way most smokers could quit would be with the help of pharmacotherapy.    As many as 90 percent of smokers who stop smoking do so cold turkey, without cessation aids, said Hendlin, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF’s Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education.   But quitting cold turkey is easier said than done for a substantial group of smokers, particularly smokers coping with substance abuse and other mental health issues, said Donna Vallone, chief research officer at Truth Initiative’s Schroeder Institute, a Washington, D.C. nonprofit dedicated to ending youth smoking.    “Believe me, it’s right to worry about the industry’s objectives here,” she said by phone.   “On the other hand, we do believe that harm reduction is a legitimate public-health strategy. When you’re a lifetime committed smoker and you’re trying to quit, these products can be helpful to you,” said Vallone, who was not involved in the commentary.   All the major transnational tobacco companies have invested in so-called pharmaceuticalized tobacco products, according to the commentary authors.   In December, Philip Morris submitted a multimillion-page application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking to certify a new product – I Quit Ordinary Smoking, or IQOS – as having “modified risk” compared to cigarettes.    IQOS includes short, disposable tobacco sticks soaked in propylene glycol and inserted in a heat-not-burn cigarette, which, like e-cigarettes, exempts it from smoking laws in many countries. A recent study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that the product releases chemicals linked to cancer, sometimes in higher concentrations than conventional cigarettes.    If approved by the FDA, IQOS would become the country’s first modified-risk, or reduced-harm, tobacco product.   Smoke from IQOS cigarettes releases 84 percent of the nicotine found in traditional cigarettes, the JAMA Internal Medicine study found.    “While the tobacco industry seeks to glamorize, normalize and rationalize nicotine addiction, don’t be fooled: nicotine is a potently addictive and harmful drug,” said Mark Travers, a researcher at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York.    “Our ultimate goal will always be to end tobacco use AND nicotine addiction,” said Travers, who was not involved with the commentary, in an email. “Yes, pharmaceutical nicotine, as approved by the FDA, is an effective way to assist in stopping smoking, but complete abstinence of tobacco and nicotine use is the best outcome.”  "
2u2P9vF,2017-07-17,9/11 survivors face higher risk of heart and lung problems," (Reuters Health) - Survivors of the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York City on September 11, 2001 - and first-responders who were on the scene that day - may have an increased risk for heart and lung diseases, a new study suggests.    The World Trade Center attack exposed thousands of people to intense concentrations of hazardous materials that have resulted in reports of increased levels of asthma, heart disease, diabetes and other chronic physical and psychological disorders, researchers note in the journal Injury Epidemiology.    For the current study, researchers examined data on 8,701 people who were at the World Trade Center site on the day of the attacks and didn’t have asthma, diabetes or heart and lung diseases.    After up to 11 years of follow-up, people injured that day were at least twice as likely to develop heart disease as people who didn’t sustain injuries, the study found. Dust and debris exposure was associated with 30 percent higher odds of developing asthma and lung diseases, the study also found.    “This study is unique in that it focuses on responders and survivors who had intense exposure to environmental pollution and trauma on 9/11/2001 in New York City, but not afterwards,” said senior study author Dr. Robert Brackbill of the World Trade Center Health Registry and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.   “The main implication of these findings is that intense exposure on the first day of the disaster can by itself increase the risk of developing chronic conditions,” Brackbill said by email.    Researchers examined data on 8,701 people in the WTC Health Registry, which monitors the physical and mental health of 71,431 individuals exposed to the attacks. The current study included people with the most exposure to injuries and contaminated air that day: 7,503 area workers, 249 rescue workers, 131 residents and 818 people on the surrounding streets.    Overall, 41 percent of the people in the study had intense exposure to the dust cloud on 9/11, 10 percent had a single injury, 2 percent had two injuries and 1 percent had three or more injuries.    Over the next decade, 92 people developed heart disease, 327 got diagnosed with diabetes, 308 had a new asthma diagnosis, and 297 developed lung diseases that didn’t involve tumors.    When people had multiple injuries, such as fractures, head injuries or sprains, their risk of having chest pains or a heart attack was higher than when they only had one type of injury, study also found.     Dust exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder and being a rescue worker, as well as current smoking were associated with a higher risk developing lung diseases that were not cancer or asthma, the study also found.    Dust exposure on its own, however, wasn’t associated with an increased risk of asthma.    Limitations of the study include the high proportion of participants who dropped out over time, the authors note. Researchers also lacked data on the severity of injuries or how people were treated.    “While law enforcement and fire fighters may be used to disasters, certainly this was an unprecedented disaster even for trained people,” said Dr. Iris Udasin, director of the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute at Rutgers University in New Jersey.    “One lesson that we learned is that people shouldn’t rush into a disaster without proper training and equipment,” Udasin, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “There are a number of volunteers that wanted to help and ended up getting sick from their exposures.”  "
2tel1xX,2017-07-14,Dying veterans boost participation in hospice care," (Reuters Health) - An initiative to enroll dying veterans in hospice care appears to be working, and its success may offer clues for how to persuade others who are terminally ill to join the highly lauded end-of-life program, a new study shows.   After the U.S. Veterans Administration implemented its Comprehensive End of Life Care Initiative in 2009, growth of enrollment of terminally ill male war veterans in hospice care outstripped enrollment growth in hospice programs for elderly men who did not serve, according to the report in Health Affairs.   More veterans likely enrolled in hospice care because the initiative allowed them to continue to have curative treatments, said Joanne Spetz, a professor at the Institute for Health Policy Studies at the University of California, San Francisco. Other hospice programs require participants to cease disease-modifying treatment.   Spetz suspects that being able to use both hospice and concurrent care motivated people to sign up for hospice care “because it wasn’t an either/or decision,” she said in a phone interview.   Deciding to forego chemotherapy, radiation or any other possible curative treatments can be difficult for patients and families, said Spetz, who was not involved in the study.    “There’s fear that if I sign up for hospice, I’ve given up,” she said. “It’s also hard for the physician, who’s trained that death is a loss.”   Researchers compared hospice use among more than 1.1 million male veterans ages 65 and older between 2007 and 2014 with more than 140,000 demographically similar Medicare beneficiaries not enrolled in VA healthcare.    By 2011, they found that 44 percent of veterans who died in hospitals took their last breaths in hospice beds, compared to 30 percent in 2008. By 2012, 71 percent of veterans dying of cancer were enrolled in hospice.   Lead author Susan Miller, a professor at the Brown University School of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island, and her team structured the study to examine whether the VA initiative drove growth beyond that in the general Medicare population.   Before the initiative, veterans were 15 percent less likely than non-veterans to go into hospice, Miller said in a phone interview. Today, they’re 2.4 percent more likely.   The VA initiative focused on increases in palliative and hospice care. By 2012, the VA had installed 54 new hospice and palliative-care inpatient units, the authors write.   Elderly men who were not veterans increased hospice use by 5.6 percent between 2007 and 2014, while older male veterans increased hospice use by 7.6 percent, the study found.    Previous studies repeatedly document that dying people receive higher-quality end-of-life care with hospice, the authors write.   “Numerous studies show hospice improves quality of care and results in less aggressive and undesired care, such as emergency room visits and hospitalizations near the end of life,” Miller said.    “The quality is better, and families feel it’s better,” she said.   Spetz applauded the VA initiative for its concerted effort to provide palliative-care and hospice staff across the country. But she wondered if the effort could be reproduced in other healthcare systems.   “If you tried to implement this program in a community program, it would be a lot harder,” she said. “It speaks well for integration of care because many people have very, very fragmented care. Could you really pull this off outside the VA?”   The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is currently testing a hospice program that allows curative care to continue, called the Medicare Care Choices Model.   Miller believes conversations between patients and clinicians soon after a diagnosis of serious illness are key.   “The VA’s having discussions with veterans earlier to understand preferences and to meet their needs,” she said.    “It’s the conversations that are so important,” she said. “The VA is trying to have more of these conversations and document the preferences earlier.”  "
2uvkTKk,2017-07-17,Artificial sweeteners may not be risk free," People hoping to lose a few pounds by substituting artificial sweeteners for regular sugar may end up disappointed, suggests a fresh look at past research.   The review of 37 studies suggests the use of so-called non-nutritive sweeteners could be linked to weight gain and other undesirable outcomes like high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes.   “From all that research, there was no consistent evidence of a long term benefit from the sweetener, but there was evidence for weight gain and increased risks of other cardiometabolic outcomes,” said lead author Meghan Azad, of the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada.   Artificial sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose and stevioside are growing increasingly popular as evidence mounts that sugar is fueling the obesity epidemic, Azad and colleagues write in CMAJ.   The artificial sweeteners are chemically different than sugar. They activate receptors on the tongue that lets the brain know the person is eating or drinking something sweet.   Past research on these sweeteners shows a mixed bag of results, including links to weight gain, as well as links to weight loss, according to the authors of the new review.   For the analysis, they looked through the medical literature for studies examining possible links between artificial sweeteners and weight or health issues like obesity.   The researchers found seven randomized controlled trials, which are considered the gold-standard of medical research. Some of the trials, for example, compared people who drank artificially sweetened beverages to people who drank water. The researchers also found 30 studies that followed people using the sweeteners over time.   They found no link between the use of artificial sweeteners and changes in body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of weight in relation to height, among the 1,003 people in the randomized controlled trials. They also didn’t find a link between the sweeteners and other outcomes.   Among the 405,907 people included in the 30 other studies, the researchers found that artificial sweeteners were tied to a small increase in BMI, weight, waist size, obesity, high blood pressure, heart problems and metabolic syndrome.   “I think it’s cause for some caution and rethinking whether or not these products are without any effect,” Azad told Reuters Health.    The researchers caution, however, that the studies that followed people over time may be biased since artificial sweeteners are promoted as a treatment for conditions like obesity or diabetes. Also, the randomized controlled trials were relatively short.   Azad also said they were not able to look at individual sweeteners.   “It’s possible that different sweeteners have different effects, but we were not able to examine that because of the studies available,” she said.   The risks and benefits of these sweeteners need to be evaluated, but the science examining those benefits is lacking, said Sai Das of the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston, who was not involved with the new study.   “It is time for the science to look at what - if any - benefits there are to see if that is meaningful enough to outweigh the risks that have been highlighted,” Das told Reuters Health.   Until there is better research, Das said, people should use be cautious about using artificial sweeteners.  "
2u1xPIe,2017-07-14,Less stress might mean lower blood sugar for overweight women," (Reuters Health) - An eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program not only reduces stress, but could also lower blood sugar, U.S. researchers say.   “Our study suggests that MBSR could be a useful tool for preventing or treating diabetes in patients with overweight or obesity,” lead author Dr. Nazia Raja-Khan from Penn State College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania, said by email.   MBSR, an intensive instructor-led training program, incorporates meditation, body awareness and other anxiety-reducing techniques. It was originally developed decades ago at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester to help patients manage pain and stress while being treated for cancer and other serious illnesses, but the course is now offered in a wide variety of settings nationwide.    MBSR training has been shown to reduce stress and therefore might reduce the risk of heart disease in overweight or obese individuals, though this has yet to be proven, Raja Khan’s team writes in the journal Obesity.   The researchers assigned 86 women to eight weeks of either MBSR training or a health education program focusing on diet and exercise. They told both groups that the main focus of the study was stress reduction.    After eight weeks and again after 16 weeks, they compared changes in stress levels, mood, quality-of-life, sleep quality, blood pressure, blood sugar, weight and other measures.    Not surprisingly, after eight weeks, the MSBR group had a greater improvement in mindfulness and a greater decrease in feelings of stress, compared with the health education group. Perceived stress remained lower in the MBSR group after 16 weeks.    Women in the MBSR group also had lower blood sugar, by about 9 milligrams per deciliter of blood, after eight and 16 weeks compared to before the training, while women in the health education group had no change in blood sugar.    After MBSR or health education, both groups had less overall psychological stress, less anxiety and better sleep, but neither group had lost weight, lowered their inflammation or cholesterol levels or improved their responses to insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar.    “Further studies are needed to determine more long-term benefits of MBSR in overweight/obesity and to confirm the role of MBSR in diabetes prevention and treatment,” Raja-Khan told Reuters Health.

2tKgKSJ,2017-07-14,Financial scams target millions of older Americans annually," One in 18 older Americans falls victim to financial fraud or scams annually, and that figure excludes seniors who’ve been financially abused by friends and relatives, a new study finds.   “We’re talking about millions of older adults each year,” said lead author David Burnes, a gerontologist, social worker and professor at the University of Toronto in Canada. “What’s worse, it’s very likely an underestimate.”   The report in the American Journal of Public Health estimates that 5.4 percent of older adults experience some form of fraud or scam each year.    The estimate includes only seniors living on their own and excludes those in institutional settings and most who are cognitively impaired. Complicating the count, Burnes said in a Skype interview, is the fact that victims tend to underreport the scams.    Burnes and his team divided financial exploitation of older adults into two categories: financial fraud and scams perpetrated by strangers or others outside of conventional positions of trust; and financial abuse perpetrated by those in positions of trust, generally friends and relatives.    They reviewed 12 studies involving nearly 42,000 community-dwelling older adults and determined that in every five-year period, an estimated 5.6 percent of older adults are a target of a financial fraud, and 5.4 percent are targeted within one year.    The swindles run the gamut from online romance to counterfeit prescription drug scams, Burnes said.    “Scammers will target and prey on older adults who are lonely, socially isolated, and will develop an online relationship and over time will ask them to send money over and over again,” he said.    Most of the studies defined older adults as being at least 65 years old, but two included people as young as 50.    The studies covered scams pertaining to investments, products and services, employment, prizes and identity theft.   Victims often are unable to detect differences between legitimate email calls for help from relatives, for example, and scammers, Burnes said. Victims frequently send money overseas, complicating law-enforcement and recovery efforts across borders, he said.   The authors call on researchers and policymakers to explore ways to prevent financial scams and for healthcare professionals to screen elders for vulnerability to scams during wellness visits.   Dr. Eric Widera, a geriatrics specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the new study, agrees that physicians should screen for vulnerability.    “I do agree that physicians should play a role in helping patients by recognizing the signs of possible impaired financial capacity and recognizing elder abuse, because it’s more common than we often think and because it impacts their health and wellbeing,” he said in an email.   “Unfortunately, while there are a number of elder-abuse screening instruments out there, not all screen for financial abuse, and very little if any screen for scams and fraud,” he said.   Widera fears the new report failed to capture many instances of financial fraud and scams, especially in the most vulnerable.   A previous recent study estimated the one-year prevalence of elder financial abuse in relationships of trust as 4.5 percent. Given that elders could be targeted for both financial abuse and financial fraud or scams, the authors believe nearly 10 percent of older Americans may be subject to some form of financial exploitation each year.   Both doctors and consumers tend to overlook elders’ declining ability to manage their own financial affairs, one of the most common and devastating problems of aging, a 2015 report in the Annals of Internal Medicine found.    The authors of that report, Dr. Mark Lachs of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York and Duke Han of Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, coined the term “age-associated financial vulnerability” to encourage physicians to consider the issue with their patients.    Financial fraud victims may suffer serious health consequences, including major depression, anxiety and premature mortality, the authors of the new study write. Most victims also report feeling anger, stress, betrayal, embarrassment, helplessness and shame.   In addition, victims of elder financial fraud and scams suffer financial losses from which they may never be able to recover.  "
2vh1ZnG,2017-07-13,"Concussion is a concern for para athletes, too"," (Reuters Health) - Para athletes often engage in sports where there is an increased risk of concussion, but there are no established standards for assessing, managing or preventing concussion in these athletes.   This situation needs to change, Dr. Nick Webborn and colleagues on the medical committee of the International Paralympic Committee write in an editorial in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.   “The profile of the issue of concussion in sport has received much media attention, but none of this has considered the issues surrounding the para athlete,” Webborn, from University of Brighton’s Center for Sport and Exercise Science and Medicine in the UK, told Reuters Health.    “We face many challenges in improving the care of the head-injured para athlete. By raising awareness, we can stimulate researchers to assist us with protecting the health of these athletes,” he said by email.   During the Rio Paralympic Games, there were 10 reported significant head and facial injuries, but concussion was not reported in any of them, despite “suspicious” video footage of the events, the medical committee writes.    And at the Sochi 2014 Paralympic Games, 37 percent of all sit-ski alpine athletes sustained injuries, nearly 5 percent of them to the head and neck.    In all sports, concussions often don’t get reported or even recognized because of the lack of knowledge of their effect on the athlete and because athletes tend to mask symptoms to keep from being kept out of competitions, the authors note.    This summer, the medical committee will be meeting with international sports federations to highlight these issues, but outside experts need to get involved, too, to help figure out the challenges of assessing these athletes and to develop strategies to prevent concussions.   Para sports were developed to level the playing field for impaired athletes. Now’s the time, the committee argues, to give concussion diagnosis, treatment and prevention equal time for these athletes.    “Education is the first point in protection, and we need to improve this for both para athletes and the medical staff who may treat them,” Webborn said.

2sRGRUn,2017-07-13,Nursing while pregnant safe for most healthy mothers," (Reuters Health) - Healthy, well-nourished women who breastfeed while pregnant don’t seem to increase their risk of delivering prematurely, miscarrying, or having a low-birth-weight baby, the authors of a new research review conclude.   But Gemma Lopez-Fernandez of Corporacio Sanitaria Parc Tauli in Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues write in the journal Women and Birth that more research is needed on the implications of nursing during pregnancy for mothers and children’s health.    While many women will decide to wean after getting pregnant, it is not uncommon for women to continue to nurse, Melissa Kotlen, an international board-certified lactation consultant based in New York, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.   “If you’re healthy, you’re low risk, you’re not on bedrest, there’s really no problem with continuing to nurse while you’re pregnant,” Kotlen said. “Most of these moms end up tandem nursing once the baby’s born anyway.”    But even pediatricians and obstetricians can fall prey to unproven but common beliefs about nursing during pregnancy, Kotlen added, for example that nipple stimulation will trigger the release of oxytocin and bring on labor prematurely, or that nursing during pregnancy will deplete a mother’s nutritional stores.    To investigate these and other potential risks of breastfeeding in pregnancy, Lopez-Fernandez and her team reviewed 19 studies published between 1990 and 2015 and including a total of about 6,300 women.    They found some evidence that women who nursed during pregnancy gained less weight, had fewer fat reserves and lower levels of hemoglobin – the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen. But the reviewers note that most research on the issue was done in the developing world.   The investigators found no support for the idea that breastfeeding women were more likely to deliver prematurely or to miscarry. Evidence on the effects of nursing during pregnancy on fetal and infant growth, as well as on the growth of the nursing child, was mixed.    Mothers who become pregnant while nursing should not be overly concerned about their nutritional status, as long as they are eating and drinking well, Kotlen said. “Your body knows exactly what it needs to take in. If you’re pregnant and you’re nursing, your body is going to know very quickly you need to eat a little bit more and you need to drink a little more.”   Lopez-Fernandez was not available for an interview by press time.

2tIwJju,2017-07-13,Mother’s soda intake during pregnancy tied to child’s obesity risk," Pregnant women who drink non-diet sodas during pregnancy are more likely to have kids who carry extra body fat by age 7, researchers say.   In the study of more than 1,000 mother-child pairs, each additional serving of sugary soda per day consumed in pregnancy was associated with higher increments of waist size and body mass in kids years later.   “Sugary beverages have been linked to obesity in children and adults,” said study author Sheryl Rifas-Shiman of Harvard Medical School in Boston.   Although past research has tied sodas and some fruit drinks to excess weight gain, obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, few have looked at beverage intake during pregnancy, she and her colleagues write in Pediatrics.   “Childhood obesity is widespread and hard to treat,” Rifas-Shiman told Reuters Health by email. “So it’s important to identify modifiable factors that occur prenatally and during infancy so prevention can start early.”   The researchers recruited 1,078 women from among patients at eight obstetric offices affiliated with Atrius Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates in eastern Massachusetts.    The study team had in-person meetings with each woman at the end of her first and second trimesters, as well as during the first few months after her baby was born. In addition, kids were assessed in early childhood, around age 3, and in mid-childhood, around age 8. Mothers also completed mailed questionnaires every year for the child’s first six birthdays.   At all visits, researchers collected information about both parents and details of the household. During pregnancy, women answered questionnaires about what they typically ate and drank, including how much regular and sugar-free soda, fruit juice, fruit drinks and water they consumed each day.    At the mid-childhood visit, when kids were between ages 6 and 11 years, the research team measured each child’s height, weight, waist circumference and skinfold thickness. With these measurements, they calculated body fat percentage and body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height.   When researchers looked at data gathered during pregnancy, they found that more than half of mothers had consumed more than half a serving a day of non-diet soda during pregnancy, and nearly 10 percent had consumed two or more servings a day.   Mothers who drank more sugary drinks during pregnancy tended to be younger, had higher prepregnancy BMI, lower education, lower income, shorter breastfeeding times and were more likely to have smoked during pregnancy.   About one quarter of the children were overweight or obese by mid-childhood, and BMI, waist circumference and skinfold thickness were highest among kids whose mothers drank at least two servings of sugary drinks per day.    Only regular sodas were associated with this difference. Juice, diet soda and water consumed during pregnancy weren’t linked to a higher BMI score in kids. The research team also didn’t see differences based on the mother’s weight, race or ethnicity, the child’s gender or the amount of soda children themselves drank.   “I was surprised that maternal intake seemed to be more important than child intake,” Rifas-Shiman noted.   In the future, she and colleagues plan to study the long-term effects of efforts to reduce sugary beverage intake during pregnancy. They’re now using new methods to analyze when children’s intake of sugary beverages matters the most for their weight and health.   “I was struck that the differences in children’s body composition were seen in relation to intake levels that appear unremarkable, even less than one serving per day,” said Sian Robinson of the University of Southampton in the UK, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “We need to know more about the long-term effects of maternal nutrition on offspring health,” she told Reuters Health by email. “Few intervention studies in pregnancy have longer-term follow-up data to describe the effects on children’s body composition.”   Several of these intervention studies have been completed recently, Robinson added, and that follow-up data will be available soon.   “The links between sugar-sweetened beverages and obesity are well-established,” she said. “But this new data suggests mothers’ consumption is important and has public health relevance.”  "
2ujY11e,2017-07-13,Many hold mistaken beliefs about reducing risks of cigarette smoking," Mistaken beliefs about behaviors that could reduce the risks of cigarette smoking are most common among those most vulnerable to the harmful effects of smoking, U.S. researchers say.   “It is important for the public to understand that the harms of smoking cannot be reduced except by quitting,” Annette R. Kaufman from the National Cancer Institute’s Tobacco Control Research Branch in Rockville, Maryland, told Reuters Health by email. “Certain behaviors, such as exercise and diet, do not reduce the harmful effects of smoking if a person continues to smoke.”    The tobacco industry has propagated a variety of mistaken beliefs that certain behaviors, like exercise or diet, and certain product features, like filters or menthol cigarettes, can reduce the risks associated with cigarette smoking, the study team writes in Preventive Medicine.    The researchers used information from the Health Information National Trends Survey to find out what people believe about risk-reducing behaviors and whether these beliefs differ between people who smoke, or have smoked in the past and those who have not. They also looked at whether income levels, education levels and race influenced those beliefs.    More than 80 percent of people correctly believed that quitting cigarette smoking can help reduce the harmful effects of smoking “a lot.” Less than 2 percent of people didn’t think quitting smoking would help “not at all.”   Former smokers were more likely than current smokers or never smokers to believe that quitting would offer a benefit, and people with a college degree were more likely than those with less education to believe it. Low-income individuals were less likely to believe that quitting smoking would reduce its harmful effects, researchers found.   More than half the people surveyed mistakenly believed that exercise reduces the harmful effects of smoking at least somewhat, and nearly half incorrectly believed that eating fruits and vegetables or taking vitamins could undo the harmful effects of smoking.    Younger adults were more likely to believe that exercise reduces the harm of cigarette smoking, and people in the lowest income category (less than $15,000 a year) were most likely to believe in the beneficial effects of vitamins.    People who classified themselves as Hispanic or “other” were more likely than whites to believe in exercise and vitamins as risk-reducing measures, and African Americans, Hispanics, and others were more likely to believe that fruit and vegetable consumption could lower their risk.    “Smoking risk-reducing beliefs are particularly prevalent among populations who may be more likely to smoke cigarettes including younger adults, those with lower income, and racial/ethnic minorities,” Kaufman said. “So, public health campaigns that emphasize the importance of quitting smoking and free resources for cessation, above and beyond engaging in any other healthy behaviors, would be valuable.    “The single most important behavior change a person who smokes can make to reduce the health risks of cigarette smoking is to quit completely, as early in life as possible,” she said.    “There are many free resources to help smokers quit, including Smokefree.gov, 1-877-44U-QUIT, 1-800-QUIT-NOW,” Kaufman added.

2ueaqTj,2017-07-12,"Toxic bacteria often lurk in children’s, dogs’ sandboxes"," (Reuters Health) - Playground sandboxes can harbor deadly - and drug resistant - strains of the diarrhea-causing bacterium Clostridum difficile, research in Spain shows.   Often called “C. diff” for short, the bug has typically been considered a problem for very ill hospitalized patients, but it’s increasingly being found outside hospitals, Dr. Jose Blanco of the faculty of Veterinary Medicine at Universidad Complutense de Madrid and colleagues write in the journal Zoonoses and Public Health.   Just as squeamish parents might expect, past studies have confirmed that public sandboxes can host disease-causing organisms, including parasites and bacteria. In the new study, Blanco’s team tested sand from 20 sandboxes for children and 20 for dogs in Madrid parks.   Twenty-one of the sandboxes tested positive for C. diff. Of these, eight of the samples were toxin-forming strains, the type that causes disease in humans, while the remaining twelve were non-toxigenic.     The findings are not cause for alarm, Blanco told Reuters Health in an email interview. He noted that C. difficile does not sicken children younger than 2 years old. “We have to learn to live with these agents. If our children live in a highly clean environment, their immune system will not be developed in the correct way, and probably, problems like allergy will be present,” he added.    “It is important do not leave organic material in the sandboxes, that could serve as food to different kinds of animals in the night. And also clean the sandboxes of possible animal fecal material (mainly in the morning, before the use by children).”   It’s not surprising to find C. difficile in sandboxes, Philip Tierno Jr., a professor of pathology and microbiology at NYU School of Medicine in New York City, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. Even though the study was done in Spain, he added, “it’s really something that could have been done here because C. difficile is ubiquitous.” Many people, including children, carry the bug without being sick, Tierno said, and it can now even be found in the food supply.   The best defense against C. difficile is careful handwashing, before eating and drinking and before touching one’s face, according to Tierno. While soap and water are effective against the germ, he said, alcohol-based sanitizing gels will not kill the bug.   Private sandboxes are likely to be relatively clean, but they should be covered when not in use to avoid bacteria and parasites carried by animals like rats and raccoons, Tierno said.    He noted that when he takes his grandchildren to the park, he steers clear of sandboxes. “I don’t see the need,” he said. “I’d rather take my kid to the beach and play with the sand there.”  "
2u0BIwI,2017-07-12,"Long-term, surgery for localized prostate cancer offers little extra benefit"," (Reuters Health) - A large new study that has followed prostate cancer patients for up to two decades concludes that surgery is probably not the best option for most men with localized tumors.   Men who had the surgery were only slightly more likely to live longer, but they were definitely more likely to be forced to live with the side effects of surgery such as urinary incontinence and erectile or sexual dysfunction.   For every 100 men diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer who underwent surgery, only four fewer died from the disease compared with those who were just kept under observation and treated for symptoms.    For every 100 men with low-risk disease who had a radical prostatectomy, no more than one was saved by surgery, a statistically insignificant difference, the researchers report in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Yet 30 to 40 men out of 100 who had surgery experienced erectile dysfunction within five years, 30 developed problems holding their urine within 10 years and 20 to 40 reported dissatisfaction with their ability to perform sexually.   The study, known as PIVOT, was designed to shed light on the ongoing controversy over how best to treat prostate cancer, a tumor that is diagnosed in 161,000 men in the U.S. each year but often fails to kill them because the cancer grows so slowly they are more likely to die from some other cause. Thus, many doctors simply recommend some form of watchful waiting.    The cancer kills about 27,000 annually, according to the American Cancer Society.   Because men today are being diagnosed earlier, with smaller tumors than they were 20 years ago, any benefits of surgery are probably even smaller than the study suggests, lead author Dr. Timothy Wilt said in written comments to Reuters Health.   By the same token, “Men currently diagnosed with prostate cancer will have even better long-term overall and prostate cancer survival with observation than men enrolled in PIVOT,” Wilt said.    The findings “reassure men with low-risk disease who have a life expectancy greater than 10 years that active surveillance is safe and offers better overall quality of life compared to radical treatment,” said Dr. Behfar Ehdaie of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who was not part of the study.   Some men with an intermediate risk may also be able to avoid surgery as well, he told Reuters Health in an email.   But Dr. Alexander Kutikov, chief of urologic oncology at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who also was not connected with the research, said the “quite controversial” study of 731 men, most treated at Veterans Affairs hospitals, was too small to be definitive and 20 percent of the men didn’t stick with their assigned treatment, muddying the results.   The study also falls short because the men were selected because they were thought to have a life expectancy of 10 years, Kutikov added. Yet at the 10-year mark nearly half had died. “Prostate cancer treatment is an investment at least 10 years into the future,” he said by email. “Men with limited life-expectancy only risk side effects of treatment and don’t live long enough to reap its benefits.”   “A potential harm of observation is that prostate cancer may spread if left untreated and could result in prostate cancer death,” Wilt acknowledged. “Fortunately for most men, this is very unlikely (about 10 percent of men after 20 years) and was not different in men treated with observation or surgery. Systemic progression and prostate cancer death are rare (about 5 percent) in men with low risk disease and are not decreased by surgery.”   Only men at intermediate risk showed a benefit from surgery; where survival was 14.5 percentage points higher. That translated to a 20 percent reduction in death from all causes.   With 731 men followed for a median of 12.7 years, PIVOT is one of the longest and largest cancer studies ever conducted.   In the surgery group, 61.4 percent of the men died from all causes and just 7.4 percent in the surgery group died from prostate cancer. In the observation group, 66.8 percent died, 11.4 percent from prostate cancer.  "
2sNbgD7,2017-07-11,Over one third of U.S. adults have advanced medical directives," (Reuters Health) - Nearly 37 percent of Americans have advanced directives for end-of-life care if they become seriously ill or unable to make health care decisions, according to a new analysis of recent research.   Roughly half of people with living wills or other types of advanced medical directives were not suffering from a chronic illness, the researchers note.     “Improving end-of-life care has been a national conversation for some time now, presumably because it will affect all of us at some point and is a very personal matter,” said senior study author Dr. Katherine Courtright of the Fostering Improvement in End-of-Life Decision Science Program at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.    The conversation has revived since Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people over age 65, began reimbursing physicians for advance-care planning counseling on January 1, 2016.   “This is a comprehensive national snapshot of the most widely promoted tool for end-of-life care planning and suggests that there is plenty of room to increase its reach,” she told Reuters Health by email.   Courtright’s team analyzed 150 studies published between 2000 and 2015 that reported on advanced directive completion in the United States. The studies included both healthy and sick patients, some focused on specific diseases or different types of advanced directives or particular populations. In total, they covered nearly 796,000 adults, of whom 64 percent were women, 65 percent were white, 81 percent were age 65 and older and 63 percent were in a nursing home.   The research team found that 36.7 percent of adults completed an advanced directive of some kind: 29 percent had living wills, 33 percent had health care powers of attorney and 32 percent had undefined advanced directives.    Older patients and those in hospice or palliative care were more likely to have an advanced directive, and end-of-life care documents were more common among those with neurologic disease such as dementia and least common among those with HIV/AIDS, according to the results published in Health Affairs.     But overall, 38.2 percent of people with a chronic illness had advanced directives compared to 32.7 percent of healthy people, a difference that wasn’t statistically meaningful.    “It was somewhat surprising how much the completion rate varied based on age, patient location and diagnosis, yet even among those with the highest completion rates, nearly half still hadn’t completed them,” Courtright said.   “The fact that only a third of sick patients are expressing their end-of-life wishes means we’re in trouble,” said Dr. Melissa Wachterman of Harvard Medical School in Boston, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Everybody should have this conversation because our values and preferences change over time,” she told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “A healthy 72-year-old may say she wants a breathing tube, but that choice may change.”   One limitation of the study is that it doesn’t include many population groups that may not document their end-of-life care wishes formally or trust medical or legal forms that dictate advanced directives, the authors note.   “As I like to say, the form is only as good as the conversation and the shared understanding that goes along with it,” said Dr. Rebecca Sudore of the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Some people do fill out these forms with families or lawyers, and then the forms sit in the dusty recesses of a back drawer and they are not available or shared with family and friends, especially before they are needed,” she told Reuters Health by email.   Advanced care planning advocates and researchers are looking for ways to reduce the barriers to completing directives by removing legal jargon, changing the reading level and revising the medical terms used.    Sudore recommends PrepareForYourCare.org for easy-to-read directives. Other organizations, such as Aging with Dignity ( bit.ly/2v9EjBq ), promote family conversations by starting with “Five Wishes” they want for the end of life.    “At the end of the day, I’ve heard from too many families that they couldn’t agree on what to do for mom or dad, and it’s often not on your radar until it’s too late,” said Paul Malley, president of Aging with Dignity in Tallahassee, Florida, in a phone interview.

2v8zqbW,2017-07-11,More evidence that outdoor time may help prevent nearsightedness," (Reuters Health) - Kids who spend more time outdoors and who play sports are less likely to be near-sighted, according to a recent study in a large, diverse group of urban 6-year-olds.   “Lifestyle in early youth is very much associated with onset of myopia,” Dr. Caroline Klaver of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam told Reuters Health in an email interview. “Not being outside, and performing lots of near work will increase risk a lot.”    While factors like being highly educated and of non-European heritage have traditionally been linked to nearsightedness, the new study suggests that how young children spend their time is likely to be the underlying source of these differences, the study team writes in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.   The researchers looked at 5,711 children in Rotterdam who have been participating since birth, along with their mothers, in a long-term study. At age 6, the children had a full medical examination and 2.4 percent were found to have myopia, or nearsightedness.   The researchers used statistical techniques to analyze a wide variety of factors, including social and economic aspects of the household, ethnicity, lifestyle, parents’ education levels, children’s’ activities and any links between these and the likelihood a child would be nearsighted.   The study team found that myopic children spent less time outdoors, had lower levels of vitamin D, had a higher body mass index and were less likely to play sports than children who weren’t nearsighted. While being of non-European descent, having a mother with a low education level and low family income were also associated with myopia, the researchers found that lifestyle factors explained most of these risks.   The study was limited by the low number of children with myopia and the lack of information about parents’ nearsightedness - “a well-known myopia risk factor,” the authors note.    “Differences in myopia prevalence between ethnic groups that have commonly been assumed to be down to genetics may in fact be due to differences in lifestyle between ethnic groups,” Dr. Jeremy Guggenheim, an optometry professor at Cardiff University in the UK, told Reuters Health in an email.    “The new study and other recent work suggests that this preventative effect of time outdoors is beneficial even at very young ages, e.g. 3 - 6 years-old,” said Guggenheim, who studies the causes of myopia and sometimes collaborates with Klaver’s team, but was not involved in the current study.    “Too much close work, such as reading and using hand-held devices, may also be a risk - although the jury is still out on this question,” he added.   To help prevent myopia, Klaver said, parents should have children play outside for 15 hours a week, and limit “near work” to no longer than 45 continuous minutes.   “It’s important to keep in mind that this type of study can never pin-point the precise causes of myopia in the way that is possible using purpose-designed clinical trials,” Guggenheim said. “Nevertheless, the risk factors that were identified in the new study fit neatly with what has been learned in recent years from such trials.”   “Basically this study adds very nicely to the evidence that we already see from many other studies and many other countries that there is definitely a connection between outdoor activity and myopia in children,” said Susan Vitale at the U.S. National Eye Institute.   “The main thing to remember is that if parents have any concerns about their child’s vision it’s very important that they get a dilated eye exam from a health care professional,” Vitale said. Regular eye care is the most important thing people can do to maintain their eye health, she added.  "
2tGPx15,2017-07-10,&#039;Brain training&#039; program doesn&#039;t improve self control," (Reuters Health) - Brain training programs may make people better at using brain training programs, but they don’t improve decision-making skills in real-world tasks like making healthy choices, a new study concludes.   Young adults recruited to use a commercial brain-training program for 10 weeks got better at that program’s specific tasks, but on a standard test of so-called executive function - the brain’s ability to regulate itself - they improved just as much as peers who had played video games for 10 weeks.   People should be skeptical about what benefits they can gain from brain training programs, said senior author Caryn Lerman, of the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia.   “They may need to manage those expectations a little better,” she told Reuters Health.   “Our laboratory at Penn has been focused for many years on understanding why it is so hard for people to change habits and behaviors that they know may increase their risk for certain diseases,” Lerman said.   The lab’s research suggests there are certain factors that make it easier for some people to quit smoking than for others, for example. The new study aimed to examine whether brain training could modify factors like executive function to change how people react in certain situations and ultimately make healthier choices.   The researchers recruited 128 participants between 18 and 35 years old who were split into two groups. While one group spent 10 weeks using the brain-training program Lumosity five days a week for 30 minutes each day, the comparison group spent the same amount of time playing online video games chosen specifically not to target executive function or to increase the level of challenge players faced.   Before the study started and after 10 weeks of online training or gaming, all participants underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan to measure brain activity while they performed assorted decision-making tasks.    The tasks tested whether the individual would choose smaller immediate rewards or larger rewards later, and smaller rewards that are guaranteed versus larger, less certain rewards.   The participants’ overall cognitive activity was also measured with tests examining attention, memory and other abilities.    After 10 weeks, there were no differences seen in the brain activity scans between the brain-training and video-game groups, the researchers report in the Journal of Neuroscience.   Both groups also experienced similar improvements on the standard cognitive and decision-making tests over the course of the study.   In a statement to Reuters Health, a spokesperson for Lumosity said the research’s scope was narrow.   “There remain many open questions in the field - how, why, and in what circumstances cognitive training is efficacious - and so painting in such broad strokes potentially undermines this important, ongoing research area,” wrote Sara Colvin in an email. “We remain committed to supporting quality research, regardless of the outcome: every study can be built on, and they all move us closer to answering open questions - in turn, improving the quality of products available.”   Colvin also said the company provides researchers - including those who conducted the new study - access to Lumosity and some data through its research network known as the Human Cognition Project.   Lerman also cautioned that the new study can’t say whether brain training would lead to differences for older people since her team focused on young adults.   “If it was effective we’d expect to see it in younger participants as well,” she noted.

2suafj5,2017-07-10,Placement and speed affect step monitor accuracy," Activity monitors can help in meeting health goals, but how they’re worn can significantly affect their accuracy and reliability, an Australian study suggests.    In a test of several consumer wearable activity monitors and one used by researchers and doctors, the accuracy of step counts was better when the device was worn at the waist versus the wrist, but also varied widely depending on walking or running speed.   “Current world health recommendations are for people to complete 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week to assist with improving overall health outcomes,” senior study author Belinda Parmenter told Reuters Health by email.   “Studies have indicated that a reference goal of 10,000 steps per day can also provide an appropriate level of activity to meet the minimum recommendations,” said Parmenter, an exercise physiologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.   She and her colleagues recruited 31 adults to complete three minutes on a treadmill at five different speeds ranging from about 3 miles per hour to about 7.5 miles per hour. The researchers videotaped each session to manually count steps for comparison to the monitors.   Each participant wore an Actigraph monitor - often used by researchers and clinicians for sleep or activity monitoring - on the waist and another Actigraph on the wrist. They also wore a Fitbit One on the waist, and on both wrists, a Fitbit Flex, Fitbit Charge HR and Jawbone UP24.   When the study team examined step counts for all the devices, they found errors ranging from about 41 percent for the wrist-worn Actigraph and less than 1 percent for both the waist-worn Fitbit One and Actigraph, according to the report in Gait and Posture.    For instance, in three-minute bouts at speeds ranging from 5 kilometers per hour to 12 kph, the Actigraph monitor worn at the waist had average step counts less than 1 percent more or less than the manual count by the researchers. But worn on the wrist, the Actigraph was off by an average 29 percent at slow speeds to 50 percent at the highest speed.   Fitbit One worn at the waist was always less than 2 percent off the manual count, while wrist-worn monitors ranged from less than 1 percent to about 12 percent difference, depending on speed.    “The Fitbit One worn around the waist performed the most accurate across all speeds when compared to all the devices worn around the wrist (Jawbone, Fitbit Charge, Fitbit Flex, Actigraph),” Parmenter said.   “During walking and running, the body’s center of mass is located at the pelvis. Movement of the center of mass provides the best indication of whole body movement.”   Since waist-worn devices are close to the pelvis, they can provide more accurate measurements of the body’s movement than wrist-worn devices, she added.   But among the wrist-worn devices, the Jawbone was the most accurate, performing well at both the slower walking speeds of the average adult, as well as the running speeds, Parmenter said.   “Other wrist-worn devices became more accurate as walking/running speed increased. For researchers, the Actigraph wGT3XBT worn on the waist matched the Fitbit One.”    People using step counts to meet the physical activity recommendations of 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise (or 30 minutes five times a week) can do so by completing at least 3,000 steps in 30 minutes, she added.   “These studies have shown that this equates to an intensity high enough to meet the current physical activity recommendations. So, for healthy individuals, as one way to meet the recommendations, we could be aiming to complete 3,000 steps in 30 minutes at least 5 times a week, as a part of our 10,000 steps a day goal,” Parmenter said.   The study also found that for the wrist-worn devices, there was no difference between the step counts measured on the dominant and non-dominant hand, Parmenter noted.   “However, the results are based purely on a treadmill test and did not include the effects of activities of daily living such as brushing teeth etc. More studies need to be done in a free-living environment,” she said.

2qKFVDY,2017-07-07,Kidney transplant rules may curb disparities," (Reuters Health) - A shift in how donor kidneys are allocated in the U.S. has been linked with higher transplant rates for black and Hispanic patients, a recent study suggests.    Kidney transplant is the preferred treatment for patients with end stage renal disease because it helps them live longer with a better quality of life and fewer hospitalizations than dialysis, the alternative. The primary factor the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) uses for allocating kidneys from deceased donors is how long patients have been waiting for organs.   Under the old UNOS system, waiting times were largely based on when people joined the waiting list for a kidney. In part to address long-standing racial and ethnic disparities in the old system, in 2014 UNOS started calculating wait times based either on when people joined the waiting list or when they began dialysis, whichever came first.    For the study, researchers examined data on 179,071 people on the kidney transplant waiting list from June 2013 to September 2016, including the 34,133 individuals who received organs.   White patients had a significantly higher kidney transplant rate than black or Hispanic patients under the old system, but with the new system the differences narrowed to the point where they might have been due to chance.    For some patients, it can take months or even years to get on the waiting list, due to significant delays and differences in how long doctors might wait to send patients for evaluation at transplant centers, said senior study author Dr. Rachel Patzer of Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.   “The new system tends to even the playing field by starting the clock at the start of the disease process,” Patzer told Reuters Health.    “For those that get a transplant sooner, their post-transplant survival is much better the less time spent on dialysis prior to transplant,” Patzer said by email.    The monthly transplant rate under the old UNOS system was 1.07 percent for white patients, compared with 0.80 percent for black people and 0.79 for Hispanics.    With the new system, however, the monthly transplant rate dropped to 0.95 percent for white people. At the same time, it rose to 0.96 percent for black people and 0.91 percent for Hispanic patients, researchers report in Health Affairs.    One limitation of the study is the relatively short duration of follow-up time after the new UNOS system took effect, the authors note. They also lacked data that might show how individual patient characteristics influenced who received a kidney or how long they waited.    Under the old system, for example, white patients might have had an advantage because they were more likely to have private health insurance, access to education about transplants or a car to get to the transplant center, said Amy Waterman, deputy director, Transplant Research and Education Center at the Terasaki Research Institute affiliated with the University of California Los Angeles.    “Since the clock started for waiting time when patients were listed at the transplant center officially, those who went forward for transplant evaluation faster, the white patients, benefited since they could begin accruing waiting time and move up the waiting list for a matching kidney,” Waterman, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   The longer patients remain on dialysis, the more likely they are to die or develop other illnesses or complications of end stage renal disease that decrease their ability to have a transplant, said Dr. Clive Callender, a researcher at Howard University College of Medicine and founder and president of the National Minority Organ Tissue Transplant Education Program (MOTTEP) who wasn’t involved in the study.   “The best advice is to get transplanted without dialysis and with a live donor,” Callender said by email.    “The fewer dialysis treatments you have, the better the chances you survive for a long period of time,” Callender said.   "
2sJlIhy,2017-07-07,Insurance pays little for caregiving of elderly at end of life," (Reuters Health) - Unpaid family and friends provide the overwhelming majority of care to the elderly in their last year of life, according to a new study highlighting the need to expand supportive services to caregivers.   In 2011, 2.3 million caregivers tended to the needs of an estimated 905,000 older Americans in their final year of life, the report in Health Affairs found.    Nearly 9 in 10 of the caregivers were unpaid, and only 9 percent of dying older adults received money for caregiving from government or private insurance.    “Supporting caregivers is an urgent public health issue,” said lead author Dr. Katherine Ornstein, a professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.   “We have a huge reliance on families throughout the course of serious illness, but especially at the end of life. It’s the most complex and challenging time, and it’s really the families who are involved,” she said in a phone interview.   Ornstein and her team used two previous national studies to estimate the number of people tending to the basic needs of Medicare beneficiaries who were 65 and older and in the last year of their lives. Only 14 percent of the caregivers were spouses, and nearly two-thirds of the spouses reported receiving no help from other relatives or friends.    Caregiving includes assistance with basic activities, such as eating and bathing.    The spouses reported caring for their husbands and wives for an average of 10 years and an average of 44 hours a week and were more than twice as likely as other end-of-life caregivers to feel depressed.   The children of dying elders, especially the daughters, carried the biggest burden, the study showed. Daughters provided more than 38 percent of caregiving to their parents, while sons provided 22 percent.   “We’ve known that families are involved,” Ornstein said. “But here’s proof. They’re especially involved at the end of life. What can we do to make it easier so they can do their jobs?”   “We have to think more about policies that will support caregivers at the end of life,” she said.   The researchers identified 2,423 community-dwelling older adults receiving help in 2011. Based on the fact that 264 of them died within the year, the researchers estimated that 905,000 elderly community-dwelling older adults received help from an estimated 2 million unpaid caregivers in their final year.   “This article is a call for attention for the important role of caregivers in caring for an aging population and for Congress to start thinking about how to restructure Medicare for an aging society in which people are having multiple chronic illnesses and need assistance with daily living at the close of life,” said Dr. Joan Teno, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle. She was not involved with the new study.   “We have a healthcare system that’s built around the needs of the healthcare system and not the needs of the family,” she said in a phone interview. “We have an aging society, and we have little time to deal with the silver tsunami we’re not ready for.”   Medicare was designed in the 1960s for a different population, Teno said. Today’s older adults more frequently face death at home after being sent home from hospitals sicker and with more complicated needs, she said.   Many of the caregivers are members of the so-called sandwich generation, children of the elderly who are at the same time still caring for their own children, Teno said.    Ornstein was surprised to see that end-of-life caregivers were not more depressed, anxious or stressed about money than caregivers ministering to people with longer than a year to live, she said.   “It really speaks to the fact that the challenging job of a caregiver is not necessarily restricted to a few months before one dies,” she said. “Certainly individuals are more vulnerable at the end of life. Support for caregivers may be more urgent at the end of life but important through critical illness.”  "
2s3pcsr,2017-07-07,Surgeon moms face special challenges," (Reuters Health) - Dr. Jennifer Davids went straight from high school to college to medical school and into training to become a colorectal surgeon. Even without a break, she wasn’t finished with her studies until she was 34 years old – at the beginning of the end of most women’s reproductive years.   She gave birth to her first child during her surgical training and her second at the start of her practice, challenging times in both cases, and wondered when the optimal time might be for doctors, particularly those in the most demanding medical specialties, to become mothers.   So Davids, a professor at the University of Massachusetts in Worcester, conducted a survey. The responses she got from physician moms showed that there might not be an ideal time for a woman doctor to have a child.   “We didn’t find a great window where everything would seamlessly fall into place,” Davids said in a phone interview. “There is no perfect time.”   But her study did find that physician mothers seemed happier with their careers when they picked specialties requiring fewer years of training and allowing more flexible schedules.    Surgeons, anesthesiologists, gastroenterologists and obstetricians were more likely to wish they’d chosen less demanding specialties than physician mothers in primary care and other generally less demanding specialties, according to the report in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons.    Davids and her colleagues recruited 738 physician mothers who had children during their post-graduate clinical medical training through Facebook’s Physician Moms Group in the spring of 2015. They compared the mothers in surgery and other so-called “procedural” specialties, who made up 30 percent of respondents, to other physician mothers who spent less time training for their specialties.    Participants were nearly all married and lived in almost every state in the U.S., the study found.   Women in procedural fields were more likely to use assisted reproduction to become pregnant and to take shorter maternity leaves. Procedural trainees were also more likely to have to make arrangements for their own substitutes when they missed work, as opposed to having their chief residents or department chairs find substitutes.    The physicians in procedural fields were less likely to have chosen their field based on considerations around pregnancy and childcare, and they were nearly twice as likely to report they wished they were in a less demanding specialty.    The findings point to a need for possible changes in training for procedural specialties, said Davids and her co-author, Dr. Nelya Melnitchouk, a colorectal surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.    More flexibility and competency-based training models, as opposed to those that require trainees to perform a certain number of procedures, might ease the difficulties procedural trainees encountered in becoming mothers, Melnitchouk said in an email.   “There are some unique challenges of women in procedural specialties,” Davids said. “There needs to be flexibility and support so we can be there for our patients while also being there for our families.”   Dr. Shanda Blackmon, a cardiothoracic surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, believes inappropriate expectations can lead to career dissatisfaction. Blackmon, who was not involved in the new study, stressed the need for a circle of support.   “If you survey who has a husband that stays at home and supports the family,” she said in an email, “the results may be different.”   “Those without a village of support will get out of the specialty to save their families,” she said.   In-hospital childcare and childcare that begins as early as 4 a.m., when trainees are expected to report to the hospital, might help, Blackmon said.   Women comprised just 7 percent of U.S. medical school graduates in 1965, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Today that rate hovers near 50 percent. A majority of surgical residents, however, continue to be male.   Previous studies have shown that women in surgical specialties are less satisfied with their careers than their male counterparts.   But Davids has no regrets.   “I certainly wouldn’t change my specialty or my job,” she said. “What I do is my passion. My advice to others would be, ‘make sure you’re proactive in seeking the support you need to accomplish your goals.’ “  "
2tMbazm,2017-07-07,Treatable menopause symptoms linked to depression in older women," Women over age 65 dealing with hot flashes and other treatable symptoms of low estrogen are more likely to also have moderate or severe depression, according to a large study in Australia.   Researchers found that women with depressive symptoms were also more likely to have money worries, caregiving responsibilities or chronic health conditions, suggesting there are many issues that could contribute to depression in this age group. Treatment for depression should therefore address the hormonal problems in this mix that are modifiable, the study team writes in Menopause.   “Other studies had already shown that when women were perimenopausal or early postmenopausal that there is an increased vulnerability to depressive symptoms,” senior study author Susan Davis told Reuters Health by email.   “We were interested in whether hot flushes were indicative of heightened vulnerability - and we found this to be the case,” said Davis, a researcher with the School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine at Monash University in Melbourne.   Davis and colleagues enrolled more than 1,500 mostly white women between the ages of 65 and 79 who were randomly selected from Australian voter rolls.    The women answered questionnaires that asked about life and financial circumstances, relationships, health problems and medication use. They also asked about post-menopausal symptoms including hot flashes, night sweats and pain during intercourse, as well as about depressive symptoms and recent use of anti-depressant medications.   One of every three women reported having hot flashes, which also increased their risk of depressive symptoms by 67 percent compared to women without hot flashes.    One in four women had used a psychotropic medication such as an antidepressant in the previous month.   Women with partners were about 40 percent less likely to have depression symptoms compared to women who were alone. Women who were employed had less than half the risk of depressive symptoms compared to women who were unemployed.    While hot flashes, vaginal dryness and pelvic floor dysfunction were each independently associated with depression risk, the study cannot prove that these or any other factors examined in the analysis cause depression.    Davis, however, said loss of estrogen could be a contributor. “Estrogen has major central effects in the brain and the sudden fall in estrogen at menopause can cause some women to become profoundly anxious (or depressed),” she said. “After childbirth the sudden drop in hormones can have the same effect.”   Older women with hot flashes, vaginal dryness or pelvic floor concerns should be evaluated for depression, “particularly if they have financial housing issues or significant caregiving responsibilities,” Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Reuters Health by email.    “Women going through the menopause are four times more likely to suffer from depression than women who are younger than 45,” said Pinkerton, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Charlottesville, Virginia, and executive director of the North American Menopause Society   Depression is not anxiety, bouts of sadness, low mood or mood swings but a mental disorder defined by the feeling of extreme sadness lasting for more than two weeks, often with no specific cause, and which interferes with everyday life, Pinkerton said.   As far as treatment, evidence doesn’t support hormone therapy as a first treatment of depression, although it is often used along with counseling or antidepressants, she noted.   “For more severe depression, antidepressant medications can be used to correct the chemical imbalance and some have been found to relieve hot flashes. If depression is severe, antidepressant medication is most effective when used in combination with counseling or psychotherapy,” she said.   For mild to moderate depression, herbal remedies such as St. John’s wort, cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle changes may be helpful, such as prioritizing tasks, exercising, engaging in activities, recognizing the effect of stress on your mood, she said.    Women with a history of perimenopause-related depression that improves on hormone therapy need to be monitored after hormone therapy is stopped, as their depressive symptoms may recur, Pinkerton added.  "
2tRlZQh,2017-07-07,Pet owners more likely to find ticks on themselves," Having a pet dog or cat more than doubles the odds that humans will find a tick on themselves, and that could raise the risk of contracting tick-borne diseases like Lyme, researchers say.   “Ticks can transmit disease to people and their pets, particularly in the warmer months when they are most active,” said lead study author Erin Jones of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in Baltimore.    Jones’ team analyzed data collected by a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiative called TickNET, which aims to prevent tick-borne diseases across the country. Lyme disease is the most common such disease in the U.S.; the risk of exposure is highest in northeastern states, the researchers write in Zoonoses and Public Health.   “Preventing tick bites by avoiding wooded and brushy areas with high grass and leaf litter, appropriately using repellents on skin and clothing, and checking for ticks after going outside are effective prevention methods,” Jones said in an email.   The researchers surveyed 2,727 households in three states where Lyme disease is endemic: Connecticut, Maryland and New York. More than half of the households, 1,526, had a dog, a cat or both. About 88 percent of these households reported using some form of tick control on their pets.   Overall, about 31 percent of pet owners had found a tick crawling on a human in the household and 19 percent of pet owners had found a tick attached to a human household member. By comparison, about 20 percent of non-pet owning households found a tick crawling on a human and 14 percent found a tick attached to a human.   About 20 percent of pet-owning households had found ticks on their pets. Finding a tick on a pet doubled the likelihood of finding ticks crawling on or attached to household members.    Owners still found ticks on their pets when they used tick control medication, the study authors note.    But the researchers found no significant difference in tick-borne diseases reported by pet owners and non-owners - in each group, about 20 percent had had a verified tick-borne illness.   Certain property characteristics, such as having a vegetable garden, compost pile, log pile, bird feeder, stone walls and children’s play equipment, were associated with higher odds of finding ticks crawling on, or attached to, human household members.    “Lyme disease is getting more attention because the number of human cases has increased, and tick habitats are changing as an indirect consequence of climate change,” said Dr. Bruno Chomel, a veterinary researcher at the University of California, Davis who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It makes sense that people who have pets, especially dogs, are more likely to be around fields or areas where ticks could be hanging out,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “Pets can bring these parasites into the human environment, especially if they sit on couches or sleep in beds with owners.”   One limitation of the study is that tick control use was self-reported, so the research team wasn’t sure whether the owners applied the medication accurately and consistently or what brand was used. In addition, the study group may have been too small to detect an increased risk of tick-borne diseases when a household included pets, the authors write.    “Pet owners are encouraged to check their pets for ticks daily, especially after they spend time outdoors,” Jones told Reuters Health. “Enjoy the outdoors, but prevent tick bites on yourselves and your pets.”  "
2sRBALw,2017-07-06,Narrow health insurance networks more likely to exclude top cancer docs," (Reuters Health) - People who want access to the best cancer treatment centers in the U.S. may want to avoid health insurance plans that only offer a narrow network of providers, suggests a new study.   Compared to health insurance plans with larger provider networks, plans with fewer providers to choose from were more likely to exclude cancer doctors at National Cancer Institute (NCI)-Designated Cancer Centers, researchers found.   “We think there should be more transparency about this when patients are signing up for these plans,” said lead author Laura Yasaitis, of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia.   Health insurance plans that offer a narrow network of providers are usually cheaper than plans with more doctors to choose from, Yasaitis and colleagues write in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.   To be able to offer lower premiums, insurance plans might exclude higher-cost doctors or hospitals. Also, some doctors and hospitals may refuse to accept the reimbursement terms offered by the lower-cost plans, thereby excluding themselves.   It’s not clear whether a narrow network affects the quality of care people receive, but the researchers say the limited selection may cut access to high-quality providers like those at NCI-Designated Cancer Centers.   A NCI-Designated Cancer Center earns the distinction through top quality care and research, Yasaitis told Reuters Health. Past research shows patients - especially those with the most complex cancer cases - do better at those centers.   To examine access to doctors at those top cancer centers, the researchers analyzed the plans offered in 2014 on the individual health insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. They looked at differences between geographic areas with and without at least one of the 69 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers, and they compared plans that did or didn’t pay for treatment by doctors at those centers.   Altogether, the researchers identified 23,442 oncologists. About three quarters participated in at least one network offered on the insurance exchanges.   The ratio of cancer doctors to patients was higher in the 51 insurance markets with at least one NCI-Designated Cancer Center, at roughly 14 oncologists per 100,000 people, compared to about 9 per 100,000 people in markets without a top cancer center.   But whereas in areas without an NCI-designated cancer center, nearly 50 percent of oncologists were available to narrow-network plan members, that was true for only about 39 percent of oncologists in areas that did have the highly-rated hospitals.        When the researchers analyzed the 248 insurance plans in markets with NCI centers, they found 33 didn’t include any of those institutions’ oncologists.   “The narrow-network-included physicians were less likely to be NCI affiliated,” said Yasaitis.   The pattern was similar when the researchers looked at markets with National Comprehensive Cancer Network Cancer Centers, which are known for treating complex and rare malignancies.   “The findings are clear and consistent,” said Dr. Justin Bekelman, a study co-author also at the Perelman School of Medicine.   Bekelman told Reuters Health that patients need to be aware of their insurance plan’s offerings.   “It looks like most of these centers known for the highest quality care are being cut out of these plans,” he said.   Bekelman said insurers can mark which insurance plans include NCI-affiliated oncologists.   Yasaitis also said insurance companies should allow people to ask for an exemption that allows them to seek needed treatments.   “They should be able to pursue it at that center without incurring a whole lot of additional charges,” she said.  "
2utX8Qz,2017-07-06,Sleep apnea linked to worsening diabetic eye disease," People with both sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes have more than double the risk of worsening retina disease compared to diabetics without the sleep breathing disorder, a UK study suggests.   Researchers followed adults with type 2 diabetes over about four years and found that for those with milder eye disease at the start, having sleep apnea was linked to higher odds that it would become more advanced.    At the outset of the study, they also found that advanced “sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy” was already present in 43 percent of people with sleep apnea, compared to just 24 percent of those without apnea.    “Patients with type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are at increased risk of developing advanced retinopathy and also are at increased risk of greater decline in kidney function, as we found in a previous publication,” senior study author Dr. Abd A. Tahrani from University of Birmingham told Reuters Health.   “Hence, diagnosing OSA offers the opportunity to identify a high-risk group of patients which will allow doctors to apply preventative treatment strategy to slow the progression of these complications,” Tahrani said by email.   Diabetic eye disease, or retinopathy, affects as many as 50 percent of people with diabetes, yet it remains unclear exactly what contributes to its development or what causes it to get worse.   Past studies have found a link between sleep apnea and damage to tiny blood vessels that causes kidney and nerve problems in people with diabetes, the authors note.   Tahrani’s team looked at whether sleep apnea is associated with the progression of diabetic retinopathy in 230 patients with type 2 diabetes, none of whom had diagnosed respiratory conditions, including sleep apnea, at the start of the study.    After sleep monitoring was done, 63 percent of the participants were found to have obstructive sleep apnea.   At the outset, the rates of sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy, advanced diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy (damage to the part of the eye responsible for central vision) were already higher in patients with sleep apnea than in those without sleep apnea.    As time went on, three times as many patients with sleep apnea, 18.4 percent, progressed to more advanced stages of diabetic retinopathy compared to 6.1 percent of those without sleep apnea, according to the report in American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.   The worse the sleep apnea, the faster the progression of diabetic retinopathy, researchers found.   Sleep apnea, however, did not appear to be associated with faster progression of existing sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy.    On a positive note, sleep apnea treatment with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) slowed the progression to advanced diabetic retinopathy.    “While the impact of CPAP on retinopathy and other diabetes-related complications requires further study, CPAP treatment has several benefits, including lowering the blood pressure, improving sleepiness, improving quality of life, improving OSA-related symptoms and reducing the risk of road traffic accidents; hence CPAP treatment should be considered in patients with type 2 diabetes who have OSA,” Tahrani said.   “Diabetic retinopathy is mostly caused by diabetes, and more severe diabetic retinopathy could be promoted by poor blood sugar control and OSA in type 2 diabetes,” said Dr. Gen-Min Lin from Hualien-Armed Forces General Hospital and National Dong Hwa University in Hualien, Taiwan, who recently looked at the association of sleep apnea with changes in the tiny blood vessels of the retina.   “In some cross-sectional studies, women with more severe OSA were found to have higher risk of less severe diabetic retinopathy (such as microaneurysms) than men,” Lin told Reuters Health in an email. “This sex difference might be related to female sex hormone or higher grade inflammation status in women.”   "
2sqKW1g,2017-07-05,Heartburn drugs tied to greater mortality," (Reuters Health) - Widely used heartburn drugs are associated with increased risk of death, and the longer a person uses the drugs, the greater the risk, new research suggests.   Proton pump inhibitors or PPIs, have been tied to a wide range of side effects including fractures, dementia, heart disease, pneumonia and kidney disease, the study’s senior author Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.    “We took it a bit further and asked is this class associated with a higher risk of death, and the answer is yes,” he said.   About 50 million people in the U.S. are on PPIs, Al-Aly noted, and there is strong evidence that the drugs are overused. Popular drugs in this class include omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium) and lansoprazole (Prevacid).   He and his colleagues looked at data on millions of U.S. military veterans to determine if taking PPIs was associated with an increased risk of dying during about six years of follow-up.   Their analysis included nearly 350,000 new users of PPIs or H2 blockers, another type of acid-suppressing drug. They also compared PPI users and non-users within a group of nearly 3.3 million people, and PPI versus no PPI and no H2 blockers among about 2.9 million people.   New users of PPIs were 25 percent more likely to die during follow-up than people who started taking H2 blockers, Al-Aly and his colleagues report in BMJ Open.    For new PPI users, death risk rose in tandem with the amount of time the person took the medication. Risk was also increased in people who were on PPIs without an appropriate medical reason.   The most likely explanation for the increased mortality risk is the side effects associated with PPIs, Al-Aly said. In terms of the mechanisms that could be involved, he added, laboratory experiments have shown that lysosomes - tiny organs within cells that act like garbage disposals to get rid of waste - don’t function well in people taking PPIs. Other research has shown that PPIs may shorten the protective chromosome ends known as telomeres, in effect speeding up cell aging.   When a person has heartburn or reflux, he added, possible root causes like obesity, poor diet or smoking should be addressed first. “Any intake or use of PPIs should be under the watchful and vigilant eye of a physician, for the smallest dose that’s effective and the shortest period of time,” he said.

2uKkpwR,2017-07-05,Can less invasive uterine fibroid treatment improve fertility?," (Reuters Health) - Women who are unable to conceive because of uterine fibroids may have an easier time getting pregnant after minimally invasive procedures to destroy the fibroids, a recent study suggests.    For the study, researchers followed 359 women for an average of almost six years after they had what’s known as uterine fibroid embolization, when doctors destroy fibroids by blocking the arteries supplying them with blood. By the end of the study, 149 of the women, or 42 percent, had become pregnant one or more times, and 131 women had a total of 150 live births.    “Uterine embolization procedure is a controversial matter because it is still seen as a risk to fertility,” said lead study author Dr. Joao Martins Pisco, a researcher at New University of Lisbon.    “With this study we were able to verify that women who could not conceive due to uterine fibroids, once subjected to embolization, could have a normal pregnancy with a live newborn,” Martins Pisco said by email.    Uterine fibroids, abnormal masses of fiber and muscle tissue in the wall of the uterus, are one of the most common causes of infertility and pregnancy complications, the study team writes in the journal Radiology. Previous research has found that one out of every four women with fibroids has problems related to fertility.    The standard treatment is myomectomy, a surgery that involves cutting through the skin on the lower abdomen to reach the uterus and removing fibroids from the uterine wall. This procedure isn’t always effective, and it can sometimes lead to complications that require a hysterectomy - surgical removal of all or part of the uterus.    While embolization is less invasive and can be done in women who have already had a myomectomy, some doctors have avoided this option out of a concern that it may restrict blood flow to the lining of the uterus and ovaries, making it harder for women to have babies, researchers note.    In the current study, conducted at a single medical center in Portugal, about 32 percent of the women had at least one previous pregnancy and 20 percent had a live birth at least once before.    Overall, 79 percent of the women had an improvement in fibroid-related symptoms, the study found. About 15 percent of women had complications with partial embolization, when only small vessels to the fibroids are blocked, and roughly 23 percent had problems with full embolization, when all uterine artery branches are blocked.    In 28 cases, women needed repeat embolization procedures because the fibroids weren’t fully treated.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that embolization is better than other fibroid treatments. Another limitation is that all of the embolization procedures were done at a single site, making it possible that results would be different at other hospitals or surgical centers, the authors note.    Even so, the results suggest that women may want to consider embolization for fibroids when they’re struggling to conceive, especially if they want to avoid the risk of hysterectomy with more invasive fibroid surgery, Martins Pisco said.    Fibroids won’t always get in the way of conception, however, and women should be sure to rule out other causes of infertility if they are only considering surgery to improve their chances of having a baby, said Dr. Mikulas Redecha, a researcher at the University Hospital Bratislava in Slovakia who wasn’t involved in the study.    Women should also avoid putting off pregnancy, Redecha added by email.    “With increasing age, the chances for spontaneous conception decrease and the chance of developing a fibroid increases,” Redecha said. “If you have a fibroid, that does not automatically mean that getting pregnant spontaneously is impossible.”  "
2u2zLwn,2017-07-05,Nasty parental divorce may leave a mark on adult immune system," (Reuters Health) - Children whose parents separate and are not on speaking terms may be more vulnerable to catching colds as adults than kids whose parents stay together or go through an amicable breakup, a recent study suggests.    “There is evidence that children whose parents divorce are at increased risk for illness both during their childhood and as adults,” said lead study author Michael Murphy, a psychology researcher at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.    “However, our study indicates that parental separation itself may not account for this increased risk,” Murphy said by email. “This is important because parental divorce is a common experience, affecting more than a million children annually in the United States alone.”   For the study, researchers quarantined 201 healthy adults, exposed them to a virus that causes a common cold and monitored them for five days to see how their immune systems reacted and if they developed a respiratory illness.    Adults whose parents lived apart and never spoke during their childhood were more than three times as likely to develop a cold as participants who grew up in two-parent households, the study found. However, adults whose parents separated but communicated with each other were no more likely to catch a cold than people who came from intact families.    People whose parents separated and stopped speaking were 3.3 times more likely to develop a cold than people whose parents remained together during their childhood, the study found. These people also had higher levels of a marker of inflammation, which might help explain why they were more susceptible to catching a cold, the researchers speculate.   Participants in the study were about 30 years old on average, and 92 of them, or 46 percent, reported that their parents had divorced or separated during their childhood. Among the people with separated parents, 51 said their parents weren’t on speaking terms.    All of them were given nasal drops containing rhinovirus 39 (RV39), a virus that causes the common cold.    Then, for the next five days, researchers collected nasal secretions to check for evidence of the virus and inflammation as well as to assess how much mucus people produced and how congested they were.    Overall, 149 participants, or 74 percent, developed an infection with RV39 and 60 people met the criteria for a cold based on having both an infection and objective symptoms, researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.    Limitations of the study include its reliance on participants to accurately recall and report on whether their parents communicated after a separation, the authors note. Even though researchers accounted for a number of factors that can influence the odds of catching a cold such as medical and psychiatric history and prescription use, it’s still possible something other than divorce or parents’ communication influenced the results.    “Although it’s natural to suggest there’s a causal process in play here from early parental divorce to later health, it’s just as likely that the children of adults who never spoke with each other after their separation share many of the same personality dispositions as their parents - perhaps hostility, addiction or depression - and it is these variables that actually place the young adults at greater risk for colds,” David Sbarra, a psychology researcher at the University of Arizona who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Even so, the findings add to growing evidence linking divorce-related stress to an increased risk of physical health problems, said Sharlene Wolchik, a psychology researcher at Arizona State University who also wasn’t involved in the study.    “The good news is that we know a fair amount about the protective factors that reduce this risk,” Wolchik said by email. “When divorce is followed by a new family structure in which parents have high quality relationships with their children, children spend sufficient time with each parent so their relationships can be meaningful and children are not directly or indirectly exposed to conflict between the parents, children can be resilient and thrive despite the stress of divorce.”  "
2slYQpL,2017-07-05,Effectiveness of fire-safe cigarette laws still unclear," (Reuters Health) - Laws requiring cigarettes to be made with a fire-retarding design may have reduced deaths from cigarette-related fires in the U.S. but the evidence is weak and inconsistent, researchers say.   The study found no evidence that so-called fire-safe cigarettes reduced the number of fires overall or fires started by cigarettes in the states where they were mandated, leaving the jury still out on whether these laws are a good way to protect people, the authors report in Injury Prevention.    “Smoking-related fires are one of the most common causes of death due to fires in the United States, and fire safe cigarettes are an interesting and innovative way to combat this problem,” lead author Dr. Carl Bonander told Reuters Health in an email.   “The enforcement of fire safety standards on cigarettes seems to be commonplace in many parts of the world today, but the evidence regarding the effects on fire mortality seemed quite ambiguous,” said Bonander, a researcher with the Department of Environmental and Life Sciences at Karlstad University in Sweden.   Bonander and colleagues used data from several sources to examine the implementation of fire-safe cigarette laws in the U.S. By 2012, all 50 states had some sort of fire safe cigarette laws in place.   “Generally, the laws mandate that cigarettes must pass a test where the cigarette is lit and placed on a filter paper substrate. Conventional cigarettes will usually burn their full length in this test, while fire safe (or more formally, reduced ignition propensity) cigarettes will self-extinguish before that,” Bonander said.   To comply with the fire safety standards, a brand must extinguish more than 75 percent of the time under repeated testing, said Bonander.   In real-world conditions, however, there is evidence that these fire-safe cigarettes can ignite sofas or mattresses just as easily as any other cigarette, the study team notes.   Still, the researchers found some evidence of a reduction in deaths from fires caused by cigarettes after the laws were enacted. But when they adjusted for other factors and trends that might influence the number of deaths, the effect of fire-safe cigarette laws “disappeared,” the authors write.    “We find that the evidence regarding the effects of fire safe cigarette laws on fire mortality and cigarette-related fires is rather weak, which could indicate that they are not working as intended. It is not entirely clear whether this is due to the construction of the cigarettes themselves, or due to other circumstances surrounding the legislation,” Bonander said.   Lorraine Carli, vice president of outreach and advocacy for the National Fire Protection Association in Quincy, Massachusetts, agrees that the study seems to conclude it is not possible to definitively state one way or another whether the fire-safe cigarettes are effective.     “Fire safe cigarettes are intended to reduce the likelihood of fires on upholstered furniture and bedding,” Carli told Reuters Health in an email. “Some studies indicate they are effective in these situations. There has been limited research so we will look to future studies to continue to chart impact.”    More evidence over time may yield more definitive results and some research has shown some positive results, said Carli, who was not involved in the study.   According to the National Fire Protection Association, 610 Americans died due to cigarette-related fires in 2010, which was an all-time low since 1980. However, the number of smokers has gone down since the eighties and fire resistance standards have also gotten stricter over the years, the organization notes on its website ( bit.ly/2sNoHSE ).  "
2tthiMN,2017-06-30,Cancer patients should check drug list with pharmacist," (Reuters Health) - Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy should have all their medications and herbal supplements reviewed by a pharmacist who specializes in cancer therapy, researchers say.   More than half the patients in a recent study reported taking prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs or herbal supplements along with chemotherapy, and roughly one in six patients were using products that put them at risk for potentially harmful drug interactions.    “Patients with cancer frequently use herbal supplements and other medications,” said lead study author Dr. Allan Ramos-Esquivel of the University of Costa Rica in San Jose.   “These patients are at high risk of herb-drug interactions and drug-drug interactions,” he told Reuters Health.   Ramos-Esquivel and colleagues surveyed 149 newly diagnosed cancer patients about prescription or over-the-counter drugs and herbal supplements they were taking as they started on new anti-cancer therapies.    Working with a clinical pharmacist, the researchers identified 36 potential interactions in 26 patients, or 17 percent. The researchers then notified the oncologist who prescribed the anti-cancer drugs, and in all cases, oncologists modified the patients’ therapy.    “The treatment of cancer has shifted in the past decade to the use of more oral agents,” said John Bossaer of East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. Bossaer, who wasn’t involved with this study, has researched drug interactions and anti-cancer drugs.    “Because these newer drugs are taken orally, many patients (and I fear some clinicians) perceive them as safer,” he told Reuters Health by email. “While these oral agents do not generally cause the life-threatening toxicities of IV chemotherapy, they cause many other side effects, which can be worsened by other medications.”   Herbal-drug interactions, in particular, are concerning because of unanswered questions and scientific gaps, Bossaer added. Herb-drug interactions go unnoticed because formal drug interaction studies don’t typically include them.    “Moreover, many patients do not openly disclose their use of herbal medications, either because of fear of judgment from their physician or assuming their use isn’t related to their treatment,” he said.   In this study, 84 patients, or 56 percent were using herbal supplements at the time of their first cancer drug prescription.   Using two or more medicinal products in addition to the anti-cancer therapy was associated with a two times higher risk of a drug interaction, the authors found.    “It is not as black and white as it may seem,” Bossaer said.    For example, he explained, the prostate cancer drug enzalutamide decreases the effectiveness of several medications, including ticagrelor, which is often used after stent placement for heart disease. A drug interaction may put the patient at greater risk for a heart attack, which isn’t typically noticed until the heart attack happens.   “This nuance requires both extensive drug and clinical disease-state knowledge,” Bossaer said. “This is exactly what clinical pharmacists are trained to do.”   A limitation of the study is that it relies on the self-reporting nature of the questionnaire. Future research should better identify drug and herbal interactions with chemotherapy, the study authors wrote in the Journal of Oncology Practice.   “Patients or family members of patients should explicitly ask if a clinical pharmacist has checked their medications for any significant drug interactions,” Bossaer said. “Some may require a medication change, and others may require more frequent lab monitoring.”  "
2t4REOf,2017-06-30,African-Americans who buy Medicare Advantage fare worse," (Reuters Health) - Medicare Advantage insurance plans may be creating a disadvantage for black patients who need major surgery, a new study suggests.   In New York State, where the study was done, black seniors on traditional Medicare were 33 percent more likely than whites to be readmitted to hospitals within a month of surgery, researchers found. Moreover, the disparity nearly doubled for black seniors covered by the more expensive and supposedly superior Medicare Advantage.    Blacks covered under private Medicare Advantage plans were 64 percent more likely than whites to be readmitted to hospitals within a month of surgery, according to the report in Health Affairs.    Medicare beneficiaries pay additional premiums for Medicare Advantage programs – commercial insurance plans touted as offering comprehensive disease management and care coordination to help seniors manage health conditions.    “Medicare Advantage has not been successful in reducing the readmission rate for black beneficiaries,” lead author Yue Li, a health policy professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, said in a phone interview. “What are the mechanisms? I don’t know for sure.”   The study analyzed data from 13,703 patients with traditional Medicare and 6,632 with Medicare Advantage plans who underwent one of six types of major surgeries in New York in 2013. All were 65 and older; the average age was 66.    Overall, 30-day readmission rates were almost identical for traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage patients: 13.2 percent among Medicare patients and 13.1 percent among Medicare Advantage patients.    For whites, Medicare Advantage reduced the likelihood of 30-day hospital readmission rates by more than 12 percent over traditional Medicare. For blacks, however, Medicare Advantage increased the odds of readmission by nearly 11 percent over traditional Medicare, the study found.    Dr. Joseph Betancourt, who directs The Disparities Solutions Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and was not involved with the new study, expected to see racial disparities in hospital readmissions. But the fact that the disparities were nearly twice as large for black Medicare Advantage patients compared to traditional Medicare patients surprised him.   “That gap’s pretty big,” he said in a phone interview. “So there’s something significant going on here. Now we need to figure out why is it worse – counterintuitively – if you have Medicare Advantage.”   Since Medicare was established in the U.S. more than 50 years ago, disparities in health outcomes have persisted between whites and blacks, prior studies have shown.   But the new report is the first to examine the impact of Medicare Advantage on the disparities, Li said. Medicare Advantage data is not generally available to researchers, but New York State granted access to Li and his colleagues.   “The great unknown is why do we see greater disparities in Medicare Advantage than in traditional Medicare,” Betancourt said. “The government is expecting if you get people into Medicare Advantage the readmission rate will be lower.”   “But as we move people toward Medicare Advantage, African-Americans have worse outcomes,” he said.   Though most people in the U.S. over age 65 receive health coverage through traditional Medicare, 31 percent were enrolled in private Medicare Advantage plans in 2015, the authors write.    In spite of financial incentives for Medicare Advantage plans to prevent unnecessary hospital admissions, previous research shows mixed results when comparing the two programs’ readmission rates.   Betancourt believes racial disparities could arise from challenges around communication, trust and health literacy when patients are discharged.   “These issues impact all populations, but they impact some more than others. It’s not just what happens in the hospital. Once they leave the hospital, do they have the services they need?” he asked.   “We can’t do one-size fits all,” he said. “We need to tailor our discharge process to meet the needs of diverse patient populations.”  "
2sKHxxh,2017-06-30,Being active may reduce risk of chronic low back pain," (Reuters Health) - Regularly engaging in physical activity, from walking to intense exercise, may help to reduce the risk of chronic low back pain by as much as 16 percent, according to a new review of previous studies.   In the past, it hasn’t been clear whether physical activity staves off low back pain, or people without back pain are more likely to be active, the researchers write in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. To help determine which comes first, the review team analyzed data from 36 studies that followed nearly 160,000 people over time who didn’t have back pain at the start.   “Systematic reviews of clinical trials suggest that exercise reduces low back pain intensity and its recurrence. In addition, the current review suggests that exercise or other leisure time activity also protects against developing chronic low back pain,” lead author Dr. Rhaman Shiri, a researcher with Finnish Institute of Occupational Health in Helsinki, told Reuters Health by email.   To standardize definitions from the various studies, Shiri and a colleague counted any non-work-related physical effort, including walking and climbing stairs, as physical activity in addition to sports or other forms of intentional exercise. People were considered active if they engaged in such physical activity at least once or twice a week for at least 30 to 60 minutes, or if they were in the middle or high end of total physical activity within their study group.    The researchers found that for moderately or highly active people, the risk of developing chronic low back pain was 14 percent and 16 percent, respectively, lower compared with people in the least-active category.   Chronic low back pain was defined as pain that lasts for three months or more, or pain for more than 30 days within the previous 12 months.    For acute or occasional low back pain, however, physical activity levels didn’t seem to make a difference in risk. The same was true of hospitalizations or disability leave related to low back pain.   Limitations of the review, the authors note, include the fact that some studies did not account for factors that might influence the results, such as work-related physical exertion, depression or smoking, all of which are associated with both lack of physical activity and risk of low back pain.    There were also too few elderly or very young adults to determine whether the apparent protective effect of physical activity is true for all age groups. Older people are more likely to be inactive as a result of back pain, for example, the authors point out.   People are becoming more and more aware of the need for activity, Dr. Joel Press told Reuters Health in a phone interview.   “We were meant to move. We were not meant to be stagnant in any way, so I think this study does confirm that. It’s a big study where they looked at a lot of people,” said Press, who is physiatrist-in-chief at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.    Usually, Press tells people who already have back pain to cut down on the sitting and increase movement with low-impact activities such as walking.   “Generally lower impact, walking type things are probably the starting point. Swimming is another low impact activity that puts less load on your back, but you’re still getting a lot of cardiovascular fitness and movement with it,” said Press, who was not involved in the current study.   It may be best to avoid starting out with sports that have a lot of twisting and turning, such as golf, baseball and tennis unless you take precautions to try not to get into a position where you’re going to make it worse, he noted.    “I think the biggest thing is, if you’re doing an activity and every time you’re doing it the pain intensifies while you’re doing the activity, or even afterward, you’re worse off than you were before,” Press said.   “If somebody does an exercise and they’re a little sore right afterward, but by later that day they feel fine, and the next day they’re no worse, they feel fine, that’s a green light - go ahead, you’re doing okay.”  "
2t5WzvK,2017-06-29,Experts may disagree on skin cancer diagnoses," (Reuters Health) - Experts tasked with identifying skin cancer in laboratories often disagree over diagnoses, according to a new study.   Nearly one in five suspected cases of skin cancer are likely diagnosed as more advanced than they really are, researchers found. Similarly, nearly one in five are likely diagnosed as less severe when they’re actually more severe.   “The diagnosis is made by a human,” said lead author Dr. Joann Elmore, of the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle. “There is no molecular marker or machine that will tell us what the diagnosis is.”   Doctors who analyze and interpret biopsy samples are called pathologists. Elmore said pathologists are not to blame for inconsistent results, however. The cases tend to be difficult to interpret.   “I had my own skin biopsy about a decade ago,” she said. “I ended up getting three different interpretations from three different people.”   “I realized this was an area I wanted to study and quantify,” she said.   Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The deadliest form of skin cancer in known as melanoma.    More than 76,500 people in the U.S. were diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer in 2014, according to the CDC. Nearly 9,500 people died of it that year.   Skin cancer is diagnosed after doctors take a sample of suspicious-looking skin from a patient. The sample is then sent to a lab where a pathologist looks at thin slices of the skin under a microscope to see if there are any signs of cancer. If cancer is found, the pathologists assigns it a stage, ranging from 1 to 5, with stage 5 being a cancer that has likely spread throughout the body.   For the new study, the researchers used 240 skin samples broken into sets of 36 or 48. The sets were then sent to 187 pathologists in 10 states for diagnoses. The same pathologists were asked to review the same set of slides at least eight months later.   For the earliest melanoma, known as stage 1, about 77 percent of pathologists issued the same diagnoses in both phases of the study. Similarly, about 83 percent of pathologists issued the same diagnoses twice for the most advanced melanoma cases.   Pathologists were less likely to confirm their diagnoses during the study’s second phase for melanomas in stage 2 through 4, according to the results in The BMJ.   The researchers also assembled a panel of three experienced pathologists to review the cases. The proportion of diagnoses the panel agreed with varied from 25 percent for stage 2 to 92 percent for stage 1.   Overall, the researchers say, if real-world melanoma diagnoses were reviewed by such an expert panel, only about 83 percent would be confirmed.    They estimate that 8 percent of real-life cases are likely assigned too high a stage. About 9 percent of cases are assigned too low a stage.   “Thankfully most of the biopsies are not of invasive melanoma,” said Elmore.   Dr. Ashfaq Marghoob, a dermatologist with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, said the results show that pathologists have high certainty when diagnosing biopsies that fall on the extremes of the stages.   “All the in-between cases, there is a potential you may waver,” said Marghoob, who wasn’t involved with the new study.   “This subjectivity has long been understood and recognized by both dermatologists and pathologists and has been demonstrated in previous studies,” said Dr. Jennifer DeFazio, who is also a dermatologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering and was also not involved with the new study.   Marghoob said the pathologist may diagnose a skin sample differently based on how they’re feeling that day or any number of factors.   “For me, it’s a study to (remind doctors that) pathology is not an exact science,” said Marghoob.  "
2t0NIxk,2017-06-29,More follow-up needed for elderly &#039;observed&#039; in hospitals," (Reuters Health) - When elderly patients stay in U.S. hospitals for “observation” but aren’t officially admitted, there’s a high likelihood they’ll soon be back for more hospital care, a new study shows.   One in five patients covered by Medicare, the federal insurance program for people over age 65, who were observed in a hospital but not admitted returned for a repeat visit within a month, researchers found.   Financial incentives and disincentives have led to an increase in the number of Medicare patients who spend up to 48 hours being observed in the hospital without being admitted. Today, 1.5 million Medicare beneficiaries are observed in hospitals each year, according to Dr. Kumar Dharmarajan, who led the study.   The new findings suggest that clinicians might need to focus more attention on caring for patients once they return home after being observed in the hospital, said Dharmarajan, a geriatrician and cardiologist at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.    “These people are quite vulnerable after discharge,” he said in a phone interview. “We need to think hard about helping improve transitions as people leave observation services.”   As reported in The BMJ, Dharmarajan and his team analyzed Medicare data from 2006-2011 on hundreds of thousands of emergency department visits, observation stays and inpatient stays (that is, when patients were admitted to the hospital). The number of emergency department and inpatient stays remained the same, while the number of observation stays increased during the period.   More than 20 percent of patients discharged from observation stays returned to the hospital within 30 days. In nearly half of those revisits, the patients ended up being officially admitted to the hospital, the study found.   “If one in five are coming back, there probably are opportunities to improve care for these patients,” Dharmarajan said.   For example, he said, protocols should be in place to ensure that patients discharged from observation stays have follow-up appointments with their physicians.   “This is a group that’s been relatively neglected from an outcomes perspective, and a group that’s not going away,” he said. “Could something different have been done in the hospital the first time, and could something different have been done after they left?”   Dr. Michael Ross, an emergency physician who oversees six observation units in Atlanta, Georgia, agreed that care coordination and, when possible, clinic visits within a week of observations stays can help reduce the number of patients who need to revisit hospitals after observation stays.   “They’re sick patients, and anything that could be done to prevent return visits would be a step forward,” he said in a phone interview. “I can’t conclude from the paper that more could be done, but in principle, I could say there’s always more that can be done with follow-up clinic visits and home care.”   Ross, a professor at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta who was not involved in the new study, believes it suggests the need for separate observation units with clear protocols for patients who are watched by physicians for up to two days to determine if they should be admitted.    About one-third of U.S. hospitals have dedicated observation units, which Ross said have better outcomes than observation stays in other parts of hospitals.   “A big gap in American healthcare is that observation patients need to be placed in dedicated observation units. In a bed anywhere, it’s the Wild West. There are no protocols,” he said.   “A protocol-driven observation unit is more prone to facilitating outpatient care and making sure all patients receive complete testing before discharge,” he said. If patients don’t complete their testing in the hospital, they’re more likely to need hospital care soon again, he added.  "
2siSDL9,2017-06-29,Hospitals may not consistently support breastfeeding targets," (Reuters Health) - Roughly half of breastfed newborns in New York State hospitals are also given formula, though there’s wide variation in feeding practices suggesting that differing hospital policies contribute to the problem, researchers say.   Pediatricians recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed infants until they’re at least 6 months of age because it can reduce babies’ risk of ear and respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, allergies, childhood obesity and diabetes.    Mothers can benefit too, with longer periods of breastfeeding linked to lower risks of depression, bone deterioration and certain cancers.   For the new study, researchers examined birth certificate data on 160,911 infants born at 126 hospitals statewide in 2014. Overall, they found, 48.5 percent of infants who were fed breast milk were also given formula.    Just 18.2 percent of breastfed newborns received formula at community hospitals that treat low-risk patients, compared to 50.6 percent to 57 percent at hospitals that handle more complex cases. But certain groups, including black, Hispanic, Asian and less educated mothers, had higher odds of supplementation at community hospitals.     “Every mother should have an equal chance to be supported to exclusively breastfeed,” said Dr. Lori Feldman-Winter, a pediatrics researcher at Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, New Jersey, who wasn’t involved in the study.   Compared to white babies at community hospitals, black and Hispanic infants were almost twice as likely to get formula supplements, and the odds were almost three times higher for Asian newborns, the study found.    Babies of color were also more likely to get formula at hospitals that treat more complex cases, but the differences relative to white infants were not as pronounced.    At community hospitals, mothers without a high school degree were almost three times more likely to get formula for their babies than women with at master’s degree; at regional perinatal centers that treat the most complex patients the odds were doubled.    Women insured by Medicaid, the government health program for the poor, were 60 percent more likely to get formula for their babies as women with other insurance at regional perinatal centers; at community hospitals the odds increased by 27 percent.    Across all hospital levels, there were some places that met the HealthyPeople 2020 goal of reducing the proportion of newborns who receive supplemental formula to no more than 14 percent. This benchmark was set to encourage exclusive breastfeeding as often as possible while allowing for cases when women may be unable to do this.    One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on mothers’ planned feeding intentions or the reasons why the infant was supplemented with formula, the study authors, led by Dr. Trang Nguyen of the New York State Department of Health, write in the journal Pediatrics.    Medical evidence clearly shows that breastfeeding is crucial to the healthy growth and development of infants, and also provides important health benefits to mothers, the health department said in an emailed statement. Breastfeeding data for each hospital in the state is available on the health department’s website (here:  on.ny.gov/2tZwrmA ).   Formula supplements may be needed in some circumstances, such as when the mother and infant are separated due to serious medical issues, when a baby has jaundice or when a newborn has very low birth weight or loses more weight than expected after birth, said Jennifer Yourkavitch, a certified lactation counselor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who wasn’t involved in the study.   But it still is done too often, Feldman-Winter said.    “It is normal for mothers to produce very little milk volume during the first days of breastfeeding, and this is accompanied by normal weight loss in their babies,” Feldman-Winter said by email. “Over-supplementing with infant formula can lead to excess weight gain during the first years of life, and that is associated with being overweight at two years of age.”  "
2t1BYZG,2017-06-28,Fewer U.S. cancer survivors breathing secondhand smoke," (Reuters Health) - Cancer survivors are less than half as likely to be exposed to secondhand smoke as they were a generation ago, a U.S. study suggests.                     A cigarette butt lies on a street in New York, U.S., May 10, 2017. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton      Even when they don’t smoke themselves, cancer patients who regularly breathe indoor air contaminated by tobacco smoke can have higher death rates and an increased risk of heart attack and strokes, the authors write in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.    For the study, researchers analyzed data on secondhand smoke exposure for 686 cancer survivors in nationally representative surveys done in two-year cycles from 1999 to 2012. Overall, only about 16 percent of participants were exposed to secondhand smoke by the end of the study period, down from roughly 40 percent at the beginning.    While the decline is encouraging, the trouble with the results is that these cancer survivors are being exposed to secondhand smoke at rates similar to the general population, said lead study author Dr. Oladimeji Akinboro, of Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York.    “It may reflect a lack of appreciation, on the part of patients with certain types of cancer along with their close household and social contacts, of the dangers that ongoing exposure of cancer patients and survivors to tobacco smoke, such as higher death rates,” Akinboro said by email.    “Furthermore, ongoing exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke in the home makes it less likely that smokers who have, or have had cancer, will quit smoking,” Akinboro added.    To examine trends in secondhand exposure, researchers looked at interview data from survey participants and also examined results from blood tests for levels of cotinine, a breakdown product of nicotine that marks exposure to tobacco smoke.    Overall, about 28 percent of adult cancer survivors in the study had been exposed to secondhand smoke and about 5 percent reported living in a household where someone smoked. But certain segments of the population had much higher rates of exposure.    For example, 26 percent of white people in the study were exposed to secondhand smoke, compared with 56 percent of black participants.    About 22 percent of people with some education beyond high school breathed secondhand smoke, compared to 42 percent of people who didn’t finish high school.    And, 53 percent of the poorest people in the study had secondhand smoke exposure - more than double the odds for the most affluent individuals.    The risk was also higher for people with lung tumors and other smoking-related cancers: 36 percent had been exposed to secondhand smoke compared with 26 percent of people who had malignancies not linked to smoking.    “It’s difficult to explain the disparities,” said Dr. Maher Karam-Hage, associate medical director of the tobacco treatment program at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.    With less education, people might not fully understand the risks, Karam-Hage, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. And with less income, people might not be able to afford to move to avoid secondhand smoke exposure at home.    “In addition, those who are survivors of smoking-related cancers may have been smokers themselves and/or had smokers as household members and therefore continue to be exposed to their household members smoking,” Karam-Hage said. “Patients can use these solid and irrefutable data and findings as evidence to help them advocate with others the need to establish safe and healthy living areas.”  "
2sPKef2,2017-06-28,Air pollution limits in U.S. inadequate to prevent deaths," (Reuters Health) - With the Trump Administration threatening to loosen air pollution controls, a new study is showing that even existing rules are causing tens of thousands of extra deaths in the United States each year.                    A truck engine is tested for pollution exiting its exhaust pipe as California Air Resources field representatives (unseen) work a checkpoint set up to inspect heavy-duty trucks traveling near the Mexican-U.S. border in Otay Mesa, California September 10, 2013.  REUTERS/Mike Blake      Researchers used 12 years of data - health records from nearly 61 million Medicare beneficiaries, combined with a massive databank of pollution readings - to link specific air quality levels to death rates.   They found that for every increase of just 10 micrograms in small-particle pollution known as PM2.5, the death rate went up 7.3 percent. That’s the equivalent of 120,000 fatalities among people age 65 and older, lead author Qian Di of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.   For every 10 part-per-billion rise in ozone concentration, the mortality rate rose by 1.1 percent, producing an extra 19,000 deaths just among the elderly.   Even in years when the concentrations in a region were low, “we continued to see significant associations between exposure and mortality,” Di and his colleagues write in the New England Journal of Medicine.   Their conclusion: current U.S. rules are not strict enough to prevent pollution-related deaths and further reductions in pollution will produce a big drop in fatalities.   “It is clear from this study that there is not really a safe level of air pollution,” said Dr. Brian W. Christman, vice chair of the department of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, who was not involved in the research.   “The Clean Air Act and the Environmental Protection Agency have done great work, but the data indicates that additional effort to reduce PM2.5 and ozone would save lives,” Christman, who is also a spokesman for the American Lung Association, told Reuters Health by phone. “As a matter of fact, further reduction in PM2.5 below the (federal standard) of 12 micrograms per cubic meter are likely to be even more effective than previous reductions.”   Senior study author Francesca Dominici, a professor of biostatistics at Harvard, told Reuters Health in a telephone interview that she hoped the findings “will change the course of recent discussions about dismantling EPA and EPA research and leaving the Paris agreement” designed to slow global climate change by reducing pollution levels.   “The evidence we’re seeing here is very compelling,” she said.   The results come at a time when the Trump administration has begun “to dismantle guidelines intended to reduce emissions from coal-fired electricity plants” and may revoke the waiver that allowed California to adopt stricter vehicle emission standards, according to an editorial accompanying the study.   “Revoking this waiver could have the effect of exposing more than 100 million Americans to higher levels of automobile emissions,” the Journal warns. “Trump’s proposed budget includes crippling cuts to the EPA, including cuts in funding for both federal and state enforcement of regulations. The increased air pollution that would result from loosening current restrictions would have devastating effects on public health.”   The particles studied are dangerous because their tiny size - only visible with an electron microscope - allows them to get deep into the lungs to do damage, and from there they can also enter the bloodstream. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, from 2000 to 2015 the average concentration of PM 2.5 pollution nationally has declined by 37 percent thanks to stricter air standards.   According to the new study, the two regions that saw the greatest improvements in air quality were the central and southeastern United States.    Satellite and weather data, computer models and data from 1,928 particle monitoring stations and 1,877 ozone modeling stations were used to estimate exposure over each square kilometer of the country.   The task was so massive the number crunching had to be done by supercomputer over Harvard’s Christmas break, Di noted.   Because the database was so large, Di and his colleagues were also able to determine that subgroups, including men, blacks, Asians, Hispanics and people eligible for the Medicaid health plan for the poor faced the highest risk from small particle pollution.   It shows “this is not just a health issue, but a social equality issue as well,” said Di, a doctoral student in Harvard’s department of environmental health.  "
2siIOwA,2017-06-28,Bullied teens report more gun access," (Reuters Health) - U.S. teens who report being bullied are three times more likely to say they have access to loaded guns than kids who weren’t bullied, a new study found.   “Interventions, training and policies (are needed) to protect the wellbeing not only of these students, but their fellow students, their neighborhoods and their communities at large,” said lead author Maayan Simckes, of the University of Washington in Seattle.   Access to guns is a risk factor for injury and death - and that risk may be exacerbated among youngsters already at high risk for these outcomes, such as bullied teens, Simckes and her colleagues write in the Journal of Adolescent Health.   Past studies found bullied teens carry guns more often than those not bullied, but little is known about their access to those weapons, the researchers write.   They used data collected from a nationally representative sample of 10,704 adolescents participating in the National Crime Victimization Survey. In addition to asking respondents about past bullying, the survey also asks if the teens have access to a loaded gun without adult permission.   That could mean, for example, that the teen knew how to get a gun from a safe and load it without asking an adult for help or a key.   Overall, 4.2 percent of teens said they had access to a loaded weapon without adult permission.   Nearly 19 percent of students reported traditional bullying that may be faced in school or on the playground, about 2 percent reported cyber bullying over the internet and about 6 percent reported both types of bullying.   Among the nearly 74 percent of students who weren’t bullied, about 3 percent reported access to a loaded gun without adult permission. That proportion rose to about 5 percent among teens who experienced traditional bullying, and to 9 percent among those who were victims of cyber bullying.   In the group of teens who reported both traditional and cyber bullying, 15 percent reported access to a loaded gun without adult permission.   Simckes told Reuters Health that the new study can’t explain why bullied teens are more likely to have unrestricted access to loaded guns. Future research needs to examine that question.   Additionally, people should understand the close relationship between gun access and bullying, Simckes said.   “For example, in pediatric offices, when we have conversations about gun access, we should also be discussing bullying,” she said.   Dr. Andrew Adesman, of Northwell Health’s Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children’s Medical Center in New Hyde Park, New York, recently found bullied teens are more likely to bring guns to school.   “Obviously, you can’t bring a gun to school unless you have access,” he told Reuters Health.   The risk that teens will bring a gun to school goes up even more when they face threats of physical violence, said Adesman, who wasn’t involved with the new study.   He said gun owners need to take precautions.   “Parents who are responsible gun owners should make sure they have their weapons secured,” said Adesman.  "
2tlAAUu,2017-06-27,"Fewer admissions for heart failure, but blacks still fare worse than whites"," (Reuters Health) - Between 2002 and 2013, hospital admissions for heart failure fell by nearly a third in the U.S., but blacks are still more than twice as likely as whites to be hospitalized for the condition, researchers say.   “These findings are impressive and suggest that efforts to prevent heart failure and improve the outpatient treatment of heart failure have had overall success in reducing the number of heart failure patients needing hospitalizations,” senior study author Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow from David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles told Reuters Health. “However, the improvements were not equally distributed across race/ethnicities and genders, and additional efforts are needed.”    Fonarow’s team used information from a national registry of U.S. hospitalizations to investigate trends in heart failure hospital admissions in the decade between 2002 and 2013, when there were a total of more than 12 million hospitalizations for heart failure.   When adjusted for age, heart failure hospitalization rates fell by 30.8 percent, an average of 3.3 percent per year, during this period. Overall, rates dropped faster for women, falling 36.0 percent, than for men, for whom they fell 25.8 percent.    Hospitalization rates decreased at about the same rate for whites (29.6 percent) and for blacks (29.4 percent), but throughout this time, rates were more than twice as high among black men and women, according to the report in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.   Hispanics experienced a greater decrease in heart failure hospitalization rates, which dropped by 48.4 percent, narrowing their rates relative to whites to within a few percentage points.    Similarly, heart failure hospitalization rates dropped dramatically, by 47.5 percent, among Asians and Pacific Islanders. By 2013, they were 43 percent lower than those for whites.    “Heart failure is largely preventable, and the disparities identified can be reduced or eliminated,” Fonarow said. “The findings highlight the urgent need to address population-based health and prevention, with specific targeting of those most at risk. Equitable health is achievable but will take multidimensional national, community, and local efforts,” he told Reuters Health by email.    “In particular, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for developing heart failure, and achieving optimal blood pressure levels can reduce the risk by more than half. Better awareness, treatment, and control of blood pressure, particularly for black men and women is critical,” Fonarow said.    “The time to intensify equitable efforts to prevent and optimize the treatment of heart failure is now,” he said.    “That blacks have a 2.5x higher hospitalization rate for heart failure compared to whites is an important finding,” Dr. Parag Goyal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “As the authors point out, the degree of this disparity (specifically in heart failure) has largely been under-appreciated to date, as prior studies have failed to adjust for the younger age distribution of blacks compared to whites.”    Goyal said he hopes the study will stimulate further exploration of the reasons underlying these differences.   “These race-related disparities likely go beyond a genetic or physiologic basis; consequently, there is a need to develop population-based interventions to reduce the significant burden of hospitalizations faced by blacks with heart failure,” Goyal said. “Future research should focus on examining the unique vulnerabilities of blacks with heart failure that may underlie this finding.”    Dr. Jia-Rong Wu from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Nursing has explored health disparities in patients with heart failure based on ethnicity and financial status and agrees that money and higher rates of other health conditions are important factors.   “However,” she said by email, “in addition to socioeconomic and clinical factors, we found some behavioral factors were associated with cardiac/heart failure hospitalizations. Therefore, it is important to optimize heart failure management and control/manage risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia),” Wu said.    “It is equally important to develop interventions/strategies to help black patients with heart failure to improve self-care behaviors to eliminate the disparities.”   "
2tO6zKj,2017-06-26,Heart-healthy goals tied to lower blood pressure among blacks," (Reuters Health) - Black Americans may be able to lower their risk for high blood pressure by following the seven heart-healthy steps laid out by the American Heart Association (AHA), according to a new study.   The AHA’s “Life’s Simple 7” program focuses on seven goals: a healthy weight, a healthy diet, healthy physical activity levels, quitting smoking, and good control of blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol.   The risk of high blood pressure decreased as the number of heart healthy habits followed by black Americans increased, researchers found.   Starting in childhood, black Americans are at higher risk of high blood pressure than white Americans, the researchers write in the journal Hypertension. But while maintaining a healthy blood pressure is key to reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease, not many studies have focused specifically on ways to improve blood pressure control among black Americans.   “This is such a high risk in this population, and it hasn’t been studied that much,” said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, an AHA spokesperson who wasn’t involved in the new research.   For the new study, the researchers studied 1,878 black Americans enrolled in the Jackson Heart Study in Mississippi. All of the participants were free of high blood pressure when they entered the study between 2000 and 2004, and they all received at least one follow-up exam.   Over about eight years of follow-up, about half of the participants were diagnosed with high blood pressure.   Overall, at the start of the study, about 57 percent of participants had two or three risk factors under control. Another 36 percent had control of four to six factors.  About 7 percent had just one risk factor, or none at all, under control. No one had control of all seven.   During the study, the risk of developing high blood pressure was roughly 81 percent for people with control over one or no risk factors at the start of the study, 67 percent with two risk factors under control at the start, 55 percent in people with three risk factors under control, 33 percent when people had four risk factors under control, 26 percent when five factors were controlled, and 11 percent with six factors under control.   The difference between people with control of one or no risk factors and those with control of six represents a 90 percent decreased risk of high blood pressure.   “In looking at these healthy behaviors and factors, we see that with implementation of these the risk of hypertension and outcomes goes down significantly,” said Steinbaum, of Northwell Health’s Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. “I think it’s a pretty powerful statement.”   The researchers conclude that Life’s Simple 7 may be a practical way to monitor the risk of high blood pressure among black Americans.   For people looking to follow the AHA’s Life’s Simple 7, Steinbaum said it’s about baby steps like cutting out sugary drinks such as juices. Removing those drinks leads to weight loss which may increase physical activity, she said.   “One small change can really set off a whole pattern of behavior that can change your life,” she told Reuters Health.   John Booth, the study’s lead author from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  "
2sIG4HA,2017-06-26,Medicaid cuts linked to later breast cancer diagnosis," (Reuters Health) - More women may be diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and suffer treatment delays when Medicaid cutbacks eliminate coverage for many adults with low-income jobs, a study in Tennessee suggests.    In 2005, nearly 170,000 people lost their medical insurance after cuts to TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program. For the new study, researchers compared data from before and after that year, to see how long it took to diagnose and treat breast cancer in women living in low-income versus high-income zip codes in Tennessee.   In low-income areas, where more residents were insured through Medicaid, the proportion of breast cancer cases diagnosed at a late stage when tumors had spread rose from 35.4 percent in 2002-2004 – before the Medicaid cuts – to 40.2 percent in 2006-2008, researchers note in the journal Cancer.   “When women lose access to health insurance, they may be less likely to receive recommended mammograms and have access to regular primary care services that would facilitate an early diagnosis of cancer,” said senior study author Lindsay Sabik, a public health researcher at the University of Pittsburgh.   “A growing body of evidence shows that health insurance coverage, and Medicaid in particular, is associated with having a usual source of health care, access to primary care, and use of preventive services,” Sabik said by email.    The majority of the women in the study were white, married and insured.   Researchers defined low-income zip codes as areas where at least half the residents had annual income of no more than $38,700 in 2005, equivalent to 200 percent of the federal poverty level for a family of four. In high-income zip codes, half of the people made more than that each year.    In the high-income areas, the proportion of breast cancer cases diagnosed at a late stage increased from 34.6 percent before the 2005 Medicaid cuts to 36.2 percent afterward, the study found.    There was a 3.3 percentage point increase in late-stage diagnosis for women living in low-income zip codes relative to women living in high-income zip codes.   Both in poorer and more affluent areas, women were more likely to experience surgery and treatment delays after the Medicaid cuts, but the change was more pronounced in high-income zip codes.    The proportion of women who waited more than 60 days for surgery after their diagnosis rose from 12 percent before the cuts to 14.3 percent afterward in low-income areas, while it increased from 10.2 percent to 14.4 percent in high-income zip codes.    Limitations of the study include the lack of data on whether diagnosis and treatment delays translated into worse survival odds for women with breast cancer and the lack of data on how many women in the study actually lost Medicaid benefits as a result of the 2005 cuts, the authors note.    Still, the results have implications for other states considering Medicaid cuts, because treatment and diagnosis delays can make treatment more difficult and more expensive, the researchers argue.    Federal and state lawmakers are considering rollbacks of Medicaid expansions implemented under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, to save money or address fiscal shortfalls, Sujha Subramanian, a health economics and policy researcher at RTI International in Waltham, Massachusetts, writes in an accompanying editorial.    “Losing Medicaid coverage will have detrimental impact on cancer patients,” Subramanian said by email.    Survival odds are worse with later diagnosis, Subramanian said. When breast cancer is caught early, before tumors have spread, 98.9 percent of patients survive five years after diagnosis, but this drops to only 26.9 percent when malignancies have spread far beyond the breast.    Costs may keep some women from getting symptoms like a lump in their breast checked out, Subramanian added.    “Affordability is a huge issue and even if women realize they are experiencing potential breast cancer symptoms, they will delay seeking care as they may not have the funds required to pay for the diagnostic procedures,” Subramanian added. “In addition, providers generally charge higher fees for those without insurance coverage.”  "
2t2NDdz,2017-06-23,Young kids may have mature biases against overweight people," (Reuters Health) - Kids may develop an implicit bias against overweight and obese people early in childhood that leads them to make quick judgments based only on size, a small experiment suggests.    The study tested snap judgments made by youngsters ages 9 to 11 right after they’d seen pictures of children with varied body shapes.   Participants were briefly shown pictures of older children who were similar to each other in age, race and sex but of different weights. Right after that, they briefly viewed images of meaningless fractals and were asked to rate these abstract geometric patterns as “good” or “bad.”   After seeing pictures of healthy weight children, the participants gave 64 percent of the fractals a “good” rating, compared with just 59 percent of the fractals they saw after looking at overweight children.   If the participants had no implicit weight bias, researchers would expect them to rate half of the fractals “good” and the other half “bad,” the study authors say. A difference in the proportion of “good” ratings after pictures of healthy weight versus overweight children, however, indicates implicit bias.   “What’s surprising here is that the bias is similar to that seen for race, and shows us that even kids already have strong preferences based on weight,” said lead study author Asheley Cockrell Skinner of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina.    The children had to make their judgments in a hurry. They only saw pictures of other children for 350 milliseconds, followed by an image of a fractal for 200 milliseconds.    Each participant viewed eight pairs of images. Pictures showed children engaged in a variety of activities like reading, running, standing and studying. In the pictures, children wore similar outfits and had similar facial expressions.    The difference in percentages of “good” fractal ratings - that is, the degree of young participants’ implicit bias - depended on how much the participants themselves weighed.   Overall, the implicit bias rate was 5.4 percent, researchers report in Pediatrics. But among healthy-weight participants, the implicit bias rate was 7.9 percent, compared with 1.4 percent for overweight participants.    “It’s possible children with obesity have greater exposure to other people, such as family members, who have obesity; (they) may be more accepting of obesity; or healthy children may not see children with obesity as `like them,’ which affects their preferences,” Skinner said by email.    Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include its group of mostly white, affluent participants recruited from a single location, the authors note. This might mean the results would be different in a more diverse group of children.    Still, the findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that weight bias starts early, said Rebecca Pearl, a researcher at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Prior research has shown that children as young as preschool age show preferences for thin versus overweight peers,” Pearl, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Parents can influence this, however, said Dr. Anne McTiernan, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.   “Parents should teach their children to be accepting of people of all sizes,” McTiernan, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “They can also screen for images their children see on TV and on the Internet.”   They should also lead by example, said Justin Ryder, a pediatrics researcher at the University of Minnesota Medical School who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Using terms like fat, unhealthy, lazy, bad, ugly, etc. in reference to a person struggling with being overweight or obese is likely to build a negative attitude toward that people of that body shape over time,” Ryder said by email. “Parents likely do not realize their own implicit bias toward persons who are overweight or obese, making this a challenge.”  "
2tTRCFt,2017-06-23,Breast implant techniques vary widely around the world," Reuters Health - From country to country, breast implant surgeries tend to vary widely in technique, as well as in type and size of implant, according to an international survey of surgeons.   The procedures should be standardized using best practices, the study authors argue in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal.   Breast enlargement is the most commonly performed cosmetic surgery worldwide, the authors write, with more than 1.5 million procedures done in 2015.   “Breast augmentation surgery remains one of the most frequently performed aesthetic surgical procedures, with trends increasing,” said senior author Dr. Niclas Broer of Technical University Teaching Hospital in Munich, Germany.   “However, there exists a plethora of possible technical approaches, and the procedure is not very standardized,” he told Reuters Health by email. “This is very interesting but also almost a little bit concerning.”   Broer and colleagues analyzed responses from 628 surgeons around the world to a 38-question online survey. The surgeons were asked about current controversies, new technologies, common practices, technical considerations, and characteristics of their patients.    In most countries in Europe, Asia and Oceania, surgeons use anatomically shaped implants, whereas in the United States and Latin America, 90 percent use round implants. Surgeons ranked the higher cost and lack of proof of aesthetic superiority as the top reasons why they don’t use anatomical implants more often.    “The different use of round versus shaped implants is striking,” Broer said. “Is the U.S. slow to embrace the use of a new technology, or do patients in the U.S. prefer a different look?”   Worldwide, more than 80 percent of surgeons only use 100 percent silicone implants. In the U.S., just 22 percent of surgeons use them.    More than two-thirds of surgeons in the U.S. and Australia use implants larger than 300 cc, or approximately two cup sizes, and in the U.S., more than a third use implant sizes larger than 350 cc, the study also found.    Practices differ by technique and post-surgery treatment as well. Many use similar incisions to create an implant pocket, and most use antibiotics as anesthesia begins. In the U.S. and Asia, however, more than half of surgeons recommend a postoperative implant massage, while surgeons in all other countries don’t.    The study authors found one worldwide agreement - the majority of surgeons said implants don’t make it harder to detect abnormalities on mammograms.   “It is important for patients to have high quality information during the decision-making process to reduce the inherent risk that surgery has,” said Dr. Carlos Rubi Ona of IMED Hospitals in Valencia, Spain, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Aesthetic surgery is a cosmetic procedure, but we should not forget that it carries the same risk of complications, if not even more, as many other non-aesthetic procedures,” he told Reuters Health by email.   In most other surgical procedures, certain operative approaches are considered standard universally. Slight variations exist, but for the most part, a consistent standard draws from current research and accepted practice, Broer said.   “Why should breast augmentation surgery be any different?” he said. “If, for instance, it has been shown that silicone implants provide superior outcomes, why are so many women still receiving an inferior product?”   Broer and colleagues suggest creating an international task force that meets yearly to evaluate best practices and new evidence to standardize the procedure. This should include guidelines about antibiotics, incision technique and location, and implant pockets, Broer said.   “Augmentation surgery should be taken as seriously as a colon resection or gallbladder removal,” he said. “If we found international practice differences for those, it would almost be a scandal.”  "
2svhgCI,2017-06-22,Relatives of people with fatty liver cirrhosis also at risk," (Reuters Health) - If a parent or sibling has cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a person’s odds of having liver scarring are more than 12 times higher than for people without close relatives who have this condition, a small study finds.    Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the build-up of extra fat in liver cells that is not caused by drinking alcohol. It’s the most common cause of liver disease in the U.S., the study team writes in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.    The more severe form of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), tends to develop in people who are overweight or obese or who have diabetes, high cholesterol or high triglycerides, according to the American Liver Foundation.    With NAFLD, the liver may swell and develop scarring, known as fibrosis, or cirrhosis in its more advanced stages. NASH often leads to more serious liver diseases, including liver cancer. About a quarter of people with NASH have cirrhosis.   Past research has suggested that NAFLD can run in families, but it wasn’t known if family members are also prone to developing fibrosis and more serious liver diseases.    “My goal is to change practice to develop screening guidelines for who are the patients who are at high risk for developing cirrhosis and should we be screening them,” said senior study author Dr. Rohit Loomba of the NAFLD Research Center at the University of California, San Diego in La Jolla.   One reason family members’ risk was poorly understood is that a diagnosis of fibrosis required a biopsy, which is a painful medical procedure. But Loomba and colleagues devised a way to detect fat and scarring in the liver using MRI scanning.     For the current study, Loomba and colleagues enrolled 26 patients with NAFLD and cirrhosis, along with 39 of their parents or siblings, as well as 69 people without liver disease plus 69 of their first-degree relatives.   The study team took medical histories, performed medical examinations and used MRI to evaluate the livers of all participants.   They found that three quarters of the relatives of patients with NAFLD and cirrhosis also had NAFLD.    Seven of these people, 18 percent of family members, also had advanced liver fibrosis, compared to 1.4 percent of the relatives of controls. The family members of NAFLD-cirrhosis patients were 12.5 times more likely to have liver fibrosis than the healthy comparison families.   “The data’s very compelling. It reinforces smaller and less well-conducted studies that indicate a higher likelihood of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis among family members,” said Dr. Scott Friedman, a liver disease specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who wasn’t involved in the study.   “So, it’s important, because it may heighten our concern about the risk of undiagnosed liver disease in first-degree relatives of patients who’ve been diagnosed with NAFLD, particularly those who have more advanced fibrosis,” Friedman said in a phone interview.   There has been a rising awareness and incidence of liver disease associated with so-called metabolic syndrome, which is a constellation of abnormalities usually including obesity, insulin resistance, high blood pressure and high blood fats, Friedman noted.   “We’re still trying to understand, certainly, what’s the cause, what are the risk factors, who is at highest risk, how do we screen for those patients, and what do we do when we detect disease,” he said.   It’s important to note that aside from genetic contributions, first-degree relatives often share the same lifestyle habits, he added.    Currently, there are no proven therapies except diet and weight loss, which is hard to sustain. “But, there is an intense effort in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry to come up with new drugs to treat those conditions before it progresses to the cirrhotic state, where cancer and liver failure are real concerns,” Friedman said.   Loomba said new therapies are emerging. “There are about five Phase 3 trials for the treatment of NASH and especially advanced fibrosis in NASH.”    Once a patient develops cirrhosis, there’s a risk of developing liver cancer and those individuals need to be screened for that, Loomba added.   “We have a series of tests that need to be done on those individuals. And then, if the patient is obese for example and if they lose weight then you can even reverse fibrosis or progression of the disease.”  "
2sZAz8n,2017-06-22,Racism tied to worse asthma symptoms for black youth," (Reuters Health) - African-American children and young adults with a hard-to-treat type of asthma may have a more difficult time keeping symptoms in check when they have experienced racial discrimination, a recent study suggests.    Researchers asked 576 black youth in the U.S. with asthma whether they had been hassled, made to feel inferior or prevented from doing something because of their race, ethnicity, color or language in situations at school, in medical settings or at restaurants and stores. Roughly half of them reported experiencing some form of discrimination at some point in their lives.    When they had not experienced these forms of discrimination, the children and young adults were almost twice as likely to have well-controlled asthma than when they had, researchers report in the journal PLoS One.    “Discrimination is a form of stress, and thus, its effect on asthma may be all or mostly due to stress,” said study co-author Dr. Luisa Borrell, a public health and health policy researcher at the City University of New York.    “Racial or ethnic discrimination experiences could affect our response to medications by changing our airway tissues and mucous production,” Borrell said by email.    The link between symptom control and discrimination was even more pronounced for a subset of participants who had high levels of an immune-system signaling molecule known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in their blood. It is a protein that’s involved in inflammation and elevated in asthma patients who don’t respond well to standard medications.    Still, even among the participants with high TNF-alpha levels, the youth who didn’t experience discrimination were almost three times more likely to have well-controlled asthma symptoms than their peers who did experience racism.    To assess symptom control, researchers tested how participants responded to albuterol, an inhaled bronchodilator that is used as a rescue therapy to open inflamed airways when people have an asthma attack. People who have frequent attacks may also be prescribed corticosteroids to control their symptoms.    “In asthma that is well controlled, you would expect a low response to albuterol since the patient is not having a lot of symptoms and their airways are not inflamed,” said co-senior study author Dr. Neeta Thakur of the University of California, San Francisco.   “But in people who are not prescribed control medications, or are under-dosed, you might see a higher response,” Thakur said in a statement.    When researchers did lung function tests before and after giving participants albuterol, they found people who experienced discrimination had a bigger response to albuterol than those who didn’t.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that discrimination directly worsens asthma symptoms.    Another limitation is the possibility that factors such as segregated neighborhoods, exposure to indoor or outdoor air pollution, violence in the community or other social and economic disadvantages might at least partially explain the connection between discrimination and asthma symptoms found in the study, the authors note.    “Race, ethnicity and social class are important proxies for unmeasured factors that influence health outcomes,” said Dr. Avni Joshi of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota.    “A child who is in a poor housing situation, is more likely to come from a less educated family, which in turn are likely to be low income with incomplete or poor health coverage and access to care,” Joshi, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “It is in these families that the stress levels are likely high due to insecurities for food, money and perceived or actual discrimination in all spheres of life.”   Controlling stress, however, might help keep asthma symptoms in check, said Dr. Elizabeth Matsui of Johns Hopkins Children’s Center in Baltimore.    “The details of how stress leads to inflammation are not clear, but links between stress and inflammation have been shown repeatedly, and asthma is a disease characterized by inflammation in the lungs,” Matsui, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “We know that stress is broadly a risk factor for worse asthma, so stress management to reduce stress is appropriate.”  "
2sUSZqs,2017-06-22,Mothers’ obesity tied to increased risk of birth defects," (Reuters Health) - Even among obese pregnant women, being heavier is associated with a higher risk of having babies with serious birth defects, a Swedish study suggests.   Obesity has long been tied to an increased risk of pregnancy complications for mothers and their infants. The current study examined data on 1.2 million births in Sweden and found that the odds of problems like heart defects, nervous system malformations and limb deformities rises along with the severity of mothers’ obesity at the start of the pregnancy.    For normal-weight women, the risk of serious birth defects was 3.4 percent, the study found. For obese mothers, the risk ranged from 3.8 percent to 4.7 percent, increasing as women carried more excess weight based on their body mass index (BMI), researchers report in The BMJ.     “The sensitive period of fetal organ development is the first eight weeks of pregnancy and it is in particular during this time BMI may have a negative impact,” said lead study author Dr. Martina Persson of the Karolinska Institute and Sachsska Children’s Hospital in Stockholm.   “This means that it is important to try to obtain a body weight as close to normal as possible before conception,” Persson said by email.   To assess the relationship between degrees of maternal obesity and the odds of birth defects, researchers examined records for singleton births across Sweden between 2001 and 2014.    They grouped women based on their BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, at the time of their first prenatal visit. Underweight women had a BMI of less than 18.5, normal-weight mothers had a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, and overweight people had a BMI of 25 to 29.9.    Women with the least severe obesity, known as “class I” had a BMI of 30 to 34.9, followed by class II with a BMI of 35 to 39.9, and the most severe obesity, class III, with a BMI of 40 or more.    Overall, 43,550 babies, or 3.5 percent, had major congenital malformations. Heart defects were the most common, followed by defects of the genital organs, limbs, urinary system, digestive system and nervous system.   The overall risk of serious birth defects was 4.1 percent for boys and 2.8 percent for girls.    After accounting for other factors that can influence the odds of birth defects such as mothers’ age, marital status, education, country of birth and smoking status, researchers found the most severely obese women in the study were 37 percent more likely to have babies with birth defects than normal weight mothers.   Although the largest number of malformations involved the heart, the greatest rise in risk linked to obesity was for nervous system problems. Compared to normal-weight mothers, the risk of nervous system malformations rose by 44 percent to 88 percent with increasing severity of obesity.    While the study didn’t show why more severe obesity carried a higher risk of birth defects, it’s possible that health problems related to excess weight such as increased inflammation, abnormal metabolism, increased sensitivity to the hormone insulin and impaired vascular function all might play a role, Persson said.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that more severe obesity directly causes higher odds of birth defects.   Another limitation of the study is that it only included live births. Miscarriages, still births and induced abortions are more common when babies have serious defects, the authors note.    Even so, it confirms previous research linking obesity to birth defects and offers fresh insight into the potential for the magnitude of mothers’ excess weight to influence babies’ odds of these problems, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.   “This is important because it suggests that even if a woman can’t reduce her pre-pregnancy weight down to normal, even reducing one weight class can reduce the risk of complications,” Caughey, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   Ideally, all women would start pregnancy at healthy weight, Caughey added.   “That may not be entirely possible for many women, but even then a healthy diet and regular exercise is really important,” Caughey said.   "
2sqxmxp,2017-06-21,More playtime with dad linked to lower obesity risk for young kids," (Reuters Health) - Fathers who get more involved in raising their children may be helping to lower their kids’ risk of obesity, a U.S. study suggests.    For the study, researchers examined how often fathers of young children participated in parenting activities like caregiving, making meals and playing outside and how much they weighed in on decisions related to nutrition, health and discipline when their kids were 2 and 4 years old.    By age 4, kids were 30 percent less likely to be obese if their fathers increased the amount of time they spent taking children outside for walks and play, compared to those whose dads remained more hands-off or even reduced their involvement between their kids’ second and fourth birthdays.    Each additional daily caregiving task fathers handled - such as help with getting dressed, baths, brushing teeth and bedtime routines - was associated with an additional 33 percent reduction in their child’s odds of becoming obese, the study found.    “It is possible that when fathers are more involved, the total amount of time both parents dedicate to child caregiving increases - it’s not just the mother providing care but the father as well,” said lead study author Michelle Wong of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.    “When both parents are more involved, the quality of care might also increase,” Wong said by email.    About 9 percent of U.S. kids aged 2 to 5 are obese, as are about 18 percent of youth aged 6 to 11, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.    To assess the influence fathers might have on the risk of obesity early in childhood, researchers examined data from a nationally representative group of about 10,700 children born in 2001 who were followed until first grade, when kids are typically 6 to 7 years old.    All of the fathers lived at home with their kids in two-parent households but were not the primary caregivers. On average, fathers worked about 46 hours a week and mothers worked about 18 hours a week.    From ages 2 to 4, the proportion of children who were overweight decreased from about 14 percent to 8 percent. Over that same period, the proportion of kids who were obese declined from about 6 percent to 4 percent.    About one-quarter of fathers increased the amount of time they put into caregiving tasks and play time during the study period, while 30-40 percent decreased the amount of time they spent on these activities.    Even though some fathers got more involved in decision-making during the study, this didn’t appear to influence kids’ odds of obesity.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how fathers’ involvement with kids directly impacts children’s’ odds of obesity.    Other limitations include its reliance on fathers to accurately recall and report how much they did with their kids, the authors note in Obesity. Because the study only included two-parent households, the findings also might not apply to children living with only one caregiver.    “So, this study is telling us that when both parents are in the home, and regardless of how many hours each works outside the home, when fathers are more involved in caregiving responsibilities children are less likely to be obese,” Dr. Julie Lumeng, a researcher at the University of Michigan CS Mott Children’s Hospital in Ann Arbor who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Fathers’ involvement in playtime may have many benefits for kids, noted Philip Morgan, a researcher at the University of Newcastle in Australia who wasn’t involved in the study.    “When fathers take children outside to play, they both experience the benefits of physical activity, which reduces the risk of obesity,” Morgan said by email. “Indeed, being outside is beneficial as this form of leisure time activity usually displaces alternative unhealthy behaviors such as sitting in front of screens and/or eating poor quality foods.”   This doesn’t mean mothers or other adults can’t provide the same opportunity, however, said Dr. Stephen Daniels of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “Parents should be a team to ensure that kids get the proper diet and the best opportunities to be outdoors and engage in physical activity,” Daniels said by email. “However, it is important to emphasize that good lifestyle can also be developed in single parent families. Dads can clearly be helpful, especially in the area of physical activity, but this can also happen in other ways with other adult role models.”  "
2sQ06Am,2017-06-21,"Physician couple toilet-trains newborn, skips diapers"," (Reuters Health) - When two California doctors were expecting their third child, they wanted to stop contributing to the more than 27 billion disposable diapers dumped yearly into U.S. landfills.   But washing cloth diapers in water-starved Los Angeles wasn’t an environment-friendly alternative, either. Then Dr. Rosemary She read about a way to skip diapers altogether.    Called elimination communication, the method has parents and caregivers tune into a baby’s cues and natural rhythms and bring the child to a toilet when it seems like the right time.   Skeptical but determined to find a workable alternative to diapers, She gave it a try as soon as she brought her newborn daughter home from the hospital.   “I put her over a potty, gently held her legs, supported her belly, and she went,” she said in a phone interview. “It was kind of mind-blowing.”   She and her husband, Dr. Jeffrey Bender, extoll the benefits of going diaper-free in an editorial published today in Pediatrics. She is a pathologist at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. Bender is a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles.   “For young families interested in protecting the environment for future generations, who want to save some money and keep their kids healthy, this is a good option,” he told Reuters Health.     “It’s not for everyone, and we don’t want people to feel bad if they can’t do it,” he said. “We really want people to hear about it as an option.”   He would like pediatricians to spread the word about the benefits of going diaper-less.    Elimination communication not only spares the environment, it may stave off urinary tract infections and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, skin infections, Bender said. His practice is filled with cases of MRSA, and he tells parents that the best way to prevent MRSA abscesses is to get their children out of diapers.   Bender and She believe keeping babies’ bottoms bare also could improve parent-infant bonding, speed toilet training and make it easier for toddlers to walk unimpeded by bulky padding.   But Dr. Valerie Kimball, a professor at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, is not sold on the health benefits of elimination communication and sees no reason to introduce the subject with already overburdened parents in her pediatric practice, she said in a phone interview.   During her 14 years as a children’s doctor, Kimball has heard about infants going diaper-free from a handful of parents whose own parents or grandparents brought the practice from Asia and Eastern Europe.   She would endorse the technique but would only raise the subject with parents who told her they already were considering elimination communication, she said.   “I wouldn’t want to put this out there and have people feel guilty,” she said. “There are so many other things I’d rather have them worry about,” such as breastfeeding and providing their children with healthy food.   “There are a lot of pressures, and this would be one other pressure. If someone came to me and asked about it, I would say, ‘give it a try,’ but I don’t think I would necessarily recommend it,” she said.   Some of Bender’s patients’ parents and grandparents told him they learned about the practice in their home countries, El Salvador and Bangladesh, for example.    Before She seriously considered going diaper-free, her mother mentioned that in her native Taiwan in the 1940s, in the decade before disposal diapers came on the American market, a caretaker would hold an infant over a latrine, whistle, and the child would urinate.    “I thought that was the most ridiculous thing I ever heard, and I laughed at her,” She said. “And here I am really supporting this idea and this option for young parents.”   She and Bender took turns caring for their diaper-less daughter, who is now 5, and enjoyed competing over which one of them had fewer accidents.    But it would have been difficult for daycare providers to care for a baby without diapers. So when the couple returned to work, they hired a nanny.    They didn’t at first realize that the nanny had her own experience with elimination communication. After she started working for She and Bender, the nanny learned that her Taiwanese grandmother had cared for her without diapers as an infant, too.   "
2s9il2Z,2017-06-20,Coconut oil has more ‘bad’ fat than beef and butter: heart doctors," (Reuters Health) - Coconut oil raises ‘bad’ cholesterol in the same way as other foods high in saturated fats like butter and beef, according to the American Heart Association.    Indeed, butter and beef drippings have less saturated fat that raise levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), the bad kind of cholesterol that can build up in blood vessels and lead to clots and heart attacks, according to new AHA dietary recommendations. Coconut oil is 82 percent saturated fat, compared with 63 percent for butter and 50 percent for beef fat.    Instead of coconut oil, people should cook with so-called polyunsaturated fats like corn, soybean and peanut oils, the AHA advises.    “Replacing saturated with polyunsaturated has a two-fold effect because a fat that causes heart disease is lowered and a fat that prevents heart disease is increased,” lead author of the advisory Dr. Frank Sacks, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, said by email.    Coconut oil raised LDL about as much as other oils high in fat like butter, beef and palm oil in seven out of seven studies reviewed by the AHA for its advisory published in the journal Circulation.    Replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent, the AHA concludes from its review of trials that used the scientific gold standard for research - randomly assigning some participants to get the intervention being tested and others to receive an alternative or no treatment.   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 17.3 million fatalities a year, researchers note in the advisory.     Studies in many populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of cardiovascular disease.   For optimal heart health, the AHA recommends the Dietary Approaches To Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet or a Mediterranean-style diet. Both diets emphasize unsaturated vegetable oils, nuts, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, fish and poultry and both limit red meat, as well as foods and drinks high in added sugars and salt.   Even eating like this some of the time may help, said Dr. John Potter of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.    “Small changes may be relevant,” Potter, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    These might include cutting saturated fat with one meatless dinner a week, reducing sugar by eating one less cookie or drinking one less can of soda, having one less glass of alcohol or getting a few extra minutes of exercise every day, Potter suggested.    Portions also matter, said Dr. Lennert Veerman of the Cancer Council NSW in Sydney, Australia.   “Baking with coconut oil may not raise heart disease risks as much as, for example, a generous amount of butter on a 12-ounce steak, not to speak of the steak itself,” Veerman, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “But then again, a small reduction of risk every day adds up, so replacing coconut oil with olive oil may be an easy way to reduce risk a bit.”  "
2tqz3bK,2017-06-20,Combo of sleep apnea and insomnia linked to depression in men," (Reuters Health) - Men with both obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia are much more likely to have depression symptoms compared to men with either sleep disorder alone, suggests a recent Australian study.   The depression symptoms also seem to be worse for men who have both apnea and insomnia compared to men with depression but without this combination of sleep problems, the authors report in the journal Respirology.    “Obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia are the two most common sleep disorders and can occur together in the same individual,” lead author Dr. Carol Lang, a researcher at the Basil Hetzel Institute at the University of Adelaide Queen Elizabeth Hospital Campus, told Reuters Health.   “We know that each of these disorders is individually associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes in patients. However, we don’t know very much about if, or how, the two disorders interact with each other and the health outcomes when they coexist in the same individual,” Lang said in an email.   A person with obstructive sleep apnea has their breathing interrupted multiple times during sleep by narrowed or blocked airways. The condition is often treated by wearing a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, mask to keep the airway open.   Insomnia was defined in this study as the inability to fall or stay asleep together with feeling fatigued during the day.    Lang and her colleagues enrolled 700 mostly middle aged men in Adelaide with no diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. All of them underwent at-home sleep monitoring known as polysomnography and answered questions about their sleep habits, health conditions and possible depression symptoms.    Researchers found that more than half of the men had undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. In the entire group, 323 men had sleep apnea only, 37 had insomnia only and 47 had both conditions.    Of the men with both sleep apnea and insomnia, 43 percent also had depression, compared with 22 percent of the men who had insomnia alone and 8 percent of the men who had sleep apnea alone.    Sleep deprivation, which may occur in chronic insomnia, is known to adversely affect muscles involved in breathing and may contribute to the propensity and severity of sleep apnea, Lang noted.   “There are also many biochemical signaling pathways in the body through which sleep apnea, insomnia, and depression may interact with each other,” she said.   If one of the sleep disorders is suspected, primary care providers should consider the possibility of co-existing sleep apnea and insomnia as well as their patient’s mental health, said Lang.   “Since some hypnotic medications could potentially be counter-productive, patients should be referred to sleep clinics, and if necessary mental health clinics, for further investigation so that the most appropriate treatment strategy can be implemented for them as an individual,” she said.   Our sleep is important for our physical and mental health, Lang added, and a person who experiences sleep problems should talk to a medical practitioner to see if further investigation is necessary.

2sinXYE,2017-06-19,"Nearly 1,300 U.S. kids die from gunshot wounds each year"," (Reuters Health) - Firearms kill almost 1,300 American youngsters each year, and boys and black children are most often the victims, a U.S. study finds.    During the 13-year study, more than half of the gun-related deaths were homicides, while 38 percent were suicides and 6 percent were fatalities from accidental gun injuries, researchers report in Pediatrics.    Each year, guns seriously wounded about 5,800 additional kids under 18.    “Firearm injuries are a leading cause of death among U.S. children aged 1 to 17 years and contribute substantially each year to premature death, illness and disability of children,” said lead study author Katherine Fowler of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta.    “About 19 children a day die or are medically treated in an emergency department for a gunshot wound in the U.S.,” Fowler said by email.    Although accidental firearm deaths among children declined from 2002 to 2014 and gun-related homicides decreased from 2007 to 2014, suicides surged 60 percent from 2007 to 2014, the analysis of national injury records found.    Boys account for 82 percent of all child firearm deaths, and black children have the highest rates of firearm mortality overall due to much higher firearm homicide rates. About four black children out of every 100,000 die from gunshot homicides, ten times higher than the rate for white, Asian or Pacific Islander kids, the study found.   “It is important to note that firearm injuries and especially deaths are typically not isolated events,” said Alex Piquero, a criminology researcher at the University of Texas at Dallas who wasn’t involved in the study.   “They often tend to co-occur with other crimes, whether gang-related, drug involved or other serious criminal activities, and for many of these crimes boys tend to be overrepresented compared to girls,” Piquero said by email. “Crime – especially violence, poverty and related adverse contextual circumstances – are unfortunate characteristics that are common to inner city areas that are overrepresented by minority residents.”   For younger children, homicides often occurred in the context of domestic violence, a conflict between intimate partners or other family members. Among older kids, homicides typically happened during disputes with their peers, the study also found.   Suicides often occurred in the context of stressful circumstances or relationship problems with a boyfriend, girlfriend or family member. White children, American Indian and Native Alaskan children were four to five times more likely to die by suicide than other kids.    If kids didn’t have guns, the impulse to kill themselves might pass before they acted on it, said Dr. Eliot Nelson, author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at the University of Vermont Children’s Hospital in Burlington.    “Too many people assume that if (youngsters) didn’t have a gun they’d use something else, but the quick lethality of guns makes them especially dangerous for an impulsive teen whose moment of crisis might pass with a little time,” Nelson said by email.    “Other methods are harder to use or more likely to be survivable, such as an overdose,” Nelson added.    Accidental gun deaths, meanwhile, almost always happened in the context of children playing with firearms.    All gun deaths and injuries are preventable, experts say.    “Children are curious, and research tells us that they know more about the location of guns in the home than parents might assume,” said Dr. Ruth Abaya of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.    “Simply instructing kids about safe handling is not sufficiently protective,” Abaya, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. Guns ideally should be stored outside the home, she said, but if they are in the home they should be unloaded, locked, and in a gun safe.    Parents also shouldn’t underestimate how witnessing gun violence influences kids, said Joan Reid, a researcher at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Living in communities marred by violence that seems to be inevitable and unavoidable, some come to view gun carrying as a defensive strategy, adopting the belief that gun carrying can keep them safer,” Reid said by email. “However, we know that carrying a gun increases the likelihood of youth being injured or dying by gun violence.”  "
2qvRTRX,2017-06-19,"Mindfulness-based childbirth classes may ease pain, depression"," (Reuters Health) - When birthing classes include mindfulness-based education instead of focusing only on the biology of having a baby, women may have an easier time coping with labor pain and a lower risk of postpartum depression, a small experiment suggests.    Fear of childbirth is linked with lower tolerance for labor pain and higher odds of postpartum depression, researchers note in BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth. For the current study, they randomly assigned 30 mothers to receive either traditional or mindfulness-based birth classes during their last trimester of pregnancy.    There wasn’t a meaningful difference between the groups in perceived labor pain or use of epidurals, the study found. But women who went through the mindfulness-based birthing classes appeared to have greater body awareness during labor and lower odds of depression after their babies arrived.    “In the mindfulness-based childbirth classes, the emphasis is on purposefully cultivating the life skill of mindfulness - the awareness that arises from paying attention, on purpose and non-judgmentally to whatever is arising moment by moment - whether it’s the stress of a job, a fearful thought about the future, the physical pain of labor, or a crying baby,” said senior study author Nancy Bardacke, a certified nurse-midwife at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.    “It is also a skill that helps expectant parents manage the reality that the future - whether it is childbirth or life - is both unknown and unpredictable,” Bardacke said by email.   All of the women in the study were first-time mothers. Half of them were assigned to a standard childbirth preparation class that reviewed factual information about birth like the stages of labor and what to expect after the baby arrives.    The other women attended an intensive weekend workshop that included standard childbirth preparation topics but also focused on practices like mindful movement, walking meditation, and pain coping strategies. These women also received handouts and guided audio materials so they could practice mindfulness on their own.    While mothers in the mindfulness group sought epidurals at similar rates to those in the control group and afterward reported similar levels of pain during labor, the study did see a trend toward lower use of opioid-based pain medication during labor.    While these results were too small to rule out the possibility that they were due to chance, about 62 percent of women in the standard education group used narcotics during labor compared to 31 percent in the mindfulness group.    “Many women in the mindfulness group used the skills to avoid pain medication in early labor and then opted for epidural when things became more intense, but as a more intentional, mindful choice, versus out of fear of the bodily sensations of labor,” said lead study author Larissa Duncan of the University of Wisconsin-Madison.    “If a woman intends to avoid epidural, it is possible these skills might permit her to do so,” Duncan said by email.    Women in the mindfulness group also reported fewer symptoms of depression in assessments after birth and six week later than women who went through the standard childbirth education course.    Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include a high rate of epidural use in both groups that made it hard to discern meaningful differences in how women perceived pain, the authors note. Researchers also lacked data on the duration of labor, a factor that could influence epidural use because this is more common with longer birthing processes.   "
2tlqWyc,2017-06-19,Yoga as good for low back pain as physical therapy," (Reuters Health) - Chronic lower back pain is equally likely to improve with yoga classes as with physical therapy, according to a new study.   Twelve weeks of yoga lessened pain and improved function in people with low back pain as much as physical therapy sessions over the same period.   “Both yoga and physical therapy are excellent non-drug approaches for low back pain,” said lead author Dr. Robert Saper, of Boston Medical Center.   About 10 percent of U.S. adults experience low back pain, but not many are happy with the available treatments, Saper and colleagues write in the Annals of Internal Medicine.    The American College of Physicians advised in February that most people with low back pain should try non-drug treatments like superficial heat or massage before reaching for medications ( reut.rs/2strnGw ).   Physical therapy is the most common non-drug treatment for low back pain prescribed by doctors, according to Saper and colleagues. Yoga is also backed by some guidelines and studies as a treatment option, but until now no research has compared the two.   For the new study, the researchers recruited 320 adults with chronic low back pain. The participants were racially diverse and tended to have low incomes.   The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups. One group took part in a 12-week yoga program designed for people with low back pain. Another took part in a physical therapy program over the same amount of time. People in the third group received a book with comprehensive information about low back pain and follow-up information every few weeks.   At the start of the study, participants reported - on average - moderate to severe functional impairment and pain. More than two-thirds were using pain medications.   To track participants function and pain during the study, the researchers surveyed them at six, 12, 26, 40 and 52 weeks using the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ).    Scores on the RMDQ measure for function declined - meaning function was improving - by 3.8 points over the 12 weeks in the yoga group, compared to 3.5 points in the physical therapy group. Participants who received education had an average RMDQ score decline of 2.5.   Statistically, participants ended up with similar functional improvements whether they underwent yoga, physical therapy or education.   More people in the yoga and physical therapy groups ended up with noticeable improvements in function, however.   People would feel a noticeable improvement with a four to five point drop on the RMDQ, write Dr. Douglas Chang, of the University of California, San Diego and Dr. Stefan Kertesz of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in an accompanying editorial.   They write that 48 percent of yoga participants and 37 percent of physical therapy participants reached that goal, compared to 23 percent of people who were in the education group.   For achieving noticeable differences in pain, physical therapy was again no better or worse than yoga. After 12 weeks, people in the yoga group were 21 percentage points less likely to used pain medications than those in the education group. That difference was 22 percentage points for physical therapy versus education.   The improvements among the people in yoga and physical therapy groups lasted throughout the year, the researchers found.   “If they remain the same after one year, it’s a good bet that their improvement will continue on,” Saper told Reuters Health.   One treatment method won’t help all or even most patients, wrote Chang and Kertesz in their editorial.   “Nevertheless, as Saper and colleagues have shown, yoga offers some persons tangible benefit without much risk,” they write. “In the end, however, it represents one tool among many.”  "
2rEruRA,2017-06-16,"Worldwide, more than 10 percent of young teens are smokers"," (Reuters Health) - Roughly 11 percent of youth aged 13 to 15 around the world use tobacco products like cigarettes and cigars, a global survey of students suggests.                     Cigarettes are seen in this illustration photo taken May 24, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration      Tobacco use is the world’s leading cause of preventable death and serious illness, killing an estimated 6 million people each year, researchers note in the youth tobacco report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most smokers take up the habit in their teens.    For the current study, researchers examined data from surveys of teens in 61 countries conducted from 2012 to 2015. Half of nations had a smoking rate of at least 15 percent for boys and at least 8 percent for girls, they found.    “Smoking has been shown to harm nearly every organ of the body, and science shows that most adult smokers first start smoking during adolescence,” said lead study author Rene Arrazola of the Office on Smoking and Health at the CDC.   “Young people who begin to smoke at an earlier age are more likely than those who start at older ages to develop long-term nicotine addiction,” Arrazola said by email. “Therefore, efforts to prevent youth tobacco use are critical to prevent another generation of adults who smoke and suffer from smoking-related death and disease.”   Across all of the countries in the study, the lowest prevalence of teen smoking (1.7 percent) was seen in Sri Lanka. The highest prevalence (35 percent) was in Timor-Leste.    For boys, the lowest smoking prevalence was 2.9 percent in Tajikistan and the highest was 61.4 percent in Timor-Leste. For girls, the lowest rate - 1.6 percent – was seen in Tajikistan and the highest - 29 percent - in Bulgaria.   In the majority of countries, at least half of current tobacco smokers said they wanted to quit, the study also found. The proportion of student smokers who said they desired to quit ranged from a low of 32 percent in Uruguay to a high of 90 percent in the Philippines.   Limitations of the study include the reliance on teens to accurately recall and report on their smoking behavior, the authors note. It also only included students enrolled in school, which might not fully represent smoking behavior in these countries.    “I was surprised to see that most of the countries were in the 10 to 20 percent range; I would have thought the numbers would be higher, but they either are similar or slightly higher than rates in the U.S. which are around 10 to 15 percent,” said Dr. Maher Karam-Hage, associate medical director of the tobacco treatment program at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas.    A variety of policies at the country level can influence whether young teens will smoke, Karam-Hage, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “Cultural values and norms in their individual countries are most critical, followed by the economic factors (prices and taxes), age restrictions and policies such as whether they have clean indoor air (laws) or not,” Karam-Hage said.

2rEDAGA,2017-06-16,Nonprescription prenatal vitamins may be more potent," (Reuters Health) - Prescription prenatal vitamins may have lower doses of key ingredients like vitamin A, vitamin D, and calcium than nonprescription alternatives, a recent study suggests.                     A woman holds her stomach at the last stages of her pregnancy in Bordeaux April 28, 2010.  REUTERS/Regis Duvignau          Even though prenatal vitamins are widely recommended to pregnant women to help meet the nutrient needs for mothers and babies, women may struggle to choose the right supplement because labeling is inconsistent and the amount of the active ingredients varies widely from one product to the next, researchers note in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.        There’s no single right choice, experts say.        Pregnant women should discuss their diet with their doctor before choosing a supplement, and try as much as possible to get needed nutrients from the foods they eat during pregnancy, said Deborah O’Connor, a nutrition researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the new research.       For the study, investigators examined labeling for 82 prescription and 132 nonprescription products in the U.S. They looked for doses of seven vitamins and minerals, non-nutrient ingredients, and safety information.        Overall, prescription products had higher amounts of folic acid, which helps prevent brain and spinal cord birth defects, the study found.        Prescription supplements typically had fewer vitamins – 9 compared with 11 for nonprescription options – and fewer minerals – 4 compared with 8 for nonprescription products.        “They can vary substantially in their nutrient content,” said lead study author Dr. Leila Saldanha, of the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health.       “Generally, most provide the amounts of nutrients that are recommended during pregnancy,” Saldanha said by email. “Overall, however, prescription prenatals are less potent than nonprescription prenatals, except for folic acid.”       Both types of supplements had similar amounts of zinc, iron and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid in fish oil that can support healthy development of a baby’s brain, nervous system and eyes, the study also found.        All of the vitamins had higher than the recommended dose of at least one nutrient, based on U.S. dietary guidelines for pregnant and lactating women.        About 33 percent of the nonprescription products contained botanical ingredients, compared with 6 percent of prescription prenatals. Nonprescription products were also more likely to contain probiotics, although only 8 percent did, compared with 2 percent of prescription alternatives.        Only prescription products contained the stool softener docusate sodium.       One limitation of the study is that researchers looked just at the declared amount on labels, and not at data on the actual amounts found in analysis of the supplements, the authors note.        For some women, insurance benefits and costs may influence what supplement they choose, because prescription products may come with lower out-of-pocket costs, O’Connor pointed out in an email.        Whatever they choose, women should try to avoid taking supplements that contain doses of vitamins and minerals that are higher than the recommended maximum amounts for pregnant women, she said.        Also, she advises, women should consume a varied diet higher in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, low- or non-fat dairy, seafood, legumes and nuts, “and I would suggest that they lower their intake of red and processed meats and limit sugar-sweetened beverages and refined grains.”        When they follow this advice, they may still need supplements, though.       “Even if their diet is a healthy one, I still recommend, as do most professional organizations, that women planning a pregnancy consume a 400 ug folic acid containing multivitamin supplement,” O’Connor said.       "
2sALcOS,2017-06-16,More liver cancer deaths could be averted in the U.S," (Reuters Health) - - Death rates from liver cancer in the U.S. have doubled since the 1980s and continue to rise, largely due to risk factors like hepatitis that should be the focus of better treatment and prevention efforts, researchers say.   Despite improved survival rates overall, the rise in new diagnoses of liver cancer means that death rates are still increasing faster than for any other cancer type, the study team writes in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.   	“Liver cancer is one of the few cancers for which death rates are increasing, even though many of the risk factors for the disease are avoidable or treatable. It also continues to be one of the most fatal cancers, with only about 1 in 5 patients surviving 5 years after diagnosis,” study author Kimberly Miller told Reuters Health by email.   “Large racial and socioeconomic disparities in liver cancer death rates still exist, reflecting differences in the prevalence of risk factors and, to some extent, inequalities in access to high quality care,” added Miller, an epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society in Atlanta.   The researchers examined nationwide data on incidence, mortality and survival rates for cancers of the liver and bile duct between the years 1990 and 2012, and focused on differences in these categories by region, race or ethnicity.    Rates of death from liver cancers ranged from 5.5 per 100,000 population in non-Hispanic whites to 11.9 per 100,000 in American Indians/Alaska Natives, the study found.    The lowest death rates were in North Dakota, at 3.8 per 100,000, and the highest were in the District of Columbia with 9.6 per 100,000.   “The rise in rates of new liver cancer cases has been largely driven by the higher hepatitis C virus prevalence among baby boomers (those born between 1945 and 1965),” Miller noted. “However, the obesity epidemic and rising diabetes prevalence among the general population have also likely contributed.”   Death rates are rising because liver cancer continues to be a highly fatal disease, she said.    Racial disparities in liver cancer rates are largely driven by differences in risk factor prevalence, but also in part by healthcare inequalities, she added.   “For example, while some risk factors (like hepatitis B and C virus infections) can be treated, these treatments are not always affordable for the populations that are most likely to be affected.”   It is particularly striking that while a similar proportion of liver cancer cases are diagnosed at an early stage among blacks and whites, overall liver cancer survival is notably lower in blacks, who have been shown in studies to be much less likely to receive surgical treatment and liver transplantation for early stage disease, even when they are eligible, Miller said.   In addition to chronic hepatitis B or C virus infection, factors that increase liver cancer risk include cigarette smoking, metabolic disorders (such as type 2 diabetes and obesity), and heavy alcohol use, she said.   “Many of these risk factors are avoidable or treatable. It is important to be aware of what your risk factors are and to talk to your health care provider about what you can do to lower your risk.”   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends one-time hepatitis C virus testing for those who were born between 1945 and 1965, but only 14 percent of baby boomers have been tested, Miller noted.   “I agree and support most of the result and the conclusion,” said Dr. Ping Gu, an oncologist at NYU Langone Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York who wasn’t involved in the study.    Gu, who sees a diverse population of patients, says he saw a least 50 liver cancer patients last year. Hepatitis B is the main cause of liver cancer for the Asian population, he added.   As far as prevention, hepatitis B vaccinations are extremely helpful, and tougher screening tests on blood donations have virtually eliminated the risk of hepatitis C from transfusions, Gu said.   Another preventable risk factor is obesity, which Gu said he sees “more and more” among Hispanic patients, and smoking, which is still too common in Asian communities. “I would say in Asian population, especially in Japan, Korea, and the Chinese, the male smoking rate is very high,” he said.

2sfVbGH,2017-06-15,Footage shows Oakland police less respectful to blacks than whites," (Reuters Health) - Body-camera footage from Oakland, California police officers shows the officers spoke more respectfully to white drivers than black drivers during routine traffic stops, researchers say.   The study, the first systematic analysis of police body-camera footage, found subtle but widespread racial disparities in officers’ language.   “Our findings highlight that, on the whole, police interactions with black community members are more fraught than their interactions with white community members,” said Jennifer Eberhardt, co-author of the study and professor of psychology at Stanford University in California, in a press release.   “Words are power,” Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said in a statement. “And this study shows that the words police officers use are consequential.”    She pledged to work to end racial differences in Oakland policing.   Transcripts of 981 stops conducted by 245 Oakland officers in April 2014 showed that police were more likely to call white drivers “sir,” or “ma’am,” or to address them by a courtesy title and their last name, while officers were more likely to address black drivers by their first name or call them “bro,” “dude” or “bud.”    The racial disparities persisted even after researchers controlled for the race of the officer, the location and the outcome of the stop and the severity of the infraction.   Officers were 57 percent more likely to offer an apology, to thank or otherwise speak in what is considered a respectful way to white drivers than blacks, according to the report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.   On the other hand, officers were 61 percent more likely to address black residents less respectfully; for example, they were more likely to order blacks to keep their hands on the wheel.   “To be clear: There was no swearing,” Dan Jurafsky, a study co-author and Stanford professor of linguistics and of computer science, said in a statement. “These were well-behaved officers. But the many small differences in how they spoke with community members added up to pervasive racial disparities.”   The Oakland police department is the nation’s first law-enforcement agency to allow a university to examine body-worn camera footage of vehicle stops. The racially diverse Bay Area city of about 420,000 was a pioneer of police body cameras in 2010.    Supporters of police body cameras, worn now in major cities throughout the U.S, say the footage can help avert or resolve cases of police misconduct.    Lead author Rob Voigt, a Stanford linguistics doctoral student, told Reuters Health in an email that the study shows the footage also offers possible insight into everyday police-community relations.   “Police departments can use these tools not only to diagnose problems in police-community relations but also to develop solutions,” he said.   “Although this study focuses on traffic stops, the findings speak to a known issue about policing and racial bias,” said Dr. Gary Slutkin, founder of Cure Violence at the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health.   “Everyone has biases, but because police have so much power over citizens, including to arrest, charge and even use a gun, these biases do cause harm,” Slutkin, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.   Every routine traffic stop is “an opportunity to build or erode public trust in the police,” the study authors write.    Without knowing the race or gender of the officers or the stopped motorists, 70 undergraduate students rated officers’ transcribed utterances based on their level of respect, politeness and friendliness.   Researchers then created a computational linguistic model of how speakers show respect, including apologies and commands, and designed software to identify words and phrases in the body-camera footage transcripts. Investigators employed the software to examine the remaining transcripts.    “The racial disparities in officer respect are clear and consistent, yet the causes of these disparities are less clear,” the authors write.   “It is certainly possible that some of these disparities are prompted by the language and behavior of the community members themselves, particularly as historical tensions in Oakland and preexisting beliefs about the legitimacy of the police may induce fear, anger, or stereotype threat,” they write. “However, community member speech cannot be the sole cause of these disparities.”   Police encounters tend to be stressful, and the study highlights the need for community interventions, like mental health and substance-abuse prevention programs, to try to reduce residents’ encounters with law enforcement, Slutkin said.

2sEmX20,2017-06-16,Exercise may stave off postpartum depression," (Reuters Health) - - Physical activity during and after pregnancy improves psychological wellbeing and may protect against postpartum depression, according to a new analysis of existing research.   Even low-intensity exercise, such as walking with a baby stroller, was linked to a lower likelihood of depressive symptoms in new mothers, researchers found.   “The negative consequences of postpartum depression not only affect the mother but also the child, who can suffer poor emotional and cognitive development,” said study co-author Celia Alvarez-Bueno of the University of Castilla-La Mancha in Cuenca, Spain.   Postpartum depression, the most common complication of bearing a child, affects 1 in 9 women, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms can include anxiety attacks, insecurity, irritability, fatigue, guilt, fear of harming the baby and a reluctance to breastfeed.    The symptoms start within four weeks of delivery and are considered severe when they last for more than two weeks, the study team writes in the journal Birth.   “That’s why it’s important to test the most effective strategies to prevent this disorder or mitigate the consequences,” Alvarez-Bueno told Reuters Health by email.   The study team analyzed data from 12 controlled trials of exercise interventions during or after pregnancy between 1990 and 2016 that addressed the effects of physical activity on postpartum depression. The studies included a total of 932 women and all examined the severity of postpartum depression as well as including basic information about the length, frequency, type and intensity of the exercise.   The exercises used in the various studies included stretching and breathing, walking programs, aerobic activity, Pilates and yoga.   Compared to women who didn’t exercise, those who did had lower scores on depression symptom tests during the postpartum period, the researchers found. The apparent benefit of having fewer depression symptoms was seen even among women who did not meet the cutoff for a depression diagnosis.   “We expected that physical activity could reduce postpartum depressive symptoms,” Alvarez-Bueno said. “However, we were pleasantly surprised when we found that exercise after pregnancy also reduced depression among the women who didn’t have diagnosable symptoms.”   Most intervention programs lasted for three months or longer and recommended three to five exercise sessions per week, but the current study didn’t draw conclusions or provide recommendations about the type or length of exercise that would be most beneficial.   The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommended in 2009 that pregnant and postpartum women engage in 30 minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week.    “We know that exercise is just as effective as anti-depressants for adults. The trick is to get them to do the physical activity,” said Beth Lewis of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, who wasn’t involved with the study.   “With postpartum depression, it’s even more complicated due to the increased stress and sleep deprivation after having a baby,” she told Reuters Health. “We’re starting to learn more about exercise and how it helps.”   Future studies should include more data about the types of physical activity programs that could reduce depression, the study authors write. Health providers should know more about the duration, intensity and frequency of exercise to recommend to new mothers, Alvarez-Bueno noted.   “It remains unanswered how these characteristics improve postpartum depression prevention,” she said. “More research addressing this issue is urgently necessary because of the influence on both the mother and child.”   Lewis and colleagues are conducting a randomized trial that analyzes home-based exercise and home-based wellness programs among 450 mothers with a history of depression. In another study, they’re analyzing exercise programs among low-income women at risk for postpartum depression.   “Exercise is often the first thing that gets crossed off the list when there’s a new baby,” Lewis said. “It’s important to take care of yourself through exercise to keep that wellbeing high.”  "
2rIM4zI,2017-06-15,Many rape victims experience &#039;paralysis&#039; during assault," (Reuters Health) - Many sexual assault victims experience an involuntary inability to move during rape, and those who do are more likely to later develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, Swedish researchers say.   In a large sample of women treated at a rape clinic in Stockholm, about 70 percent reported an inability to move or resist during the assault.   “Victims tend to blame themselves for not resisting, so the fact that 7 out of 10 have paralysis is useful to know,” said lead study author Dr. Anna Moller of Stockholm South General Hospital and the Karolinska Institute.    In animals, this reaction, known as tonic immobility is an evolutionary defensive response to a predatory attack, Moller’s team writes in the journal Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica.    Past studies indicate that humans can similarly feel paralyzed when under attack or in other life-threatening circumstances, experiencing temporary, involuntary immobility that may also involve a dissociated, catatonic-like mental state.   “In court situations, a lot of focus is given to whether the victim consented to the intercourse or not,” Moller told Reuters Health by email. “This paralysis and passiveness should not be considered consent.”   Moller and colleagues surveyed 298 women who visited the Emergency Clinic for Raped Women in Stockholm within one month of a sexual assault. The clinic offers free services and sees about 600 patients per year. The researchers interviewed participants using a questionnaire called the Tonic Immobility Scale, which asks about feeling frozen or paralyzed, the inability to move although not restrained, the inability to call out or shout, numbness, feeling cold and feeling detached from one’s self.    After six months, the research team also assessed 189 of those women for PTSD and depression.   They found that 70 percent of women reported significant tonic immobility and 48 percent reported extreme tonic immobility during their assaults. Having had this experience more than doubled the likelihood of PTSD at the six-month follow up and raised the likelihood of severe depression by nearly four-fold.   Of the 189 women who completed the six-month assessment, more than half of those who experienced tonic immobility during their assault had developed PTSD, compared to 28 percent who didn’t. Similarly, 34 percent of those who experienced tonic immobility were severely depressed, compared to 14 percent of those who didn’t.    The research team also found that women with a history of sexual assault - in childhood or adulthood - were twice as likely as others to have experienced tonic immobility during the recent rape. Women whose rape was part of a “more severe assault,” involving physical violence or multiple attackers, for example, were also twice as likely to have experienced tonic immobility during the attack.   One limitation of the study is that the emergency clinic only saw female patients at the time of the interviews. Moller’s team would also like to include larger, more diverse samples in several geographic locations to better understand tonic immobility generally, she said.   Future studies should also include levels of victim resistance, said Jennifer Wong of Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, who wasn’t involved in the research.    “A victim may have felt frozen, detached or numb during some of the assault but may have initially verbally or physically resisted her attacker,” Wong said.   Tonic immobility research could provide major implications for court cases and the psycho-education of rape victims, Moller said.   “Don’t blame rape victims for not resisting,” she said. “It’s a normal biological reaction when exposed to an extreme threat.”   "
2rUl2Ul,2017-06-14,Snus linked to asthma and sleep problems," (Reuters Health) - Snus, a moist, smokeless tobacco product, may contribute to breathing and sleep problems, Swedish researchers report.   Based on questionnaires answered by more than 16,000 never-smokers in Sweden, researchers found that snus users were over 50 percent more likely than non-users to have asthma. In addition, snus users were 37 to 59 percent more likely to snore and have trouble falling asleep, the study found.    Snus, which was developed in Sweden, usually comes in a small pouch and users tuck a pinch of it between the gums and upper lip.    “Snus is used by a large proportion of especially young and middle-aged men in Sweden,” said senior study author Dr. Christer Janson of the University of Uppsala.   “There are some studies showing association between the use of snus and heart disease but to my knowledge no studies on the possible effects of snus on the respiratory system,” Janson said by email.   Janson said someone on his staff told him her husband’s asthma had improved when he stopped using snus. “Then a young Icelandic doctor, Arna Yr Gudnadottir, contacted me and wanted to do some research here in Uppsala,” he said.   Gudnadottir, Janson, and their colleagues examined data taken from a questionnaire that was mailed to 45,000 randomly selected Swedish residents as part of the Global Allergy and Asthma European Network survey in 2008.    Nearly 27,000 people, ranging in age from 16 to 75, responded. They lived in one of four Swedish cities: Uppsala, Stockholm, Ume or Gothenburg.   Of this entire study group, 16,082 people were never-smokers and roughly 18 percent of men and 5 percent of women used snus. Overall, younger people were more likely to be dual users of snus and smoked tobacco, while older people were more likely to smoke than to use snus, according to the report in BMJ Open.   All in all, participants who reported having any respiratory symptoms were more likely to be smokers and dual users of cigarettes and snus. However, snus users were more likely to suffer from wheezing and night-time chest tightness, chronic bronchitis, and chronic nose and sinus problems, when compared with participants who were completely tobacco-free.    The study team also found that people who reported having asthma were more likely to be current snus users and the same link wasn’t seen among past snus users, dual users or people who only smoked.     “My guess is that the finding between a higher risk of asthma in snus users is related to inflammation in the upper part of the airways. This inflammation can then expand to the lower parts of the airways and thereby cause asthma,” Janson said.   The theory is supported by the fact that rhinitis, or inflammation in the nose, increases the risk of developing asthma, Janson said.   The researchers acknowledge that these associations don’t prove that snus cause asthma.    “We will start a follow-up study of this population next year. We can then get more precise information on what happens to participants that start or quit using snus,” Janson said.   The study reports some novel findings, and the sample is quite impressive, said Lucy Popova, of the Georgia State University School of Public Health in Atlanta who was not involved in the research.   However, she added, “As the authors themselves acknowledge, it could be that snus causes asthma and other problems, or it could be that people with asthma are more likely to use snus than smoke (or to not use snus).”   Popova noted that less than 1 percent of U.S. adults use snus every day or some days and that Swedish snus is less harmful than the traditional smokeless tobacco (moist snuff, also called chew or dip) sold in the U.S.   “Swedish snus has a lower concentration of cancer-causing chemicals called ‘tobacco-specific nitrosamines’ or TSNAs that naturally occur in tobacco plants and increase during the fermentation of tobacco leaves, Popova said by email.   “While snus is not risk-free, if used exclusively, snus is safer than smoking,” she said.

2r4cn1g,2017-06-15,One third of U.S. adults don’t know e-cigarette vapor may harm kids," (Reuters Health) - Even though the U.S. Surgeon General has concluded e-cigarette vapor may expose children to nicotine and other harmful chemicals, a new study finds that one in three adults aren’t sure if the devices are dangerous to use around kids.                     A man smokes an electronic cigarette vaporizer, also known as an e-cigarette, in Toronto, August 7, 2015.  REUTERS/Mark Blinch       Big U.S. tobacco companies are all developing e-cigarettes, battery-powered gadgets with a heating element that turns liquid nicotine and flavorings into a cloud of vapor that users inhale.  Some previous research suggests vapor from e-cigarettes may be less toxic than traditional cigarette smoke, but the electronic alternatives still release chemicals that aren’t normally in the air and the long-term health effects of the ingredients and flavorings in e-cigarettes are unclear.    Overall, just 5.3 percent of adults who participated in a 2015 online survey thought exposure to secondhand e-cigarette vapor caused “no harm” to kids, the study from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. Another 40 percent of adults thought it caused “little harm” or “some harm” to children.    “The bottom line is that kids should not be exposed to the emissions from any type of tobacco product, irrespective of whether that product is smoked, smokeless or electronic,” said senior study author Brian King, a researcher with the CDC Office on Smoking and Health in Atlanta.    “Although e-cigarette aerosol generally contains less harmful ingredients than secondhand smoke, it is not harmless; safer is not the same thing as safe,” King said by email. “It’s important for users of these products, particularly parents, to know the dangers of secondhand exposure to e-cigarette aerosol and to protect kids from this preventable health risk.”   To assess how adults thought about the risk of exposing kids to e-cigarettes, CDC researchers examined data from a survey of 4,127 adults 18 or older. The survey asked people to consider the potential harms of all electronic vapor products including e-cigarettes as well as e-hookahs, hookah pens, vape pens and e-cigars.    Current e-cigarette users were almost 18 times more likely than people who never tried the devices to think the secondhand vapors caused no harm to children, and former e-cigarette users were more than seven times more likely to have this opinion, according to the results published in the CDC journal Preventing Chronic Disease.    Compared with people who never smoked traditional cigarettes, current smokers were more than four times more likely to consider secondhand e-cigarette vapor harmless for kids, and former smokers were about twice as likely to have this opinion, the study found.    Men were more than twice as likely as women to think secondhand e-cigarette fumes were harmless for kids.   Adults aged 45 to 64 were less likely to be uncertain about the risk of exposing kids to second-hand e-cigarette smoke than younger adults aged 18 to 24, the study also found.    One limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t have detailed data to determine how often current or former e-cigarette users and cigarette smokers had used these products, the authors note. That means responses from heavy users were included in the same categories as people who only smoked or vaped occasionally.    Still, the findings underscore the need to raise awareness about the potential harms as researchers continue to investigate the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes, said Dr. Alexander Prokhorov, director of the tobacco outreach education program at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.    “The products simply have not been in existence long enough to investigate their long-term effects,” Prokhorov, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “It took us decades to fully understand the devastating consequences of conventional cigarettes and we are regularly discovering more and more illnesses and disorders attributable to active and passive smoking,” Prokhorov said. “I would not be surprised if ongoing studies will soon report additional facts on first- and second-hand vaping and health.”  "
2sXLJaU,2017-06-14,Untreated sleep apnea may worsen markers of heart health and diabetes," (Reuters Health) - - Properly treating a common sleep-related breathing disorder may have benefits for the heart and for blood sugar, a new study suggests.   If people with obstructive sleep apnea don’t use machines at night to help keep the airway open, measures of their heart health and blood sugar worsen, researchers found.   “One of the longstanding debates in our field” is whether sleep apnea actually causes heart issues and problems with blood sugar, “or if they’re just associated,” said senior author Dr. Jonathan Jun, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.	           In obstructive sleep apnea, the airway intermittently collapses or becomes blocked during sleep. The blocked airway causes pauses in breathing.   In the past, researchers have tried to find a direct link between sleep apnea, heart health and blood sugar by comparing patients instructed to use CPAP machines at night to keep the airway open with patients who were instructed to sleep without using these machines. But one of the major issues with those studies is that people may not actually use the CPAP machine, Jun told Reuters Health by phone.   For the new study, the researchers recruited 31 people with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea who were known to regularly use their CPAP machines.   The participants slept two nights in the lab, using their CPAP on only one of the nights. The researchers obtained blood samples while participants slept.   “We are looking at real time changes,” said Jun. “We’re getting blood every 20 minutes.”   As reported in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, on the night without CPAP, patients’ obstructive sleep apnea returned. On those nights, patients had low levels of oxygen in their blood, poor sleep and an increased heart rate.   Additionally, their blood samples showed increases in fatty acids, sugar and a stress hormone known as cortisol.   The researchers also saw increases in blood pressure and in arterial stiffness, which has been linked with a risk for heart problems.   “These were obese patients and patients with relatively severe sleep apnea. They also had other medical problems,” Jun pointed out. People who fit that description may be experiencing the same changes during the night if they sleep without their CPAP machine, he said.   Glucose and fatty acids rose in the overall group without the CPAP machines, but participants with diabetes may be more vulnerable to the glucose elevation, Jun warned.   He said the study can’t say what would happen to people with milder sleep apnea.   Because obesity has been tied to an increased risk of sleep apnea, it’s been difficult to know if it’s the sleep apnea or the obesity itself that’s causing those problems, Jun noted.    The new study, he said, “advances that idea that other conditions and not obesity itself are driver of those levels.”  "
2spiqRl,2017-06-13,Mammogram follow-up tests take longer for Asian women in U.S.," (Reuters Health) - After an abnormal mammogram, Asian women in the U.S. are less likely than white women to get follow-up tests to determine if they have breast cancer, a recent study suggests.   Researchers examined data on 50,970 women with mammogram results from 2000 to 2010 that indicated the need for further diagnostic imaging. Overall, just 57 percent of Asian women got necessary follow-up tests within a month, compared with 77 percent of white patients, the study found.    This gap in follow-up care persisted at three months for all Asian women except Japanese patients. After one year, 15 percent of Asian women still hadn’t gotten additional imaging done, compared with 10 percent of white patients. Filipina women had the highest odds of no follow-up care, with 18 percent not receiving additional imaging one year after an abnormal mammogram.    “We suspected that there would be differences in delays between white and Asian women, however we were surprised to find the degree of varying delay times among the different Asian subgroups,” said lead study author Kim Hanh Nguyen of the University of California, San Francisco.    “Filipino and Vietnamese women had the poorest outcomes in our study,” Nguyen said by email.    The goal of mammograms is to detect tumors before they can be felt in a physical breast exam, catching cancer sooner when it’s easier to treat. Even though most suspicious findings on mammograms turn out not to be cancer, doctors still urge women to get follow-up tests as quickly as possible so tumors have less time to grow.    Half of white women in the study got follow-up tests within 15 days, compared with 19 days for Japanese women, 28 days for Filipina women and 32 days for Vietnamese women.    Asians are one of the fastest-growing immigrant groups in the U.S., and people who identify as Asian or Asian with another race are projected to account for about 12 percent of the population, or about 49 million people, by 2060, the researchers note in the journal Cancer.    Previous studies highlighting disparities in mammogram follow-up care have often had too few Asian women to detect differences among ethnic subgroups, Nguyen said. The current study offers fresh insight into which Asian women are most at risk for delays that could lead to worse survival odds.    “Ethnic groups tend to share cultural traits such as physical appearance, beliefs and language or dialect, and group history, and these group characteristics can affect their breast cancer care experience in meaningful ways,” Nguyen said. “These findings can inform public health programs to tailor outreach to Asian women, particularly Filipinos and Vietnamese or other Southeast Asians.”   One limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on certain factors that might influence how quickly women got follow-up tests, such as breast symptoms or prior mammogram results, the authors note. It’s also possible that recent immigration or limited English skills might have contributed to longer follow-up times for some women.    Some women and their doctors might also have decided against follow-up imaging after considering the risks of additional tests such as unnecessary biopsies or treatment of tumors that would have been unlikely to prove fatal, said Dr. Gerd Gigerenzer, director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin.    “It could well be that Asian women are more aware of the lack of benefit and the likely harms of screening than white American women, or intuitively feel that harms are likely,” Gigerenzer, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    There also isn’t consensus in the medical community about exactly how quickly women need to get follow-up tests, noted Dr. Joann Elmore, a researcher at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle who wasn’t involved in the study.    “My advice to women is to work with their physicians and to schedule follow-up for an abnormal mammogram result as quickly as their schedule allows,” Elmore said by email. “As most women with these abnormalities do not end up having breast cancer, the anxiety experienced by women during this wait is their biggest risk.”  "
2swRnn6,2017-06-13,Science may be able to provide sunless tans," (Reuters Health) - Sun worshippers might someday be able to get a tan without exposing their skin to the harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation that’s responsible for skin cancers, a new study suggests.   The goal of the research is to prevent skin cancers by darkening the pigmentation of people’s skin, senior author Dr. David Fisher told Reuters Health.    “Very light skin and a very poor ability to tan correlates with a very high probability of developing cancer,” said Fisher, who is chief of the dermatology service at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.   Darker skin may block harmful UV radiation, Fisher said. So it’s possible that darkening the skin’s pigmentation might help neutralize the risk associated with genes for light-colored hair and fair skin.   A decade ago, Fisher’s team found a way to change the pigmentation of skin cells in mice from very fair to dark, which protected their cells from the type of UV damage that can lead to skin cancer.    Unfortunately, the topical agent that worked to darken the skin of mice didn’t work as effectively on thicker human skin.   Since then, the researchers have been trying to find alternative ways to achieve the same goal in humans, Fisher said.   Eventually, they identified enzymes - called small-molecule salt-inducible kinases - that help control pigmentation in a cell.   When the researchers applied the enzymes onto mice and samples of human skin in a lab, both the mice and the human skin turned increasingly dark as more enzymes were applied, according to the study published in Cell Reports.   Fisher said the darkened skin responded like a normal tan, but without the damage seen with UV radiation.   The darker pigment - the melanin - “won’t go away until the cells mature, die and fall of the surface,” he said.   The enzyme solution used in the study is far from being available at local pharmacies, however.   “As in anything that’s a new strategy, this needs toxicity testing to know it’s safe before going into man and all sorts of clinical trials,” said Fisher.   A drug that darkens pigmentation may have uses beyond the theoretical protection against skin cancer, including to cosmetically darken skin among people with other medical conditions, said Dr. Jonathan Zippin, of Weill Cornell Medicine’s Department of Dermatology in New York.   “There is a clear cosmetic application,” he told Reuters Health. “If you want to prove that you’ve improved skin cancer risk, you’ve got to do that study and that’s going to require time,” he noted.   “There is a limited number of drugs available that can effectively elevate pigmentation in a safe way,” said Zippin, who was not involved with the new research. “So this is exciting in the sense that it could be one such drug to fill that niche.”   Fisher is focused on developing a product that will protect against skin cancers.   “There is such a prevention opportunity that is missed right now,” he said.

2r0diiZ,2017-06-13,"Several non-drug options help with fatigue during, after cancer treatment","  (Story corrects name to Roger in paragraph 3)   By Carolyn Crist   (Reuters Health) - Non-drug approaches that work best at relieving cancer-related fatigue may differ during and after cancer treatment, according to an analysis of past trials.   During treatment, relaxation practices had the strongest fatigue-reducing effect, but after cancer treatments are complete, yoga provided the biggest benefit.    “During and after cancer therapy, fatigue is one of the most frequent and distressing symptoms,” said lead author Roger Hilfiker of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland Valais in Leukerbad.   Cancer-related fatigue is considered a “distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion related to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning,” the authors write in British Journal of Sports Medicine.   Depending on the types of cancer patients have and the treatments they receive, more than a quarter experience this kind of severe fatigue, and it can last for five years or more after treatment, the study team writes.    “Although there is a huge amount of scientific literature on this topic, it remains one of the symptoms for which cancer patients express high unmet supportive care needs,” Hilfiker told Reuters Health by email. “It seems the available research is not yet fully implemented in clinical practice.”   The researchers reviewed 245 studies published between 1989 and 2017 that evaluated non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce cancer-related fatigue during chemotherapy and radiotherapy or afterward. More than half of the studies involved women with breast cancer.   The analysis focused on conventional physiotherapy-related interventions such as movement therapy, relaxation, massage, yoga and Tai Chi and excluded trials that investigated nutritional supplements, acupuncture, acupressure, Reiki healing and expressive writing.    Hilfiker and colleagues found that during cancer treatment, relaxation exercises such as meditation and stretching were the most effective, followed by massage, combined exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy, and combined aerobic and resistance training. Healing touch, dance, music, Tai-Chi, and cognitive-behavioral therapy alone landed at the bottom of the list.    After cancer treatment, yoga was the most effective, followed by breathing exercises, combined aerobic and resistance training, dance and combined exercise and cognitive-behavioral therapy. At the bottom of the list, massage, relaxation, resistance exercise alone, aerobic exercise alone and cognitive-behavioral therapy alone were less effective.    “Relaxation seems to be an important part during cancer treatment,” Hilfiker said. “This might be very important for patients who are not motivated or not able to engage in more demanding physical activities.”   The next step is to look at the intensity, frequency and volume of exercise to understand what to recommend to patients, said Leorey Saligan, a principal investigator in the Symptom Management Branch of the National Institute of Nursing Research in Bethesda, Maryland.   “There’s been a big shift in the paradigm, especially in oncology research, in looking at treatments for patients,” Saligan, who wasn’t involved with this study, told Reuters Health. “This information can empower patients because they know they have options.”   Saligan is researching cancer-related fatigue and interventions from a biological perspective, aiming to understand what happens in the body to reduce the fatigue. If specific types of patients respond to specific types of therapies, doctors may be able to better recommend options to their patients.   “If we can predict which patients are at risk for fatigue based on their biological makeup, we can plan their interventions way ahead of time,” Saligan said. “We can now tell patients to go out and exercise, and next we want to be able to tell them how long, how often and how fast.”  "
2rV9Bf1,2017-06-09,Black and Hispanic patients less likely to see neurologists," (Reuters Health) - Black and Hispanic patients with neurologic disorders are less likely to see brain specialists than white people with these conditions, a recent U.S. study suggests.    Researchers examined data on more than 279,000 patients, including nearly 17,000 who reported having neurological disorders, like epilepsy, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis or other conditions like headaches or cerebrovascular disease.    They found that black patients were 28 percent less likely to see neurologists for outpatient care than white patients. Hispanic patients were 39 percent less likely to see neurologists, the study also found.    “Previous studies have focused on specific neurologic diseases such as stroke or Parkinson’s disease,” said lead study author Dr. Altaf Saadi, a neurology chief resident at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.    “This is the first study to look beyond individual neurologic diseases and show racial disparities among a broad range of neurologic illnesses, regardless of insurance, socioeconomic or health status,” Saadi said by email.    “This is a much larger issue than previously documented,” she added.   Neurologic illness is common, affecting about 14 percent of American households, researchers note in the journal Neurology. Stroke, for example, is a leading cause of disability and the third most common cause of death in the U.S., and rates of other neurologic disorders like Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease are projected to soar as the population ages.    Saadi’s team examined data collected from 2006 to 2013 from a nationally representative survey of medical expenditures.   Across the entire study population, just 6 percent reported having a neurological disorder. About 2 percent, or 5,890 patients, received a total of 13,685 outpatient neurology visits.   People who had at least one outpatient visit with a neurologist were more likely to be female, older, white, nonimmigrant, more educated and affluent and to have health benefits through Medicare or private insurance, the study found.    Patients with certain neurologic diagnoses such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Parkinson disease were more likely to see specialists than people with other types of neurologic conditions, the study also found.    Among participants with known neurologic conditions, blacks were more likely to be cared for in the emergency department, to have more hospital stays, and to have higher per capita inpatient expenditures than their white counterparts.   For every 100 patients with neurological disorders, 12.55 black patients went to the emergency room for care rather than seeing a neurologist in an outpatient clinic, compared with 7.66 Hispanic patients and 7.70 white patients.    Geography may explain some of these disparities, because outpatient neurological services are more widely available in regions like the Northeast, while there are fewer specialists in parts of the Southeastern U.S. where far more people have neurologic disorders requiring specialty care, the authors note.    One limitation of the study is that excludes people living in nursing homes and other institutional settings where many patients with seizures and dementia may reside, the authors point out. Researchers also lacked data on individual patient or physician choices or preferences about care, which might have influenced whether some people received outpatient neurology services.    Even so, the findings suggest that insufficient outpatient care may be disproportionately driving certain racial groups to the emergency room, said Dr. Jorge Burneo, a neurology researcher at Western University in London, Ontario, who wasn’t involved in the study.    These emergency department visits may also become more costly for people who didn’t get outpatient care or waited until symptoms got severe to seek help, Burneo said by email.    “If a patient visited his or her neurologist on a regular basis, there would be better control of the neurological problem, which would avoid an emergency room visit and admission to a hospital,” Burneo added.

2s0YN1Y,2017-06-09,Walking their dogs keeps elderly active," (Reuters Health) - Senior citizens who live with dogs appear to meet internationally recognized exercise goals just by walking them, a new study suggests.   Researchers matched 43 older adults with dogs to another 43 without dogs and measured their time spent walking. Compared to those without canine companions, dog owners walked on average 23 minutes more a day - enough to meet U.S. and international exercise recommendations for substantial health benefits, the research found.    “It’s very difficult to find any other intervention that produces this size of effect,” said senior author Dr. Daniel Simon Mills, a professor of veterinary behavioral medicine at the University of Lincoln in England.   “It’s good evidence that dog ownership amongst the elderly increases physical activity in a meaningful and healthy way,” he said in a video call.   Participants in the study were 65 to 81 years old, lived independently in one of three counties in England and wore monitors that measured their movements for three one-week periods over the course of a year. The time periods were designed to capture participants’ steps in different seasons and under varied weather conditions, researchers reported in BioMed Central Public Health.    Dog owners and participants who did not own dogs were matched by gender, height, weight, health conditions and walking abilities. All were white British, and nearly two-thirds were women. The average participant was at least slightly overweight.   The average dog in the study was nearly eight years old.    Dog owners walked on average 21 minutes more than those without dogs at an at-least moderate pace, the study found.    “Virtually all of the increased exercise is not just dawdling,” Mills said. “It’s marching.”   Over the course of a week, the additional 147 minutes dog owners spent walking at a moderate pace would in itself be just three minutes shy of World Health Organization recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous weekly physical activity, the study authors note.    The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that adults do a minimum of 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity a week.    By matching dog owners to people without dogs, Mills said he believes the new study clarifies that the benefits of dog ownership stem from having dogs, rather than from dog owners being more active in the first place.   But Marcia Stefanick, a professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California, hesitated to ascribe all the benefits to the dogs.   “Despite ‘successful matching’ on what the authors consider key variables, a person who is ready and willing to walk a dog at least twice a day is more likely to get a dog than one who sees that commitment as too challenging,” said Stefanick, who researches disease prevention and was not involved in the study.    “On the other hand, once a person has a dog, the motivation and likelihood that he or she would at least walk around the block, with several stops along the way, would clearly be higher,” she said in an email.   The study confirms previous studies in which dog owners reported walking more than people without dogs. It also shows that the additional walking was at a moderate clip.    “We saw a big increase in healthy activity and at a level that is considered to be health promoting,” Mills said.    “If you’d like to get a dog, don’t be put off by the fact you’re elderly,” he said. “It’s good for the dog, and it’s good for you.”  "
2sHYdmL,2017-06-09,Kids born through fertility treatment show normal mental development," (Reuters Health) - Despite concerns that children born through Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) may develop differently from other kids, a UK study finds they have normal mental skills until at least age 11.     In fact, at ages 3 and 5 years, kids born as a result of these techniques had greater verbal cognitive ability than those born through natural conception, though this gap diminished with time. Researchers say that the older, better educated and more financially well-off parents of ART kids may play an important role in this difference at early ages.    “In the last decade, we’ve seen a huge increase in the use of ART and discussions about the outcomes and child development,” said lead author Anna Barbuscia, a sociology researcher at the University of Oxford.    The first “test tube baby” was born in the UK in 1978. And globally, about 5 million children have been conceived with ART since then, according to the U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.   “We’re finding that this way of birth is not linked to problems, and in fact, could show consistent better cognitive development in early childhood years,” Barbuscia told Reuters Health. “We were surprised about the results.”   She and her Oxford colleague Melinda Mills analyzed data on 15,218 children from the UK Millennium Cohort Study, which follows infants born in 2000 and 2001. All had been tested on vocabulary, verbal ability and reading at ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 years. Within this group, 186 children had been conceived through ART.   The research team found that children conceived through ART had higher verbal ability scores at ages 3 and 5 years, but the difference decreased over time and disappeared by age 11.    “We want to be very clear that our results don’t show that ART is better but that it has no impact overall on cognitive abilities,” Barbuscia said. “We’re doing additional studies now to see what the comparison is after age 11.”   One limitation of the study is the small number of ART-conceived children included. In addition, the research team writes in the journal Human Reproduction, more study is needed to understand the higher verbal skills scores among ART children at early ages.    Parental socioeconomic status, education and home environment may play a large part, for example, if those who can afford ART spend more time or money on early education efforts, the authors suggest.   “It’s perhaps surprising that the differences do not persist, but as the authors note, other factors external to the home may have more influence as the children grow up,” said Claire Carson of the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at the University of Oxford.    Carson, who wasn’t involved in the current study, has conducted similar research on the same Millennium Cohort Study population and found no differences in cognitive abilities for 3- and 5-year-olds, as well as some evidence of mental health issues among ART kids at ages 7 and 8.   “Cognitive outcomes are only one area of research into child outcomes after fertility treatment that is being conducted globally,” she told Reuters Health by email. “There are still evidence gaps with regard to long-term health and development that need to be addressed.”   To try to fill those gaps, Carson is looking at long-term health in a study of more than 200,000 children, which should include enough ART-conceived kids to assess a range of outcomes, she said.    Barbuscia and colleagues are also currently studying new data for children up to age 14, and examining influences such as socioeconomic status and parenting style.   “When it comes to fertility, medicine has to keep up with society, not the other way around,” said Dr. Jacques Balayla of the University of Montreal. Balayla, who wasn’t involved with the current work, has done similar research on ART-conceived babies in Canada. In a study published earlier this year, he found no differences from other children in the cognitive abilities of 2-year-olds born through ART. ( reut.rs/2rU0NWK )   “Women are delaying motherhood, which is associated with higher risks for fertility, and we’re seeing an increasing need to use ART,” he told Reuters Health. “Understanding the consequences - not only in the short-term and for the mother, but for the long-term and in the children - is of paramount importance.”  "
2qXAqCc,2017-06-09,Medical costs of bike crashes on the rise," (Reuters Health) - Over the last two decades, the number of people injured in bicycle accidents in the U.S. has been rising and the cost of each crash has also gone up, according to a recent study.   The increases in accidents and medical costs are partly the result of increased ridership overall, the researchers write in the journal Injury Prevention, but the higher cost per accident is mainly driven by larger numbers of riders over age 45 and more street and highway crashes that may involve cars.    “We advocate for cycling, as the proven health benefits certainly outweigh the potential health risks,” said senior author Dr. Benjamin Breyer of the University of California, San Francisco.   “Our hope is that by quantifying these costs it will help to spur discussion and policy surrounding infrastructure for safe cycling,” Breyer told Reuters Health by email.   Past research has shown that the number of bicycle-related accidents leading to hospital admission has risen dramatically, the researchers write.    To determine how medical and quality of life costs related to bike crashes are evolving, the study team used data collected between 1997 and 2013 on adult bicycle injuries.    The data on non-fatal crashes came from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System while the fatal crash data was from the National Vital Statistics System.   The research team also used cost estimates from the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s Injury Cost Model to determine costs of work missed and quality of life lost due to crashes.   They found that 3.8 million non-fatal adult bicycle injuries and just under 10,000 deaths were reported between 1997 and 2013.    The total cost of bicycle injuries over the study period was $ 209 billion for nonfatal injuries and $28 billion for bike-related deaths.    The number of non-fatal biking injuries increased by about 6,500 each year and the total costs rose by an average of $789 million annually. But the injury costs per mile traveled by bike fell from $2.85 in 2001 to $2.35 in 2009.   Overall, the costs of nonfatal biking injuries rose by nearly 140 percent, from $9.3 billion in 1997 to $22.4 billion in 2013.    Over the study period, the share of costs attributed to riders over age 45 rose steadily by about 1.6 percent each year. Bicycle-related deaths also increased for people over 45 and decreased for those under 45.   In addition, crashes occurring on streets or highways played an increasing role, with their share of the total costs rising by 0.8 percent each year.    “Encouraging people to use bicycles must occur along with building safer cycling infrastructure such as cycle tracks and better street lighting,” said Morteza Asgarzadeh, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston.   “Bicyclists, especially the older sub-populations, should become well-informed about the risks they take by using bicycles,” Asgarzadeh told Reuters Health by email.   Although building biking infrastructure is expensive, it could ultimately help bring down costs due to crashes, Breyer noted.   “In fact, we could build cycling infrastructure in one-sixth of the entire U.S. for the same cost of all these injuries in 10 years,” Breyer said.   Asgarzadeh advised cyclists to be vigilant and drivers to watch out for bikes and give them room on the road.   “While bicycling has many health benefits, injuries can be costly and lengthy, especially for people over 40. Prevention is still the best and least expensive way to tackle the issue,” Asgarzadeh said.   Breyer added that all cyclists should wear helmets. “The health benefits of cycling certainly outweigh the potential drawbacks. Many, many people cycle every day injury free,” he said.  "
2s7HBrH,2017-06-08,Tanning bed use declining among U.S. adults," (Reuters Health) - The number of U.S. adults using indoor tanning machines decreased by a third between 2010 and 2015, a recent study suggests.   Although indoor tanning remains popular, especially among young non-Hispanic white women, even that group saw a roughly 30 percent decline in tanning bed use, researchers report in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.   “Indoor tanning and sunburns increase the risk for skin cancer, including melanoma,” said lead author Gery Guy of the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.    Another recent study by Guy and colleagues found that indoor tanning among adolescents had dropped by more than half from 2009 to 2015.   “Such reductions suggest that more people are getting the message about the damages of indoor tanning and understanding that tanned skin is damaged skin,” Guy told Reuters Health by email.   For the current study, the researchers analyzed data from the annual National Health Interview Survey, a nationally-representative sample of about 25 million U.S. adults over age 18. Participants were asked about their use of indoor tanning and any sunburns they experienced, indoors or outdoors, during the past year.    In 2010, 5.5 percent of survey participants used indoor tanning, which dropped to 3.5 percent in 2015. Those figures include a decrease from 8.6 percent of women and 2.2 percent of men tanning in 2010 to 5.2 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively, in 2015.    In the adult group that uses tanning beds the most - white non-Hispanic women between the ages of 18 and 21 - usage dropped from 31.8 percent in 2010 to 20.4 percent in 2015.   The results also linked indoor tanning to sunburns, with about 41 percent of indoor tanners saying they had at least one sunburn during the year, compared with 34 percent of people who didn’t use tanning beds. Among 18 to 29-year-old white women, 77 percent of indoor tanners reported a sunburn compared to 62.5 percent of peers who didn’t use indoor tanning. In addition, 6.7 percent of indoor tanners reported having been burned by a tanning machine.   The researchers speculate that the higher risk of sunburn among indoor tanners may result both from tan-seeking behavior in general and a misperception of the sunburn protection offered by an existing “base” tan.   “It is encouraging that evidence is emerging of reduced exposure to indoor tanning,” said Michael Bracken of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.    “However, as this practice incurs absolutely no benefit in the face of increased risk of a potentially lethal disease, continued efforts to further reduce exposure is important,” Bracken, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Reuters Health by email.   The drop in tanning bed usage may be related to the 10 percent excise tax implemented by the Affordable Care Act in 2010, as well as state laws restricting minors’ access to tanning beds, the study authors note.     “Historically, tanning has been persistent among young white women - and research is showing us, gay men as well - due to social norms around the appearance of tan skin. Some people feel they really look better with a tan,” said Sherry Pagoto of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “There are misconceptions still that tanning beds are safer than tanning outside, but the source of UV radiation doesn’t matter,” she told Reuters Health.    “There’s no such thing as a safe tan,” Pagoto added. “The ‘base tan’ idea is not real and not safe to do.”   Guy advises wearing sunglasses, broad-spectrum sunscreen and protective clothing outdoors, as well as avoiding sunbathing and finding shade during midday hours. Pagoto also recommends self-tanning products for the same glow with no UV exposure.   “If it’s hard to give up the idea of tanner skin, explore self-tanners, which have improved significantly in the past several years, so you can have a risk-free tan,” Pagoto said. “Tanning leads to wrinkling and sun spots - ask any 40-something woman what she regrets doing, and you’ll get the same response.”  "
2sYSTdU,2017-06-08,"Even low arsenic levels in water tied to small, preterm babies"," (Reuters Health) - Low levels of arsenic naturally found in drinking water in many U.S. states are associated with an increased risk of premature and underweight babies, a study in Ohio suggests.    Arsenic is one of the most common elements in the Earth’s crust and a natural contaminant in water in many regions of the world. While previous research has found high levels of arsenic in the water associated with a variety of birth complications in places like China, Argentina and Bangladesh, less is known about what happens to babies in places where pregnant women drink water with small amounts of arsenic.    For the current study, researchers examined data on 428,804 births in Ohio from 2006 to 2008 to see how birth outcomes differed based on county-level arsenic exposure in the water. Because up to 80 percent of homes in some counties had private well water - for which arsenic data wasn’t available - researchers restricted their analysis to counties where less than 10 percent or 20 percent of homes used well water.   In counties where less than 10 percent of the population used private wells, arsenic in public drinking water was associated with 14 percent higher odds of very low birth weight babies and 10 percent higher odds of premature deliveries, researchers report in Environmental Research.    “Arsenic contamination varies geographically, based on underlying geology,” said lead study author Kirsten Almberg, a public health researcher at the University of Illinois at Chicago.    “Testing your drinking water for a variety of contaminants including arsenic and lead is sound advice,” Almberg said by email.    The study found negative birth outcomes even when women lived in counties where tap water might expose them to arsenic levels below 10 micrograms per liter (10 ug/L), the maximum amount considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Almberg noted. This suggests EPA regulations may not protect women from reproductive problems linked to arsenic, she said.    The study didn’t find an association between higher use of tap water at the county level and a risk of very premature infants or infants being small for their gestational age but not very low birth weight. Drinking water with arsenic did appear linked to a higher risk of low birth weight babies, but the added risk was too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.     The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how specific levels of arsenic in drinking water might lead to negative birth outcomes.    Other limitations include incomplete or missing arsenic measurements for certain counties at certain points of time during the study, as well as the possibility that pregnant women drank water from sources that weren’t measured in the study.    “The disadvantage is that we don’t know exactly how much of the arsenic-tainted water the mothers were consuming, so the study simply assumes an overall average for each county,” said Philippe Grandjean, chair of environmental medicine at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense.    “This means that it is not possible to explore whether greater adverse effects were seen in births where the mother had consumed much public water, as compared with mothers who preferred bottled water,” Grandjean, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Overall, this imprecision means that the study probably underestimated the adverse effects, and that arsenic is more toxic to the baby than the authors calculated.”   Women who are worried about arsenic exposure during pregnancy should get their water tested if they use a private well, said Xindi Hu of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston. Municipal water supplies should already get routine testing.    They can also take a folate supplement because this can potentially reduce the toxicity of arsenic during pregnancy, Hu, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “I won’t suggest drinking only bottled water because it should be just a short-term emergency response, not a long-term solution,” Hu said. “What is even more severe, bottled water is not necessarily cleaner or safer than tap water.”  "
2s85KhJ,2017-06-08,Teen drunkenness linked to an early grave," (Reuters Health) - People who get drunk for the first time before their fifteenth birthday are more likely to die prematurely than people who don’t drink excessively or at least avoid getting drunk until they’re older, a U.S. study suggests.   Researchers examined data on drinking habits and death records for almost 15,000 adults who were followed for almost three decades. Compared to participants who said they never got drunk, people who did this at least once before age 15 were 47 percent more likely to die during the study period, while getting drunk at 15 or older was associated with 20 percent higher odds of death.   “Early onset of drinking and drunkenness are associated with alcohol use disorders, and therefore may play a role in elevated alcohol use disorder-related mortality rates,” said lead study author Hui Hu, a public health researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville.   But the study results suggest that addiction isn’t the only factor contributing to premature deaths for early drinkers, Hu said by email.   “We found that an estimated 21 percent of the total effects of early drunkenness were mediated through alcohol use disorders, suggesting that many other factors in addition to alcohol use disorders may play important roles,” Hu said.    To explore the connection between early drunkenness and a premature death, researchers analyzed data from interviews conducted in the early 1980s that asked people if they had ever had a drunken episode and how old they were the first time it happened. Most participants were between 18 and 44 years old when they completed the interviews.    A total of 9,089 participants, or 61 percent, said they had been drunk, with most of them first getting drunk at or after age 15. About 13 percent of the people who had been drunk did this for the first time before they turned 15.    About 37 percent of the people who got drunk before age 15 had diagnosed alcohol use disorders at the time of the baseline interviews, compared to an 11 percent rate of these disorders in the overall group, researchers report in Drug and Alcohol Dependence.    By the end of the study period, 26 percent of those who had been drunk before age 15 had died, compared to about 23 percent of those who got drunk later and 19 percent of those who had never been drunk.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how people’s age when they first get drunk influences how long they live.    Another limitation of the study is that researchers combined people who said they never got drunk and people who abstained from alcohol altogether into one category. They also didn’t distinguish between teens who got drunk at 13 or 14 from kids who got drunk even younger, the authors note.    “We know that alcohol abuse leads to earlier mortality, but it is also possible that earlier abuse reflects other genetic or environmental characteristics that lead to earlier mortality,” Dr. Michael Criqui, a public health researcher at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Early drunkenness might point to other risk factors such as risk-taking behavior, mental health issues or a lack of social or economic support that might influence overall health and longevity, noted Dr. Gregory Marcus, a researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “No one should interpret these data to mean that their fate is sealed,” Marcus said by email. “On the contrary, these findings are useful exactly because they may help us identify those at risk so we can prevent these adverse outcomes.”   Because the increased mortality risk exists even among people without alcohol addiction, it’s possible that people who aren’t diagnosed with alcohol use disorders might still need be careful about how much they drink, said Joy Bohyun Jang of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.    “Those with alcohol use disorders may receive attention to their alcohol use behaviors by practitioners or they themselves may be cautious about their alcohol use,” Jang, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “But what this study tells us is that those without alcohol use disorder may need the same level of attention if they experience drunkenness early in their life.”  "
2qIxcNR,2017-06-07,Do antidepressants in pregnancy raise kids’ ADHD risk?," (Reuters Health) - Women with depression may be more likely than other mothers to have children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) even if they don’t take antidepressants during pregnancy, a recent study suggests.    The results indicate that at least part of the link previously seen between kids’ exposure to antidepressants during pregnancy and their risk of developing ADHD may be explained by “family factors” such as maternal depression, rather than the drugs themselves, the study authors write in The BMJ.   When the researchers compared the children of women with psychiatric disorders who had either taken antidepressants during pregnancy or only before pregnancy, they found the ADHD risk among their children was similar. This was also true for siblings with the same mother but different exposures to antidepressants during pregnancy.   “Pregnant women should not stop treatment because of concerns of ADHD in their children in the future,” senior study author Ian C.K. Wong, of the school of pharmacy at University College London said by email.    In the study of 190,618 kids born in Hong Kong from 2001 to 2009, just 3 percent of the children were diagnosed with ADHD or treated for the condition after an average follow-up of more than nine years.        The type of antidepressant might matter. Researchers didn’t find a meaningful association between children’s ADHD and their mother’s use during pregnancy of a family of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that includes Prozac, Zoloft and Celexa, according to the report in The BMJ.    Women who took other types of antidepressants while pregnant were 59 percent more likely to have kids with ADHD than women who didn’t use any antidepressants, however. This might be because women with milder depression typically get SSRIs first, and only try other drugs when they have more severe psychiatric problems that aren’t helped by SSRIs, the authors note.    Even when women never used antidepressants, mothers with psychiatric disorders were 84 percent more likely to have kids with ADHD than mothers without mental health problems, the study also found.   One limitation of the study is that it only included births at public hospitals, the authors note, but this is where most specialist care for kids with brain development issues is provided in Hong Kong. Researchers also used prescription records to assess whether women took antidepressants, which don’t always reflect the drugs people actually take.    Four of the study authors report past grants or consulting work for companies that make antidepressants, and one is an employee of Janssen Research and Development, LLC, a Johnson and Johnson division with an antidepressant under development.    Left untreated, depression during pregnancy is associated with underweight babies who are more likely to wind up in neonatal intensive care, previous research has found. Pregnant women with uncontrolled depression may not eat well or keep up with prenatal visits, and, in the most severe cases they may be at increased risk for suicide.   Like many drugs, antidepressants fall into a gray area during pregnancy, with insufficient evidence to definitively prove the harms or benefits. Often, doctors may only consider these drugs for women with more severe depression.   Because some uncertainties about antidepressant use in pregnancy remain, it still makes sense to reserve them for women with serious psychiatric symptoms, Wong said.    “Pregnant women with mild depression may benefit from non-drug treatment such as psychotherapy,” Wong added.    The study findings aren’t surprising, however, and should reassure women who do need to take antidepressants during pregnancy, said Dr. Roy Perlis, a psychiatry researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study.    “No one wants to take medications they don’t need,” Perlis added. “But people sometimes forget that depression itself carries risk.”  "
2qJqacH,2017-06-07,Risk of heart defect in babies of women on lithium is less than thought," (Reuters Health) - One risk of taking lithium for bipolar disorder during the first trimester of pregnancy is turning out to be lower than once thought.   A new U.S. study has concluded that the odds of having a child with a heart malformation are 1 in 100, but that’s not nearly as pronounced as earlier data had suggested.   And only at the highest dose of 900 milligrams (mg) per day was the link to heart defects clear, researchers report in the New England Journal of Medicine.   “Lithium was not significantly associated with cardiac malformations for daily doses lower than 900 mg,” the chief author of the new study Dr. Elisabetta Patorno of Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston told Reuters Health in an email.   However, she said, the data also indicate that some increase in risk cannot be ruled out for daily doses lower than 900 mg.   The fact that the risk is not as severe as previously thought “can actually be very reassuring for women, specifically for women who have bipolar disorder who need medication because pregnancy is a very high-risk time for a recurrent mood episode,” said Dr. Neha Hudepohl, medical director at the Center for Women’s Behavioral Health at Women and Infants Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island.    “The highest priority is for the woman to be healthy,” Hudepohl, who was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health. “That’s what leads to healthy pregnancies, healthy delivery and healthy mother-child relationships.”   In the analysis of 1.3 million pregnancies, the overall rate of heart malformation in the babies of women treated with lithium was 2.41 percent versus 1.15 percent for women not exposed to the drug, representing a relative risk increase of 65 percent for babies of mothers taking the drug.   The rise in relative risk differed significantly depending on the dose of drug the mother was taking, however. When the daily dose was 600 mg or less, the risk increased by just 11 percent, which is too small to rule out the possibility it was due to chance. The risk jumped by 60 percent when the dose was between 600 and 900 mg. And with a dose above 900 mg, the chances of the heart defect more than tripled.   The good news: “Original evidence showed a much stronger association” between the drug and heart problems,” Patorno said. “We’re seeing a much more modest risk in cardiac effects.”   In the 1970s, there was evidence that lithium produced a five-fold increase in heart defects for newborns and that the chance of developing a specific defect, known as Ebstein’s anomaly, was 400 times greater. Ebstein’s, which manifests as a reduction of blood flow to the lungs, can produce no symptoms or severe symptoms.   The choice of whether to give lithium in reproductive-age women is complicated because some women respond very well to lithium and alternative drugs also carry risks, Patorno told Reuters Health. “Other mood stabilizers are potentially associated with other problems.”   Thus, lithium is often a first choice for women with bipolar disorder who might become pregnant.   Hudepohl said she tells women, “If we don’t treat your symptoms, if you’re actively depressed, or have bipolar disorder, or you’re suicidal or manic, that is usually quite risky for the pregnancy. And it doesn’t just have an emotional and psychological impact. It has a real physical impact on the pregnancy as well. We know there are higher rates of miscarriage, preterm labor, more babies born small for gestational age, and higher rates of C-section. There can be quite significant medical complications.”   Nonetheless, some women stop taking lithium on their own or have an abortion if they discover they’re pregnant out of fear that it might cause birth defects. The abortion rate is 5 percent to 10 percent higher among women who take lithium than in the general population, she noted.   “They just sort of assume that it’s too risky to continue,” Hudepohl said. “And low and behold, their symptoms worsen, they become depressed or manic or anxious, and they get sick very quickly. Then we have to fight very hard to stabilize them and get them healthy again.”  "
2rV8pua,2017-06-07,Menopause symptoms may be worse for obese women," (Reuters Health) - Obese women may suffer more severe menopause symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats than their slimmer peers, a Brazilian study suggests.   Researchers compared menopause symptoms for women at a healthy weight to women who were either overweight or obese and found that three symptoms got progressively worse as women’s size increased: hot flashes and night sweats, muscle and joint problems and bladder issues.    “Intensity of hot flashes increased progressively with body mass index (BMI) and obesity had a great impact on daily activities such as involuntary interruption of work tasks and decrease of overall performance,” said lead study author Dr. Lucia Costa-Paiva of the State University of Campinas in Sao Paulo.   “There was also a lower level of leisure time activities in these women,” Costa-Paiva said by email. “Thus it adds strong evidence to encourage women on losing weight.”   Women go through menopause when they stop menstruating, which typically happens between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterwards, women can experience symptoms ranging from vaginal dryness to mood swings, joint pain and insomnia.   Recent research has found that 57 percent of women between ages 40 and 64 worldwide experience hot flashes, 60 percent report sexual dysfunction, 62 percent have joint and muscle pain and 50 percent have sleep problems, the study authors note in the journal Menopause.   Doctors have long believed that obesity might protect against hot flashes because fat tissue boosts the body’s supply of estrogen, a hormone that can help blunt the severity of these symptoms, Costa-Paiva said. But the current study builds on more recent research that points in the opposite direction, suggesting that obesity might make hot flashes worse because fat works as an insulator trapping heat in the body, she said.   To assess the relationship between obesity and menopause symptom severity, Costa-Paiva and colleagues examined survey data from 749 Brazilian women aged 45 to 60 years old. Women scored symptoms from zero for no issues to four points for very severe problems.    Participants were about 53 years old on average and had typically gone through menopause when they were around 47 years old. While most of them, 68 percent, were postmenopausal, about 16 percent had not started going through menopause yet and another 16 percent were midway through the process.    The study included 288 women with a BMI below 25, which researchers classified as a normal or healthy weight, 255 overweight women with a BMI of at least 25 and less than 30, and 206 obese women with a BMI of 30 or more.    It wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how obesity impacts the frequency or severity of menopause symptoms. Another limitation of the survey is that it relied on women to accurately recall and report on previous experiences with symptoms, the authors note.   “To date, the evidence that weight loss will reduce symptoms is lacking as no such clinical trial has been done,” said Dr. Susan Davis, a women’s health researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “But we encourage weight loss at midlife in overweight women to reduce risks of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and breast cancer,” Davis said by email.    Research linking obesity to worse menopause symptoms started emerging more than a decade ago, noted Dr. Mary Jane Minkin, a reproductive health researcher at Yale Medical School in New Haven, Connecticut, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “The theory is that heat is generated centrally, and heavy women have more insulation, so that the heat can not be dissipated as well and they get hotter,” Minkin said by email.    Losing weight can help with hot flashes as well as with muscle and joint pain associated with menopause that may be exacerbated by the extra pounds, Minkin added.   "
2s4i4zp,2017-06-07,Should you wait before having surgery for an ACL tear?," (Reuters Health) - For some people, delaying knee surgery after an ACL rupture and trying exercise therapy instead may produce better outcomes over the long term, researchers suggest.   Doing surgery on a torn ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) soon after the injury may be linked to worse problems five years later, especially if an individual also has a lot of pain and swelling or has injured other parts of the knee at the same time, lead study author Dr. Stephanie Filbay of the University of Oxford in the UK said by email.    It can lead to a longer recovery and worse prognosis, she told Reuters Health.   Filbay and her colleagues analyzed data from a trial comparing outcomes for 18-to-35 year olds who, within a month of an acute ACL injury, were randomly assigned to surgery plus exercise or exercise therapy alone with the option to have surgery later.    Sixty-two participants had surgery plus exercise therapy and 59 had exercise therapy first. Half of the exercise-first group went on to have surgery: 23 of them about two years after the injury and seven in the three years after that, according to the report in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.   Exercise therapy alone led to fewer knee symptoms compared with early surgery plus exercise therapy, at least in the short term.   Those who had early ACL surgery and also had an injured meniscus (cartilage pad in the knee joint) were less able to participate in sports post-surgery, and those who also had an injured ankle had a worse quality of life after surgery.    On the other hand, those who had exercise therapy alone and went on to have surgery on a different part of the knee had worse pain five years later than those who didn’t have non-ACL surgery.   Taken together, the authors say, the findings suggest that young, active individuals with an acute ACL injury who also have an injured meniscus, and those who have more severe knee pain and functional problems early on may benefit most from starting with exercise therapy first, before considering ACL reconstruction.   However, decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis, they advise.   Dr. Michael Alaia, an orthopedic surgeon at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York, said this study was small and “larger studies will be necessary to truly understand which patients may benefit from an extended trial of non-operative management of their ACL tears.”    While the authors found that some active young people might benefit from an exercise-first approach, Alaia suggests the approach might benefit patients who are less physically active, have other medical conditions or don’t engage in sports requiring pivoting.    “Limiting the number of ‘giving way’ episodes could reduce the chance of further damage to other important structures inside the knee,” he told Reuters Health in an email.   Alaia noted that many of his New York City patients who had no insurance coverage until after implementation of the Affordable Care Act had ACL tears years earlier - as active teenagers or young adults - but could not obtain treatment. “Unfortunately, a great number of these patients went on to develop significant cartilage or meniscus damage at an early age,” he said.   “This highlights the dilemma we have as surgeons - to try and figure out which patients will demonstrate continued instability and who will not,” he said, “and treat them appropriately before they go on to develop irreversible changes.”  "
2qUBouK,2017-06-06,U.S. nutrition policies may cut heart disease and save lives," (Reuters Health) - Public health policies have the potential to reduce heart disease in the U.S. and save nearly 250,000 lives over 15 years, researchers say.   The kinds of policies they’re talking about would lower the price of fruit and vegetables, help lower-income families make better choices, impose taxes on sugary drinks and launch media campaigns, according to a report in the journal PLoS Medicine.     “I think what our study does is highlight the potential power of food policies to reduce cardiovascular mortality and disparities in the U.S.,” said lead author Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard, of Imperial College London.   Pearson-Stuttard and colleagues say large disparities exist along social and economic lines when it comes to diet and heart disease. While past research found policies could influence diets, the measurable effects on heart disease in the U.S. are unknown.   “The key question we’re trying to answer overall is which policies are best buys for policymakers to consider,” said co-senior author Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University in Boston.   Using a computer model, the researchers estimated what various policies might mean for heart disease in the U.S. between 2015 and 2030.   Those national policies included a media campaign and a 10 percent tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. The researchers also analyzed the effect of subsidizing the cost of fruits and vegetables, by 10 percent in general and by 30 percent for people on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), also known as food stamps.   A national 10 percent subsidy on fruits and vegetables would be the most beneficial policy, with approximately 150,500 lives saved from deaths by heart disease over the 15-year study period, the authors estimate.    A 30 percent subsidy for SNAP participants would likely save 35,100 lives, and a 10 percent soda tax would save 31,000 lives, they calculate. A year-long mass media campaign was estimated to save 25,800 lives.   Mozaffarian said it’s interesting that a national soda tax would save only about a fifth of the lives saved by a national 10 percent subsidy of fruits and vegetables.   “That’s not something that would be obvious without doing the analysis,” he said.   The estimates also suggested that a targeted subsidy for SNAP participants, which has been tested in Massachusetts, would narrow the gap in heart disease rates between low-income and higher-income people by 8 percent.   Pearson-Stuttard told Reuters Health the large gains among SNAP participants can be attributed to their higher risks for heart disease and stroke, and their lower consumption of fruits and vegetables.   When the researchers estimated the potential benefit of implementing all of the policies together, they found that nearly 230,000 lives could be saved over 15 years while reducing the heart disease disparity between SNAP-eligible and -ineligible people by 6 percent.   The researchers can’t say how much such policies would cost, but Pearson-Stuttard said they may be cost-neutral since revenue would increase for certain foods while decreasing for others.   “It’s very likely these (expenses) over time would be cost-saving because of the savings in the healthcare system and contributions to the wider economy,” he said.  "
2rcPLh0,2017-06-06,Does chondroitin trump an anti-inflammatory for arthritic knee pain?," A daily supplement of pharmaceutical grade chondroitin is as good as celecoxib (Celebrex) at relieving arthritic knee pain and doesn’t have dangerous side effects, researchers say.    Dr. Jean-Yves Reginster of Liege State University in Belgium and colleagues recruited 604 people over age 50 with knee osteoarthritis from five European countries and randomly assigned them to take 800 mg of the extra-pure chondroitin sulfate (Chondrosulf), 200 mg of celecoxib (Celebrex) or a placebo every day for six months.    Those who took chondroitin sulfate or celecoxib had similar levels of pain relief at the end of the study, and in both groups the improvement was greater than for those taking just a placebo, according to the report in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.    Reginster told Reuters Health the findings are in line with earlier studies showing pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate could significantly decrease the progression of knee osteoarthritis over a period of three years.   He stressed that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin is not the same as over-the-counter supplements, which are made differently and can’t get into the joint in high enough concentrations to combat the causes of cartilage degradation and pain.   European regulatory bodies recommend pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate as well as pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine sulfate as first-line treatments for osteoarthritis, Reginster said by email, because of the side effects associated with celecoxib and other non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including stomach ulcers, bleeding, liver and kidney problems.   Dr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months.    In addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn’t involved in the study. Some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen (also an NSAID), and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo, he told Reuters Health.    “I tell my patients, ‘buyer beware,’” Shepard said in an email. “I tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature. I tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it, then keep taking it.”    If chondroitin doesn’t work for them, he suggests taking an NSAID “periodically,” and to be aware of the side effects.    “If you are going to stay on an NSAID for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor,” Shepard cautioned.    Dr. Rachel Wolfe of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed that chondroitin is “reasonable to try” for some people, especially those with contraindications to NSAIDs.    “However, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. It should be used in conjunction with these measures,” said Wolfe, who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Chondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,” Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. “Studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.”   The study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.

2qxUGWP,2017-06-06,Farm pollutants affect neighbors’ lungs," (Reuters Health) - Air pollution from large-scale livestock farms impairs lung function in neighbors who live nearby, a new study from the Netherlands shows.   “It’s well known that air pollution causes lung problems, and usually we think about air pollution from industry, cars,” said senior author Lidwien Smit. “Until now, it’s been seen as an urban health problem but not so much as a big problem in rural areas,” he added.   “Our study shows that air pollution from livestock farms is causing lung function declines in areas where people live near farms,” Smit, an environmental epidemiologist and professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, said in a Skype interview.   She and her team measured several markers of lung function in 2,308 adults who lived in 12 villages near, but not on, farms in the Netherlands, which has one of the world’s highest population densities as well as one of the highest livestock farm densities.    The more livestock farms that were near participants’ homes - within 1,000 meters, or six-tenths of a mile - the more impairments researchers found in how participants expelled air when they exhaled.    The study also showed that neighboring residents’ lung function was reduced during weeks with higher levels of farm-related ammonia air pollution, Smit said. The effects on breathing patterns were small but significant, she said.   Prior studies have shown that livestock farms contain high levels of dust, which can lead to respiratory problems in farm workers, the authors write in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.   Livestock farms also emit ammonia, an irritant gas formed by enzymes in animal waste. When ammonia reacts with other gases, it forms fine dust particles, Smit said.   Dr. Daniel Jackson, a pediatrician and professor at University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison, said the study highlights how public policy can impact individual health.   “Decisions that can lead to worsening air quality can have very significant impacts on health,” said Jackson, who was not involved with the study.   “This paper highlights one potential exposure that can have an impact on respiratory health,” he said in a phone interview.   He noted that the neighbors who appeared to be the most affected by farm pollution were those who had chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, which inflame the airways. These conditions include emphysema, chronic bronchitis and asthma.   Jackson said the findings would not prompt him to recommend that people living near large-scale farms consider moving, however.    “People should be aware of these exposures, and if they’re having respiratory symptoms associated with these sorts of exposures, it’s something to look into and have further evaluated,” he said.   The study appears at first glance to contradict a growing body of research that suggests children who grow up on farms may be at reduced risk of allergies and asthma, Jackson said.   But Smit said studies of children on farms have focused on smaller operations.   “There are also benefits from a farm environment,” she said. “But it depends on what kind of farms and pollution you’re looking at.”   Farms with 1,000 pigs, for example, create a completely different environment for children than a small family farm.    The factory farms “are emitting large-scale pollutants and dust,” she said. “Children are not going to play on these pig farms.”   Last week, government regulators in the Netherlands ordered poultry farmers to cut dust emissions by half over the next 10 years, she said.    “Farmers know something needs to be done to reduce pollution and the risks,” Smit said. “It’s very important to have a dialogue with farmers and the community.”  "
2qQMnWd,2017-06-05,Doctors debate safety of older babies sharing parents’ bedroom," (Reuters Health) - Babies may not get as much sleep in their parents’ bedrooms as they do in a room of their own, and they may also be more likely to go to bed in conditions associated with an increased risk of sleep-related deaths, a small U.S. study suggests.    At four months of age, nighttime and total sleep duration didn’t appear different based on whether babies slept in their own room or their parents’ bedroom, the survey of 230 mothers found. But babies who did sleep in their own room at this age got an average of 40 minutes more sleep a night by nine months of age than infants who were room-sharing this entire time.   “We know from prior research that babies experience brief awakenings overnight regardless of where they sleep,” said lead study author Dr. Ian Paul, chief of academic general pediatrics at Pennsylvania State College of Medicine in Hershey.    “Our research suggests that parents respond to these brief awakenings, which interrupts both parent and child sleep when they are room-sharing, but not as much when the baby is sleeping in a separate room,” Paul said by email. “This could set up a cycle where parents respond to the infant and then the infant grows to expect a parent response in order to get back to sleep.”   The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies sleep in the same room as their parents for at least the first six months of their lives, and ideally up to one year, to reduce the risk of SIDS. The safest place for infant sleep is on a firm surface such as a crib or bassinet without any soft bedding, bumpers or pillows – and not in their parents’ bed, the AAP guidelines stress.    Babies rooming with their parents at four months of age were more than twice as likely to have unsafe objects around them like blankets or pillows that increase the risk of sleep-related deaths, the study found. Infants in their parents’ rooms also had more than four times the odds of sleeping in their parents’ beds, another practice associated with an increased risk of SIDS.   These findings suggest AAP should reconsider its recommendation of continued room sharing up to one year of age, the authors conclude in Pediatrics.    The majority of the babies in the study - 62 percent - were already sleeping in their own room by four months of age, and another 27 percent of them made this transition by the time they were nine months old. About 11 percent of babies, however, were still room-sharing at nine months.    Babies were more likely to sleep in parents’ rooms when the mothers were single or not living with a partner, had less income or education, or had less space in their home to give the baby a separate room.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how babies’ sleep location influences safety or the duration or quality of sleep.    Beyond its small size, another limitation of the study is that some mothers were given information on reducing the risk of SIDS and recommendations on where babies should sleep, the authors note, though this didn’t appear to influence whether room-sharing occurred.    Previous studies have linked room-sharing to a reduced risk of SIDS, which may have to do with babies sleeping more lightly and being more arousable or waking more easily when their parents are nearby, said Dr. Rachel Moon, a SIDS researcher at the University of Virginia and an author of the AAP’s infant sleep recommendations.    “A leading hypothesis in SIDS causation is that failure to arouse makes the infant more vulnerable to dying from SIDS,” Moon, author of an editorial accompanying the current study, said by email.    Still, it’s concerning the study found room sharing linked to unsafe infant sleep practices like bed-sharing and using pillows and blankets, Moon added.   “Bed-sharing is strongly recommended against and therefore it is important that a recommended practice (i.e., room-sharing) not lead to a practice that is associated with greater potential harm (i.e., bed-sharing),” Moon said.

2sJ0jSG,2017-06-05,Stricter gun laws tied to fewer fatal police shootings," U.S. states with tighter restrictions on the purchase and use of guns and ammunitions may have fewer fatal police shootings than places with more permissive firearm policies, a recent study suggests.    The U.S. has more citizen-owned firearms than any other country in the world, but also some of the most relaxed gun laws, researchers note in the American Journal of Public Health.    For the current study, researchers examined data on citizens fatally shot by police or other law enforcement agencies to see how state laws on things like background checks for gun purchases, restrictions on carrying guns in public places and enhanced child and consumer safety policies might influence the odds of fatal police shootings.    Compared to states with the most permissive gun laws, states with the strictest firearm policies had 51 percent lower rates of fatal police shootings, the analysis found.    “Three types of laws in particular emerged as particularly important, including laws aimed at strengthening background checks, promoting safe gun storage, and curbing gun trafficking,” said lead study author Aaron Kivisto of the University of Indianapolis.    “Taken together, our findings suggest that background check laws appear to be associated with fewer shootings by law enforcement to the extent that they reduce the number of guns in the community, whereas laws aimed at promoting safe storage and curbing gun trafficking appear to reduce rates of police shootings by keeping guns already in the community from falling into the wrong hands,” Kivisto said by email.    The research team analyzed data from The Counted, a website that tracks police shootings using news reports and other sources, and from the Brady Center, an advocacy group for gun laws that tracks state firearm policies.    During 22 months in 2015 and 2016, there were 2,021 fatal police encounters in the U.S., and roughly 91 percent of these deaths involved firearms.    States ranged from a low of two fatal police shootings in Rhode Island and North Dakota to a high of 312 in California, with an average rate of roughly 3.5 fatal police shootings each year for every 100,000 people.    Nearly all of the victims were male and from racial or ethnic minority groups. About 53 percent of the victims were armed with guns at the time of the fatal police shooting, while 10 percent were unarmed.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how or if specific gun laws might directly help prevent fatal police shootings.    It’s also possible that states with stricter firearm policies might also have more rigorous training for police officers or more stringent hiring practices, or that states that are already safe are more likely to pass strict gun laws, the authors also note.    “However, based on the research literature, contrary to the common notion that people often talk about, reducing gun availability through more restrictive gun laws is actually a crucial step in reducing overall gun death including crime death,” said Ziming Xuan, a researcher at the Boston University School of Public Health who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Not only comprehensive background checks reduce gun death, certain laws intended to prevent prohibited high-risk individuals from accessing guns - including strong oversight and regulation of gun dealers, rigorous permit-to-purchase, and requirement of gun owners to report stolen or lost guns - provide added benefits of reducing diversion of guns to criminals,” Xuan said by email. “Specific prohibitions and procedures for high-risk persons including those under restraining orders due to domestic violence are associated with reduced rates of violence.”  "
2rJBmdb,2017-06-02,High school boys fear looking &#039;weak&#039; if they report concussions," (Reuters Health) - Male and female high school athletes have moderate levels of knowledge about concussion symptoms, but the boys are much more likely to not report concussions for fear of seeming weak, a small U.S. study suggests.   The reasons boys gave for not wanting to report a concussion tended to center around not wanting coaches or teammates to think they were weak or to “get mad,” researchers report in the Journal of Athletic Training.   “Although males and females have similar concussion symptom knowledge, we still see a negative stigma” with reporting them, lead author Jessica Wallace told Reuters Health by email.   “Especially within male dominated sports, we are seeing that many male athletes are not reporting because they are highly sensitive to how their peers and coaches view them,” said Wallace, an athletic trainer and researcher at Youngstown State University in Ohio.   Wallace thinks better concussion education programs are needed to teach kids the dangers of continuing to play with a concussion.   Concussion symptoms can include headache, dizziness and difficulty concentrating or sleeping. In all, 22 concussion symptoms are typically included in sport-related concussion education programs, the study team writes.   Athletes who continue to play with a concussion risk re-injury and a longer recovery time.   To determine how well high school athletes recognize these symptoms and how likely they are to report a concussion, as well as why they wouldn’t, the researchers enrolled 288 athletes (198 boys and 90 girls) at three Michigan high schools.     The participants answered a single survey that included a test of recognition of concussion symptoms. The survey also asked whether the student had ever experienced a concussion, how many concussions they had reported to a trainer, coach, parent or other authority figure, and reasons for not reporting the symptoms.    Of the 58 participants who had sustained a concussion, 25 reported having had two or more.   Knowledge of symptoms was similar between the sexes, with scores ranging from about 11 to 18 out of a possible 21 on the test.   The top reason for both boys and girls to not report a concussion was because they did not think it was serious. Other common reasons included not wanting to lose play time and not wanting to let the team down.    The boys were anywhere from four to 11 times less likely than girls to report concussions, for reasons having to do with how they were perceived by peers and coaches.   It is important for athletes, parents, and coaches to understand that concussion is a treatable injury, but “an athlete has to report the injury for it to be treated,” Wallace said.    “If an athlete fails to report the injury and continues to play while symptomatic, it can either delay recovery or potentially result in a catastrophic outcome,” she said. Coaches need to emphasize that concussions are serious and that reporting concussion symptoms is expected, Wallace added.   She suggests using a “buddy system” of reporting concussions. “Often, athletes will not report their own concussion, but they will be mindful and protective of their teammates. So the ‘buddy system’ would help me as the athletic trainer because the athletes would come and tell me if they thought their teammate/friend was experiencing a concussion or concussion symptoms,” she said.   “Studies such as these are building blocks to helping us understand how to provide effective and impactful interventions to help athletes better report their injuries,” said Zachary Kerr, an exercise and sport science researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.    “Barriers to concussion reporting by athletes need to be resolved, with an emphasis not only on education and knowledge, but also the pressures that athletes face from peers, adults, and their own perceptions,” said Kerr, who wasn’t involved in the study.

2syaqtm,2017-06-02,Clusters of teen births trigger public health questions," (Reuters Health) - Though the number of American teenagers having babies has dropped over the past half century, a new study finds regional clusters with strikingly high teen birth rates.    The clusters tended to be in southern states, with three of the top 10 in Texas, but they also popped up in Denver, Colorado; Fresno, California; and Yakima, Washington.    The number one urban center with a cluster was San Antonio, Texas, with an average birth rate for 15 to 19 year olds of 67 per 1,000, which was 87 percent higher than the average national teen birth rate.    The maps of teen-birth clusters shifted when investigators adjusted for poverty and lack of education, two factors researchers long ago identified as likely contributors to teen pregnancy.    After considering the effect of poverty, for example, San Antonio dropped from the top spot to the fifth, and after taking education level into account, San Antonio dropped out of the top 10, the study found.   After adjusting for lack of a high school diploma, Denver took the top spot with a cluster of teen births that showed the risk of a teenager having a baby more than twice as high as the average in the rest of the nation.    The map shifts reveal that factors other than poverty and lacking a high school degree contribute to regional clusters of high teen birth rates, said one of the study authors, Dr. Julie DeCesare, an obstetrician and professor at the University of Florida College of Medicine in Pensacola.   “We’ve focused on poverty and education, and maybe that’s worked thus far because overall we’re seeing a reduction in unintended pregnancy,” she said in a phone interview.    “But to get those rates lower, we’re going to have to look and see what’s contributing in our own communities,” she said. “What’s contributing in St. Louis may be different than what’s contributing in Kansas City.”   Using national data, the report in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology counted the number of 15- to 19-year-olds who gave birth by county between 2006 and 2012 and identified clusters of high rates in areas with more than 100,000 teenage females.   Children born to teen mothers are more likely to struggle academically, to be subjected to abuse, to be involved in crime and to experience developmental delays and depression, the authors write.    Only 51 percent of teenage mothers earned high school diplomas by age 22, compared with 89 percent of their peers without children, and 48 percent of teen mothers lived below the poverty line.   The research offers no answers to questions about which factors other than poverty and lack of education contribute to teenagers bearing children, DeCesare said.    “Our study doesn’t give any answers,” she said. “Our study only identifies the problem.”   Kathryn Kost, director of domestic research for the Guttmacher Institute in New York, suggested that access to sex education, contraception and abortion might be factors contributing to the teen-birth clusters.   “We have some clues,” said Kost, who was not involved in the new study. “Access to abortion might be playing into the variation in birth rates.”   “We also know that the variation in what’s available in sex education across the country is enormous,” she said.   One limitation of the study, Kost said, is that it examined only where teens are giving birth, not necessarily where they’re getting pregnant. She also pointed out that public health officials and policymakers might look at the maps with an eye toward preventing teen pregnancy, but she believes the maps also point to the need for support and resources for teen mothers.   “Whereas this study shows that access to services is not universally available in the United States, and there’s still a lot more we can do to help young women who don’t want to get pregnant, this study also shows there’s more we can do by paying attention to the young women who are giving birth to ensure they receive the support they need,” she said.   “Oftentimes we forget about those who have had the child, and they are deserving of attention and resources as well,” she said.   DeCesare said she and her colleagues now are examining the clusters to try to tease out what’s going on in those communities so that strategies can be developed to lower unintended teen birth rates.   “The message for policymakers is that if your city or your population center is on this list,” she said, “support local research into this problem so you can design some interventions that work to help reduce this teen birth rate.”  "
2qGf6Ba,2017-06-02,LGBQ students often go off-campus for mental health help," (Reuters Health) - Campus mental health services at colleges and universities may not be accessible enough to lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning and queer (LGBQ) students, a new study suggests.   Researchers found that LGBQ students in California were more likely to need and use mental health services than their heterosexual peers, but they were also more likely to seek that help off-campus.   “There may be opportunities for college campuses to dig into this and see if there are things that they could be doing to make services more welcoming and available to LGBQ students,” said senior author Dr. Bradley Stein, of the RAND Corporation in Pittsburgh.   The findings are drawn from online survey data collected for the California Mental Health Services Authority (CalMHSA) from 33,220 students at 33 colleges and universities in the state. All of the schools had formal on-campus mental health services.   “CalMHSA was particularly interested in . . . populations that may have different needs or greater needs,” Stein told Reuters Health.   LGBQ people experience depression more often and report needing mental health services more often than heterosexuals, he and his colleagues note in the Journal of Adolescent Health. The researchers didn’t include transgender students in the current study because of their unique mental health treatment issues.   Seven percent of the study participants identified as LGBQ.    Based on survey responses, about 26 percent of LGBQ students had serious psychological distress, such as feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, compared to about 18 percent of their heterosexual peers.   About 17 percent of LGBQ students were having academic problems due to severe mental health issues like stress and anxiety, compared to about 11 percent of heterosexual students.   Compared to heterosexuals, the LGBQ students were 87 percent more likely to use mental health services, and they were also more likely to use on-campus mental health services - but more of them also reported seeking mental health treatment off-campus.   When the researchers asked students what keeps them from using on-campus mental health services, LGBQ students were more likely than heterosexuals to report potential barriers, including concerns over confidentiality, embarrassment, costs and access.   Stein said previous research shows that merely providing mental health workers isn’t enough. “You need to have the clinicians to provide the service, but I don’t think you can stop there,” he said.   “We need to think about this all the way through, including how do we change the perception of these services being available, easy to use, accessible and meeting the needs of students,” he said.   Previously, using data from the same survey, Stein and colleagues found that providing mental health services to students makes sense economically.   Investments made by CalMHSA to improve mental health services on California campuses likely led to 329 additional college graduates, they found. The additional graduates’ lifetime earnings may result in a societal benefit of $56 million for each year of the organization’s investment, they estimated.   “The difference it makes to the trajectory of their life is not only so important to them, it also returns investment to society,” said Stein. “So, this could be a win-win.”  "
2rvMRUR,2017-06-02,Police violence linked to increased risk of suicide attempt," Being a victim of police violence is tied to a fourfold higher risk of suicide attempts for those who reported physical assault and a greater than tenfold higher risk for those who reported assault with a weapon or sexual victimization, U.S. researchers say.   “In the recent conversations about police violence, the focus has been on police killings or interactions that have resulted in death,” said lead study author Jordan DeVylder of the University of Maryland in Baltimore.   “That makes sense because those are the most impactful,” he told Reuters Health. “But if there are more than 1,000 incidents per year resulting in death, the less severe but still meaningful cases involving mental health effects have a far wider spread.”   In November 2016, the American Public Health Association urged increased research into the effects of law enforcement violence ( bit.ly/2qLcSLY ), the study team writes in the Journal of Urban Health   In response, DeVylder and colleagues conducted the Survey of Police-Public Encounters among 1,615 adults in four U.S. cities - Baltimore, New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. - who were selected to be representative of the general population.   The researchers collected information about participants’ gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, income, involvement in crime, past intimate partner and sexual victimization exposure and lifetime history of mental illness.    In addition, participants were asked about experiences of violence from law enforcement officers in any of five categories. For example, “has a police officer ever hit, punched, kicked, dragged, beat, or otherwise used physical force against you?” and “has a police officer ever used a gun, baton, taser, or other weapon against you?”  The researchers also asked about “forced inappropriate sexual contact,” non-physical aggression like threatening, intimidating or using slurs, and about abusive neglect: “have you ever called or summoned the police for assistance and the police either did not respond, responded too late, or responded inappropriately?   Participants were also asked if they had either thought about or attempted suicide in the past 12 months.    A total of 172 survey participants reported some type of police victimization and researchers found that these experiences were associated with higher odds of having made a suicide attempt, but not with suicidal thoughts. The risk was especially elevated when it was related to experiencing physical or sexual violence at the hands of police.   “What stuck out to us was the strength of the association,” DeVylder said. “Doubling or tripling the risk is considered strong, so four times or ten times the odds is a really powerful indicator.”   The research team is less clear about the direction of cause and effect, he added. Either the experience of victimization creates a psychological impact that leads to suicide attempts, or suicide attempts draw more police attention through emergency calls, which increases police encounters in general and can lead to negative circumstances.    It’s also possible that factors like various forms of social and economic adversity are common among people who are more likely to contemplate suicide and more likely to be exposed to police violence, the authors note. And thus the experience of victimization could contribute to the transition from suicidal thoughts to action.   DeVylder and colleagues plan to conduct a long-term study to understand these causality issues. Until that link is better researched, mental health resources can still fold the information into suicide prevention efforts, he said. The study team advocates suicide risk screening and assessing for police victimization, especially in cities.    “I would actually like to see these screens used not only by mental health service providers but also expanded to primary care settings, particularly in neighborhoods and communities where police contact is known or expected to be prevalent,” said Amanda Geller, a sociology researcher at New York University who wasn’t involved in the research.   The current study also didn’t include data about arrest history, incarceration history or childhood victimization exposure, which could influence the associations found, Geller noted.    “There’s a lot that remains to be learned about whether the health challenges we observe are direct effects of police contact or linked by some other mechanism,” Geller told Reuters Health by email. “But by documenting such a strong and significant association between police victimization and suicide attempts, they raise a flag that the consequences could be dire.”  "
2rFNGeL,2017-06-01,Breastfeeding linked to lower endometrial cancer risk," (Reuters Health) - Women who breastfeed their babies for the recommended six months may also be lowering their own risk of developing endometrial cancer, a new study suggests.                    A mother and baby attend a breastfeeding contest organized by Peru's Health Ministry in Lima, Peru, August 26, 2016. REUTERS/Mariana Bazo       In the analysis of data from 17 past studies, researchers found that women who had ever breastfed their children were 11 percent less likely than women who had children but didn’t breastfeed to be diagnosed with endometrial cancer.   Longer breastfeeding seemed to further lower endometrial cancer risk, though there was little extra benefit past 6-9 months of breastfeeding, the study team reports in Obstetrics and Gynecology.   “Cancer of the uterus is becoming more common and we need to try to prevent it,” said lead author Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, Australia.    Endometrial cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women in high-income countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer.   “The more women know about the things they can do to reduce their risks of future cancer diagnoses, the better,” Jordan said by email. “Although this piece of evidence by itself may not convince women to breastfeed, it contributes to the overall picture of health gains that can come from breastfeeding.”   The World Health Organization recommends that women exclusively breastfeed for the first six months of their baby’s life, then continue breastfeeding even after beginning to introduce solid foods.    The researchers analyzed pooled data from studies participating in the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium, including 10 from the United States and others from Canada, Europe, China and Australia. They looked at more than 26,000 women who had ever had a child, whether they breastfed, and for how long. This included about 9,000 women with endometrial cancer.    After accounting for other factors that can influence endometrial cancer risk, including age, race, education, oral contraceptive use, menopausal status, years since last pregnancy and body mass index (BMI), researchers found the apparent protective effect of breastfeeding remained.   Notably, the risk reduction linked to breastfeeding was 28 percent among women born after 1950, but negligible among those born before 1950, which may reflect differences in breastfeeding practices, they study authors note. In the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, for example, breastfeeding rates were much lower than in recent decades, the authors note.   The study doesn’t prove that breastfeeding helps to protect against endometrial cancer, but it’s plausible, the authors write, because the growth of this type of cancer is stimulated by estrogen, which is suppressed during breastfeeding.   “The message is not only relevant for women making decisions about breastfeeding but also for society to understand the benefits so we can support women to breastfeed for reasonably long periods of time,” Jordan told Reuters Health. “However, it’s not always possible for women to breastfeed, so it should also be noted that just because a woman chooses not to or can’t breastfeed, it doesn’t mean she’ll go on to develop cancer.”   “Breastfeeding seems to significantly reduce the risk, but further studies originating in other countries are required to assess the association,” said Lianlian Wang of The Fourth Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University in Shenyang, China, who was not involved with the study.   For instance, the most recent endometrial cancer report produced by the World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research in 2013 classified the evidence for a benefit from breastfeeding as “limited-no conclusion.”   Jordan and colleagues are working with international collaborators to investigate the effects of breastfeeding on ovarian cancer risk. They’re also researching other factors that may influence the risk of endometrial cancer, including specific medications.   “Breastfeeding has consistently been found to be associated with reduced risk of breast cancer,” Jordan pointed out. “This provides evidence of another long-term health benefit for women who breastfeed for more than six months.”  "
2qKYOSB,2017-06-01,Strict bedtime rules can help kids get enough sleep," (Reuters Health) - Parents who stick to a set bedtime schedule and enforce rules for nighttime routines may be more likely to have children who get enough sleep during the week than people who are more relaxed about putting kids to bed, a recent Canadian study suggests.    Under Canadian sleep guidelines, children aged 5 to 13 should get at least nine hours of sleep a night and teens aged 14 to 17 should get at least eight hours. For the study, researchers examined survey data from 1,622 parents with at least one child in these age ranges and found kids were 59 percent more likely to meet these minimum sleep guidelines during the week when parents enforced a set bedtime than when they didn’t do this.    “The positive effect of enforcing bedtime rules on weekdays may reflect broader parental expectations, bedtime structure or the proactive nature of rule-setting,” said senior study author Dr. Heather Manson of Public Health Ontario in Toronto.    Just encouraging kids by reminding them about bedtimes may not work the way parents expect it to, the study also found. When parents relied on reminders about bedtime without enforcing the rules, children were 71 percent less likely to get the minimum recommended amount of sleep during the week.   “On weekdays, bedtime rule enforcement, not encouragement, was conducive to children achieving sufficient sleep,” Manson said by email.    Depending on the age of the child, the proportion of parents reporting that their child met the Canadian sleep guidelines ranged from about 68 percent to 93 percent on weekdays and from 49 percent to 86 percent on weekends.    The number of children getting the minimum recommended amount of sleep increased from ages 5 to 9 but then declined from age 10 to 17, according to the results published in BMC Public Health.    Fifteen-year-olds had the biggest variation between weekday and weekend sleep, with 38 percent fewer kids getting the minimum recommended amount of rest on weekends than on weekdays.    Overall, about 94 percent of parents reported encouraging their child to go to bed at a specific time, and roughly 84 percent reported enforcing bedtime rules.    The study found rule enforcement more effective than simple reminders even after adjusting for other factors like the age and sex of the child, household income, parental education and other rules such as restricting screen time or use of technology in the bedroom.    One limitation of the study is that it relied on parents to accurately recall and report on their approach to bedtime routines and the amount of sleep kids got. It didn’t include any objective measures of sleep duration or quality, and it wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how specific parenting behaviors might directly impact children’s sleep.    Previous research has found that parents’ consistency with enforcing rules about bedtime and media use is critical for good sleep outcomes, said Michelle Garrison of Seattle Children’s Research Institute and the University of Washington.    While parents may drive all aspects of these routines for babies, they can start to involve kids in the process more as children age to help them develop healthy independent sleep habits, Garrison, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. This might mean reading to toddlers every night but letting them choose the book, for example, or allowing teens to choose what relaxing activities will help them prepare for bed.    “The parent may still have responsibility for getting the routine started at the same time each night and helping the child learn to practice self-monitoring to see if they are on track in terms of both time and in calming down before bed,” Garrison said.    “As they continue to move towards adulthood, the idea is to keep gradually shifting more of this to the child so that they have the opportunity to practice and grow these skills,” Garrison added. “But with enough structure and support so that we aren’t expecting them to have the self-regulation of an adult.”  "
2qvmaLE,2017-05-31,Acne antibiotic delays development of multiple sclerosis in small trial," (Reuters Health) - An inexpensive antibiotic used to fight acne appears to delay the development of multiple sclerosis in people in the earliest stage of the crippling disease, according to a Canadian study.   Treatment with the generic tetracycline drug minocycline produced fewer cases of MS after six months compared to people given a placebo. The drug was tested in 142 patients who had shown some early symptoms, but the disease had not been confirmed.   The benefit was also seen after one year of therapy, but not after two years, said chief author Dr. Luanne Metz of the University of Calgary’s Hotchkiss Brain Institute.    “We did not have enough patients at 24 months to know whether the drug was still doing anything or not,” she told Reuters Health. Further tests would be ideal but paying for them will be difficult because no pharmaceutical company stands to make a lot of money from this use for the generic drug.   Generally, two out of three patients with the early signs of multiple sclerosis, known as clinically isolated syndrome, go on to develop MS within six months. The disease attacks the insulation protecting the body’s nerves.   In the new study, the six-month risk of conversion to MS was 33.4 percent with 100 mg of minocycline twice daily versus 61.0 percent in the placebo group. When the researchers adjusted for the results of MRI scans, the odds rose to 43.0 percent with minocycline but stayed the same with placebo.   Yet after two years, the unadjusted risk was comparable in the two groups, raising the possibility that the benefit may not last.    The treatment costs about C$600 ($444) per year in Canada versus C$20,000 to C$40,000 for conventional MS therapy, the researchers said. The price tag is about three times higher in the United States. In addition, minocycline therapy can be started rapidly. In Canada, conventional MS therapy can take months to get approved.   “It’s a very inexpensive medication - less than C$2 per day - that can be initiated immediately,” coauthor Wee Yong told Reuters Health. “We know that time matters in MS. With the passage of time, the immune insults on the brain continue. I see this as potentially a game-changer in terms of overcoming the challenges of time against MS.”   In addition, the drug could help patients in areas of the world that don’t have access to the more expensive drugs for multiple sclerosis, he said.   “Overall, the findings from this trial suggest a potential clinical benefit of minocycline in early multiple sclerosis, with an effect size similar to that of existing disease-modifying treatments,” said Drs. Zongqi Xia of the Pittsburgh Institute of Neurodegenerative Diseases and Robert Friedlander of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in an editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the study appears.   Despite some limitations, including the small size of the study, the findings “make a compelling case for the further study of the effect of minocycline in multiple sclerosis,” they said. “However, use of minocycline in multiple sclerosis is not supported until its benefit can be confirmed in larger long-term clinical trials.”   According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, people who experience neurologic symptoms for at least 24 hours and those symptoms are caused by a inflammation or a loss of myelin in the central nervous system may - but not always - progress to MS.   The odds are about 60 percent to 80 percent when MRI detects MS-like brain lesions; about 20 percent when they’re not seen.   In the new test, done at 12 Canadian MS clinics, all volunteers had at least two brains lesions larger than 3 millimeters. The study team used minocycline because it has anti-inflammatory properties and, unlike most drugs, it crosses the blood-brain barrier.   Among the minocycline side effects: dizziness (seen 10 times more often than in the placebo group), rash (which was 5 times more common) and dental discoloration (seen in 6 of 72 patients but none in the 70-member placebo group).   Six people in the minocycline group withdrew from the test because of side effects versus one person in the placebo group.   “Most people stay on it and tolerate it very well,” Metz said. Side effects usually fade over time to the point where “it’s tolerated much like taking a vitamin pill.”  "
2rciUsr,2017-05-31,Why parents&#039; tech obsession may mean kids misbehave," (Reuters Health) - Parents who are constantly checking their phones for texts, emails and cat videos may be more likely to have kids who misbehave than people who are able to step away from their screens, a small U.S. study suggests.                     FILE PHOTO: A man uses a smartphone in New York City, in this picture taken November 6, 2013.  REUTERS/Mike Segar           Researchers examined survey data from parents in 170 families with young children and found mothers and fathers who were more likely to report being distracted by technology during playtime were also more likely to see behavior problems in their kids.     “Prior studies have shown us that some parents can be quite absorbed by their devices and that when they are absorbed it seems like it is difficult for children to get their attention,” said lead study author Brandon McDaniel of Illinois State University in Normal.   “No prior studies however had linked parent technology use, especially use that interrupts or interferes with parent-child interactions, with child behavior problems specifically,” McDaniel added by email. “What is especially new here is that even minor, everyday intrusions of technology that are likely happening to all of us that have and use smartphones can begin to influence our children’s behavior.”   For the study, researchers analyzed data from surveys completed separately by 168 mothers and 165 fathers from two-parent households.    Among other things, the surveys asked about how often smartphones, tablets, laptops and other technology disrupted family time with interruptions like checking phone messages during meals or answering texts in the middle of conversations. Parents were also asked to rate how problematic their personal device use was based on how often they worried about calls or texts and whether they thought they used mobile devices too much.    While both mothers and fathers thought technology use distracted from interactions with their children at least once a day, the women perceived their phone use as a bigger parenting problem than the men.   About 48 percent of parents reported technology interruptions at least three times a day, while 24 percent said this happened twice a day and 17 percent said it occurred once daily. Only 11 percent said technology never interrupted family time, the study team reports in Child Development.    Researchers also asked parents to rate the frequency of child behavior issues within the past two months by answering questions about how often their children whined, sulked, easily got frustrated, had tantrums or showed signs of hyperactivity or restlessness.   After adjusting for other factors that can influence kids’ behavior such as parent income and education level and other family dynamics, researchers found an association between parents’ belief that their technology use was disruptive and parents reporting that kids had behavior issues like tantrums, whining or hyperactivity.    The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how or if parents’ technology use changes the way kids behave. Other limitations include the lack of clinical data or reports from teachers or other adults to verify that kids had behavior problems.   It’s also possible that parents who turn to technology more often during family time are doing this to take a break from kids with behavior issues, said Dr. Sam Wass, a developmental psychologist at the University of East London in the UK who wasn’t involved in the study.    “It could be that children who are naturally more restless or hyperactive are more likely to have parents who ‘need a break’ from their children from time to time - and it is this that causes the association,” Wass said by email. “This link is very far from proven.”   Still, parents worried about how technology disrupts their family time can try to carve out periods of each day when the devices go away and they focus only on their kids, said Larry Rosen, professor emeritus at California State University, Dominguez Hills.    “Children crave a connection to their parents and learn from their parents’ behaviors,” Rosen, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Constantly checking your phone is going to have a negative impact on this connection.”  "
2r1Jc0X,2017-05-31,Wasted food adds up to wasted nutrients," Foods that wind up in the trash contain many of the same nutrients that Americans are missing in their diets, suggests a new study.   About 30 to 40 percent of food produced in the United States is wasted - the equivalent of 1,250 to 1,400 calories per person per day. Also being tossed out is the equivalent of one quarter of the recommended daily fiber intake for most women, for example, or enough fiber to meet the full requirement for 74 million women, the authors point out.   “When we discard food, we’re also discarding a lot of healthy nutrients. And many of these are nutrients lacking in the average American diet,” lead author Marie Spiker told Reuters Health in an email.   “The most perishable foods, and the ones that we’re most likely to throw away - vegetables, fruits and seafood - are also some of the most nutritious,” said Spiker, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland.   Spiker and her colleagues used U.S. Department of agriculture data to calculate the nutritional value of foods in 213 categories that were wasted, both at the retail level and in homes, during 2012.   They found that nationwide, wasted food contained an estimated 1,200 calories, as well as 146 grams of carbohydrate, 33 g of protein, 6 g of fiber, 286 milligrams of calcium, 2 mg of vitamin D and 900 mg of potassium per person per day, among other nutrients.    Using dietary fiber as an example, the authors point out that 6 g is 23 percent of the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for women, adding that U.S. women tend to fall short of their recommended fiber intake by 8.9 g a day.    Men have an even bigger fiber shortfall of 17.7 g daily, so the fiber in wasted food would fill that gap for 205 million women or 106 million men, according to the report in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.   “Food recovery programs, which save food from being wasted and make it available through purchase or donation, are an important piece of the solution. But it’s also important to remember that only a portion of food that’s currently discarded can realistically be recovered, due to food safety concerns and logistical constraints,” Spiker said.   So strategies that work at multiple levels, especially strategies that prevent food from being wasted in the first place, are needed, she said. “Efforts like standardized date labeling and consumer education can go a long ways toward preventing food waste in the first place.”   Consumers also shouldn’t underestimate the impact of wasting less food at home, she said. “One way of reducing household food waste is to get familiar with your refrigerator: know what’s in the fridge before you go shopping, move older items to the front and center so you’ll remember to incorporate them into meals, and remember that many items can be frozen.”    The results provide “a very useful reminder of just the sheer magnitude of food wastage in the United States,” said John Hoddinott, a food and nutrition economics and policy researcher at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.    They remind us that not only is there calorie loss, but there is loss of really high quality food, said Hoddinott, who wasn’t involved in the study.   The authors are right in saying that if some of this food could be made available to food insecure households, that might potentially go a long way in terms of reducing hunger and food insecurity in the United States, he said.   “Doing so, however, is enormously difficult in terms of the logistics in actually making such food available and ensuring it’s of a suitable quality for people to consume,” Hoddinott said.   Even so, reductions in food wastage could be one way to bring down the costs associated with these foods, which typically tend to be higher in price and often outside the reach of very poor consumers, he said.    “So, efforts to reduce food wastage can have both direct effects, in terms of making these foods available, and also indirect effects to making them more affordable,” he said.  "
2qxzVdI,2017-05-30,Most doctors and nurses don’t know what ER care costs," Less than half of doctors and nurses working in emergency rooms know what some of the conditions they see most often cost to treat, a recent U.S. study suggests.    Researchers asked 441 emergency medicine clinicians to estimate the cost of care for three common scenarios: a 35-year old woman with abdominal pain, a 57-year old man with labored breathing and a 7-year old boy with a sore throat. Each case included a medical history, results from physical exams and lab tests as well as a rundown of any treatments provided.    Then, researchers asked participants to choose one of four price ranges for each scenario: less than $2,000; $2,001 to $4,000; $4,001 to $6,000 or $6,001 to $8,000.    Just 32 percent of respondents got the right price range for the scenario of the man with labored breathing, which cost $2,423. Only 40 percent of clinicians picked the correct price range for the kid with a sore throat, whose cost was $596, while 43 percent of participants chose the right price range for the case of the woman with abdominal pain that had charges of $4,713.    “We continue to have poor understanding of the costs of routine care in the emergency department,” said lead study author Dr. Kevin Hoffman, an emergency medicine resident at Lakeland Health in Saint Joseph, Michigan.   “Medical decisions should never be made based only on the cost associated with them,” Hoffman said by email. “However, when there is more than one way to effectively treat a patient, the more cost efficient choice should be chosen.”   To see how well clinicians understand the cost of emergency care, researchers emailed surveys to doctors, physicians in training known as residents, nurse practitioners and physician assistants currently working in U.S. emergency departments.    The billing department at Lakeland Health determined the cost of care and the correct price ranges for each scenario.    The accuracy of responses didn’t vary based on where in the country the participants worked or the level of training or experience they had, researchers report in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association.    Participants did tend to estimate higher costs for care when they worked at larger hospitals, however.    Costs for the woman with abdominal pain, who was obese and also complained of fever and chills, included a range of lab and imaging tests as well as drugs for pain, nausea and vomiting. Her symptoms went away and she was sent home.    The man with breathing difficulties had a history of heart failure and swelling in his lower extremities. He got a variety of tests to assess heart and lung function and received drugs for fluid buildup associated with heart failure.   For the sore throat, the boy had a positive strep test and went home with antibiotics.    One limitation of the study is the way researchers asked about costs, the authors note. The survey asked: “What is the total cost of the care delivered in the following scenario?”    Even though researchers intended this to reflect what the patient would be charged for care provided, it’s possible participants might have interpreted the question as asking about the costs charged to the hospital, the researchers note. This is kind of like the difference between the sticker price of a used car and what consumers actually pay after negotiating with the dealer.    Still, helping clinicians better understand costs might help lower out-of-pocket fees for patients and curb overall health spending, the authors conclude.    This is particularly true for emergency care, when patients don’t have the luxury of shopping around for the most affordable option based on their particular insurance situation, said Dr. Eric Beck, president and chief executive of Evolution Health in Dallas, Texas.    “We cannot understand value in healthcare, pursue cost-effective care or be good stewards of resources without understanding the cost of care,” Beck, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   “Rarely is there an alternative or immediately available alternative or option to defer care delivered in the ER,” Beck said. “The real importance here is ensuring medically appropriate, medically necessary care and services from an evidence-based perspective, balanced with the sensitivity to cost of care.”  "
2rBYV7I,2017-05-30,Severe birth complications more common with older mothers," (Reuters Health) - Women who are at least 35 years old when they give birth are much more likely than younger mothers to experience a variety of major pregnancy complications, a recent study confirms.    While previous research has linked what’s known as advanced maternal age to problems like high blood pressure and diabetes during pregnancy and a higher risk of death and severe complications for babies, the current study offers fresh insight into the severe health issues faced by older mothers, said lead study author Dr. Sarka Lisonkova.   “This is important for counseling women who contemplate delaying childbirth to their forties,” Lisonkova, of the University of British Columbia Children’s and Women’s Health Center in Vancouver, said by email. “While a delay of childbirth by a few years does not make a large difference in the early thirties, a few years delay in the late forties increases the risks significantly.   For the study, researchers examined data on all singleton births to 828,269 women in Washington State from 2003 to 2013.    After adjusting for other factors that can influence pregnancy outcomes like whether it’s a first-time pregnancy or if women are obese or used assistive reproductive technology, researchers compared age-specific rates of maternal death and severe complications like obstetric shock or amniotic fluid entering the mother’s bloodstream.    Compared with mothers aged 25 to 29, women aged 35 to 39 were 20 percent more likely to have severe complications, and the odds were more than quintupled for women 50 and older, researchers report in PLoS Medicine.    Women 35 and older were also eight times more likely to have amniotic fluid enter their bloodstream, a complication that can cause a life-threatening allergic reaction, the study found.    Mothers 40 and older were almost 16 times more likely to have kidney failure and almost three times more likely to have obstetric shock, when organs don’t get enough blood and oxygen, the study found. These women were also almost five times more likely to either have complications from interventions done to help deliver the baby or be admitted to intensive care units.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove how maternal age directly influences the odds of complications. Researchers also didn’t have enough cases to determine how age directly influences maternal deaths.    Even so, the findings add to evidence linking advanced maternal age to a higher risk of problems for mothers and babies, said Dr. Nanette Santoro, a researcher at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Aurora who wasn’t involved in the study.    While many of these problems can be managed surgically, the study highlights some rare complications that are harder to treat and can be fatal like renal failure and amniotic fluid entering the bloodstream, Santoro said by email.    “Based on this study and others, the ideal age to get pregnant is between 25 and 29 years,” Santoro said. “Since we’ve just entered the first era in human history where the U.S. birth rate is higher for women aged 30 to 35 than for women aged 25 to 29, we will be seeing more aged-related risks to women who conceive at later ages.”  "
2rVN8xU,2017-05-30,Older adults might be able to stave off arthritis knee pain with fiber," Older people who eat the most fiber are at lower risk of developing knee pain and stiffness due to osteoarthritis (OA), new research shows.   Diets rich in fiber from plant-based foods have clear health benefits, such as lower cholesterol, better-controlled blood sugar, and a healthier weight, but most people in the U.S. don’t eat enough fiber, lead author Dr. Zhaoli Dai of Boston University School of Medicine told Reuters Health.    The current average fiber intake among U.S. adults is about 15 grams, she noted. “This is far below the recommended level, which is 22.4 grams for women and 28 grams per day for men 51 years and above,” Dai said.   OA, which occurs when wear and tear on the joints degrades cartilage and leads to bone abnormalities, is extremely common in people 60 and older. It can be painful, and is also a leading cause of disability. There is no treatment for OA, aside from joint replacement, and therapies to address symptoms, such as anti-inflammatories for pain and swelling.   Given that dietary fiber is known to help prevent obesity and reduce inflammation, both of which are associated with arthritis, Dai’s team looked at diet and arthritis risk over time in two study groups. In the Osteoarthritis Initiative, which included 4,796 men and women with OA or at risk for OA, people who consumed the most dietary fiber at the start of the study were 30 percent less likely than those who ate the least fiber to develop knee pain, stiffness or swelling due to OA, or to worsening of OA, during four years of follow-up.   In the Framingham Offspring Study, which included 1,268 adults in their early 50s, on average, the top quarter of fiber consumers had a 61 percent lower risk of knee OA symptoms nine years later than the bottom quarter.   There are many mechanisms through which increased fiber intake could help ease knee arthritis symptoms, Dai said, for example by reducing inflammation and helping people to maintain a healthy weight. Fiber can also act as a pre-biotic, she added, meaning that it can help fuel the growth of beneficial microbes in the gut, which in turn also reduces inflammation.   “This is the first study to show that consuming more dietary fiber is related to lower risk of painful knee osteoarthritis,” Dai said. “Changing diets by increasing intake of dietary fiber seems to be one of the most economic ways to reduce the risk of knee osteoarthritis.”    Older adults, especially those who are overweight or obese, should consider increasing their fiber intake, she added.

2qgXKq2,2017-05-29,Injury rates in young female athletes may be underestimated," Injury rates among elite young female athletes may be higher than what’s been reported, new data suggest.   “Most studies define injury as time loss from participation, whereas many athletes with overuse injuries continue to participate despite pain and reduced performance. When time-loss definitions are used, about 90 percent of overuse injuries appear to be missed,” researchers write in the journal BMJ Open Sport and Exercise Medicine.   Angelo Richardson of Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences in The Netherlands and colleagues studied 60 young women who competed at the national or international level in soccer, basketball or gymnastics. The average age of the study participants was 17.    Every two weeks during the 2014-2015 season, the athletes filled out questionnaires that asked about health problems, including not just new injuries but also overuse injuries, which occur over time as a result of repeated stresses on tissues, bones and joints.    Overall, at any given time during the study, 48 percent of the athletes reported injuries, the authors found. And every two weeks, nearly 61 percent of the athletes were reporting some sort of health problem - either injury or illness.   Put another way, if a thousand athletes such as these were to participate in their sports for an hour, nine of them would sustain an injury, the researchers said. By comparison, a 2016 study of high school soccer players in the U.S. found that if a thousand of them were to practice or play soccer for an hour, only two would sustain an injury – with only a slight difference between girls and boys.    Injury rates were similar for all three sports. But when it came to “substantial” injuries, the soccer and basketball players were at higher risk, with rates of roughly 28 percent in each group, compared to the gymnasts, whose rate of substantial injuries was 16 percent.   The high prevalence of self-reported injuries among these talented female athletes suggests that efforts toward prevention are needed, the authors wrote.   “I believe this study provides some real value to what we know as health care providers who work in sport,” athletic trainer Scott Sailor, who is president of the National Athletic Trainers’ Association, told Reuters Health in an email.   “Often the data we have deals with time loss injuries and the majority of injuries athletic trainers treat on a daily basis are non-time loss,” said Sailor, who was not involved in the study.   It’s crucial that athletes be appropriately prepared for the demands of the sport, Sailor said. This involves making sure they have adequate strength and flexibility, but it goes beyond that, to making sure they have appropriate movement patterns - that the way they run, jump, lunge, land, etc. is efficient and effective so that they don’t get their joint in a position where their body can’t protect them from injuring tissues, he said.   “Working with athletic trainers or other sports medicine professionals can provide added benefit and ensure proper form, movement and reduced risk of injury. Equally important is ensuring our athletes have adequate nutrition, hydration and rest,” he said.   Failing to do these things predisposes the athlete to injury and illness, he added.   “Most training for athletes has now transitioned from maximum lifts in the gym to functional exercises that train sport-specific movement patterns,” said Lawrence Spriet, a researcher in the Department of Human Health and Nutritional Sciences at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, in email to Reuters Health.    “Ensuring that athletes fuel properly through their diet, have consistent warm-ups and cool-downs before and after exercise, and use individualized training protocols can all assist in injury prevention,” said Spriet, who wasn’t involved in the study.   It is not uncommon for athletes to sustain injuries but it is essential to try to prevent injuries that cause time-loss from training and competition, decrease performance levels, and that can become chronic if not treated properly, Spriet added.   “Seeking treatment at the onset of complaints or injury will help avoid this,” he said.   "
2qwWxu2,2017-05-29,Likelihood of having current CPR training declines with age," Older people are the group most likely to need cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but they are the least likely to have training in the life-saving technique, according to new findings.   “This mismatch may translate into lives lost, because if someone collapses at home who is 65 years old and their 62-year-old spouse does not know CPR, they have to wait for the ambulance to arrive and it may be too late,” said Dr. Benjamin S. Abella, who directs the Center for Resuscitation Science at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. “We need to be more creative about our approach to CPR training in this population.”   Receiving prompt CPR from a bystander more than doubles a person’s chances of surviving a sudden cardiac arrest, but fewer than one-third of sudden cardiac arrest victims receive bystander CPR, Abella and his team noted in a report in the Journal of the American Heart Association. To better understand low rates of bystander CPR, Abella and his colleagues surveyed a nationally representative sample of about 9,000 U.S. adults on their CPR training status.   Just 18 percent had current training in CPR, while 65 percent said they had received training in the past. The older a study participant was, the less likely he or she was to have current CPR training, or to have ever received CPR training. People with a graduate school education or higher were more than three times as likely have current CPR training. However, lower education and lower household income were both associated with not having received CPR training.   Traditionally, people get certified to perform CPR by attending classes sponsored by the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross, often at universities, schools or hospitals. CPR certification is time-consuming, and can be expensive, Abella told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.   “There’s an important mantra in resuscitation, which is ‘something is better than nothing,’” he added. New ways to teach CPR, he suggested, might be through training offered by video at places where people are going to be waiting anyhow, like the department of motor vehicles, the airport, or the doctor’s office.   “Breaking outside of the classroom and the traditional model of CPR training is going to be important,” Abella said. “There are many locations where we can bring CPR to the public, as opposed to asking the public to come find ways to learn CPR.”   More information about CPR training in the U.S. or worldwide is available from the American Heart Association, here:  bit.ly/19Wb4pT.   "
2qsiAGM,2017-05-29,The trauma of a breast cancer diagnosis can have cognitive effects," The mental fog often experienced by breast cancer patients after chemotherapy might be due more to post-traumatic stress than to the cancer drugs, a new study suggests.    “Patients who complain of cognitive problems may actually suffer from post-traumatic stress or other substantial psychological consequences of having cancer, which can be treated,” Dr. Kerstin Hermelink from CCCLMU University Hospital of Munich, Germany told Reuters Health by email.    “Physicians should therefore attentively listen to their patients who complain of cognitive impairment and try to understand their individual situation to find out what the patient needs,” she added.   The effects of chemotherapy on the brain have been blamed for the “brain fog” sometimes experienced by women with breast cancer, but similar symptoms have been reported by breast cancer patients who haven’t started their chemo yet and even by those whose treatment didn’t include chemotherapy, Hermelink and colleagues noted in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.   To investigate, the researchers studied 150 women who had just been diagnosed with breast cancer, as well as 56 women without any health problems.    At several points during the following year, the women completed neuropsychological tests, as well as evaluations for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). They also gave their own assessments of their cognitive function.   About seven months into the study (and about two months after completion of chemotherapy for the women who received it), there were no differences in cognitive performance or cognitive changes between women who received chemotherapy, women whose breast cancer was not treated with chemotherapy, and the healthy women without breast cancer.   At the end of one year, however, there was a small decline in the breast cancer patients compared to the healthy women, but the decline did not depend on chemotherapy treatment, according to the research team. Instead, it was linked with PTSD symptoms.   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines PTSD as “an intense physical and emotional response to thoughts and reminders of the event that last for many weeks or months after the traumatic event.” Symptoms are varied and include - but are not limited to - flashbacks, nightmares, difficulty sleeping, being overly alert or easily startled, and having trouble concentrating.   “I personally was surprised how little cognitive change we observed,” Hermelink said. “All differences between the two patient groups and the control group were minimal, even though we used a large test battery and our study was comparatively well-powered, with a large sample.”   “Physicians should tell their patients that very subtle cognitive impairment is not only observed after chemotherapy but also in patients treated without chemotherapy, and even in patients who have not yet started any treatment for breast cancer at all,” she said. “The brain is not a machine that delivers the same level of performance as long as it is not broken but its function - and in the long run also its structure - are affected by our actions and experiences. The diagnosis of a life-threatening illness like breast cancer comes as a shock to most patients, which may leave traces in the brain, even if they cope very well.”    Hermelink added, “Research on cognitive impairment associated with cancer is full of methodological pitfalls that can substantially distort the results. It is almost impossible for people who do not work in the field to assess the methodological quality of a study and thus to find out whether or not the results are valid. Studies with spectacular findings are relatively easy to publish, even if they are small and their methods questionable, and of course all researchers need to publish. Journalists and the public should therefore be particularly wary of small studies with large and unambiguous effects.”  "
2r5eKRa,2017-05-26,Tremors tied to recreational drugs can linger in former users," (Reuters Health) - - Recreational drugs like “MDMA” and amphetamines have long been linked to a variety of movement disorders, and a new study suggests that basic motor skill impairment may linger even among former users.    For the study, researchers tested how well current and former amphetamine users could hold their arms in a variety of positions, an indicator of basic motor skills, and compared their abilities to people who had never used these drugs. Both drooping arms and tremors were more common in current stimulant users than in people who never used the drugs. Former users also had more tremors than non-users.    “Holding your arms out for one minute should not be seen as difficult - yet regular stimulants users showed significant deficits in this very simple and basic human skill,” said senior study author Andrew Parrott of Swansea University in the UK.   “It was previously known that regular central nervous system stimulant use could damage fine motor skills,” Parrott said by email. “In our study, we found that very basic psychomotor skills were also impaired.”   Stimulants work by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine is a chemical linked to pleasure, movement and attention. Stimulants like Adderall, Ritalin and Concerta are often prescribed to children and adults diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. While tremors are a side effect associated with stimulants, this side effect is less likely with lower doses and short-term use.    Recreational users may take much bigger doses of stimulants like cocaine or ecstasy or MDMA that increase dopamine levels too much and permanently damage neurons in the brain, said Jason White, head of the School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences at the University of South Australia.   “The damage to neurons produced by stimulants has the potential to adversely affect movement, and evidence is now accumulating that this does occur and at least some of the changes may be permanent,” White, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “This can lead to alterations in normal motor function but may also reflect an increased risk of developing movement disorders later in life.”   For the study, researchers tested motor skills of 20 current stimulant users, 20 former users and 20 people who had never tried these drugs recreationally. Participants were asked to hold their dominant arm in ten different positions while sitting or standing and hold it for a minute, sometimes with their eyes closed.    In all ten positions, the current stimulant users had more tremors than the non-users, researchers report in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology. Former stimulant users had more tremors in several positions.   When people quit stimulants, tremors persisted for at least 18 months of abstinence, the study also found.    Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the potential for cigarette smoking or marijuana use across all three groups in the study to influence the results, the authors note. Researchers also relied on participants to accurately report on any current or former drug use; they didn’t do drug tests to confirm whether people were currently using stimulants or if they had quit.    Because the study focused on only some of the most popular recreational stimulants, it’s also possible that side effects would be different for other drugs, said Dr. Fabrizio Schifano of the University of Hertfordshire in the U.K.    Still, the results add to several decades of research on the lasting side effects of stimulants for former users, most of which has focused on psychological and cognitive effects, Schifano, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “This study is novel and interesting because it deals, under strict and controlled laboratory conditions, with the possible long-term impairment of motor skills in current and previous stimulant users,” Schifano said. “One would also consider that typical users of stimulants and especially MDMA/ecstasy are youngsters and arguably in the best possible physical condition, and still levels of motor skills impairment were identified.”  "
2r0mLXW,2017-05-25,How good are activity trackers at counting calories burned?," People who wear activity trackers to count the calories they’re burning are probably not getting accurate estimates, suggests a new study.   Researchers who tested seven popular activity trackers found that while heart rate measurements were generally accurate, none of the devices provided a reliable calorie count.   “At this point with this level of error, I would be wary of using that estimate to alter a calorie-controlled diet,” said senior author Dr. Euan Ashley, of Stanford University in California.   Patients “have been bringing data from these devices to us and some of us were using these devices ourselves,” Ashley told Reuters Health.    Because so little is known about the data’s accuracy, “We realized that we had to do our own study,” he said.   Ashley’s team recruited 60 healthy adults to test seven popular wrist-worn activity trackers: the Apple Watch, Basis Peak, Fitbit Surge, Microsoft Band, MIO Alpha 2, PulseOn and Samsung Gear S2.   Participants wore up to four devices at a time, and they also wore laboratory devices to measure heart rate and calories burned while sitting, walking, running and cycling.   All of the devices but one had an average heart rate error rate below 5 percent. The exception was the Samsung Gear S2, which had an error rate of 5.1 percent.   But for calculating energy expenditure - or calories burned - all of the devices had error rates above 25 percent. The Fitbit Surge had the lowest average error rate for calories burned at about 27 percent. The PulseOn had the highest at about 93 percent, according to a report in the Journal of Personalized Medicine.   Overall, the Apple Watch had the lowest error rates while the Samsung Gear S2 had the highest.   The researchers were surprised at the unreliability of the calorie counts.   The devices “were literally all over the map with error rates,” Ashley said.   Data tended to be less accurate for men, people with higher body weights and darker skin tones, and while walking.   Ashley’s team hopes the devices’ calorie counting technology will improve. “I think we’re all hopeful that as we move forward they will get better,” he said.   In a statement to Reuters Health, Fitbit said its trackers show an estimated total number of calories. “Fitbit uses a scientifically validated estimate of (basal metabolic rate) based on height, weight, age, and gender information that users provide when setting up their Fitbit account,” said the statement, which added that the measure also takes into account people’s heart rates.   “While the Mio ALPHA 2 was designed for the individuals focused on heart rate zone training, and not for all-day activity tracking, we agree that more accurate calorie estimation is important for the industry as a whole, since most individuals are monitoring calorie deficits for weight loss,” said Mark Gorelick, chief science officer at Mio Global, in a statement.   Markku Lankinen, who is head of operations for PulseOn Oy, said in an email that the researchers may not have adjusted the device specifically for each participant. “With PulseOn device, you would need to apply these user parameters in the application before exercising, and this seems not to have been done,” said Lankinen. “This causes the (energy expenditure) estimates to be badly off.”   Apple, Microsoft and Samsung did not provide comments for publication. All Basis Peak watches were recalled in 2016 due to overheating, according to its website.   Ashley’s team is currently conducting a study to test the accuracy of devices in the real world.  "
2pXErCo,2017-05-26,Walking linked to improved brain function," A moderate-intensity walking regimen may reduce symptoms of mild cognitive impairment that are linked to poor blood vessel health in the brain, a small study suggests.                     People walk past a shoe store in Buenos Aires, Argentina, May 19, 2017. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci - RTX36NMZ      Participants with vascular cognitive impairment, sometimes called vascular dementia, who walked three hours per week for six months had improved reaction times and other signs of improved brain function, the Canadian team reports in British Journal of Sports Medicine.   Vascular cognitive impairment, or VCI, refers to mildly impaired thinking or more advanced dementia that’s due to the same kinds of blood vessel damage seen with heart disease elsewhere in the body. It is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease.    “It is well established that regular aerobic exercise improves cardiovascular health and cerebrovascular health,” the study’s senior author Teresa Liu-Ambrose told Reuters Health in an email.   “More specifically, it reduces one’s risk of developing chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes (type II), and high cholesterol. These chronic conditions have a negative impact on the brain - likely through compromised blood flow to the brain,” said Liu-Ambrose, a researcher with the Aging, Mobility, and Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.    The brain is a highly metabolic organ and to keep it healthy, it requires good blood flow to deliver the necessary nutrients and oxygen to its tissues, she added.   “It is worth noting that in our study, reduced blood pressure (secondary to exercise) was associated with improved cognitive function,” Liu-Ambrose said.   Aerobic exercise may also benefit the brain by increasing growth factors, which are substances made by the body that promote cell growth, differentiation and survival, she said.    Liu-Ambrose and colleagues randomly assigned 38 older adults with mild VCI to one of two groups. One group followed an aerobic training program consisting of three one-hour walking classes each week for six months, while the other group continued with their usual care. In addition, both groups were given information about vascular cognitive impairment and tips for eating a healthier diet.    Before the exercise program began and at the end of six months, all the participants also had functional MRI brain scans and other tests that measured neural activity and cognitive ability.   People in the aerobic training group had significant improvements in their reaction times on the cognitive tests, and showed changes in their brain activity that made them resemble healthy brains more. The comparison group showed no changes.    Overall, exercise appears to be a promising strategy for promoting cognitive health in older adults, Liu-Ambrose said.   “While more research is needed to better understand how it brings about its benefits and what factors may impact the degree of benefit observed, there is minimal negative consequence of exercising,” she said.   Liu-Ambrose said she doesn’t know if exercise can actually prevent VCI because there have been no studies to determine that. “However, population based studies do suggest that physical activity does reduce the risk of developing VCI. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, aerobic exercise is very effective in reducing vascular risk factors associated with VCI, such as high blood pressure.”   The study was small, and because participants had to be able to walk for up to an hour, it’s possible they were physically healthier than average, the authors note. The socializing involved in the walking classes might have also had some effect, they add.   “Given the small sample size, one needs to be cautious about interpreting the results of this pilot study. However, it is encouraging to see that the six-month aerobic exercise program improved certain aspects of cognition and showed changes on functional brain imaging,” said Dr. Joe Verghese, director of the Montefiore Einstein Center for the Aging Brain at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.    “The effect of exercise in this, and other studies seems to be on improving executive functions, which are required for planning, thinking and judgment,” Verghese, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   “The findings, if confirmed in larger studies, may have implications in advising exercise in older patients with vascular risk factors for brain protection,” Verghese said.

2qgYlIs,2017-05-25,Adolescent ADHD linked to teen parenthood,"  (Corrects age range to 30-34 in para 7, 12-16 and 17-19 in para 8, based on notice from study author that erroneous numbers appearing in the journal will be corrected)   By Carolyn Crist   (Reuters Health) - Adolescents who have attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder are much more likely than peers without the condition to become teenaged parents, according to a large Danish study.   In the 12-15 age group in particular, girls with ADHD were three and a half times more likely and boys were almost two and a half times more likely to become parents in their teen years.   “We were expecting to find an increased risk, but not of this magnitude,” said lead study author Dr. Soren Dinesen Ostergaard, of Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark.    ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about 5 percent of children and adolescents, according to the American Psychiatric Association. Recent studies have linked the inattentive and impulsive symptoms of the disorder with risky sexual behavior, but it was unclear if that also translates into higher rates of teen pregnancies and parenthood.   Past research has associated teenage parenthood with poor outcomes for both parents and children, including poverty, unemployment, increased health risks and behavioral problems, Ostergaard’s team writes in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.   “Our findings indicate that increasing the level of sexual education in children and adolescents with ADHD could be beneficial,” Ostergaard told Reuters Health by email. “That should be tested in future studies.”   The researchers looked at data for 2,698,052 people born between 1960 and 2001 in Denmark, including 27,479 with a diagnosis of ADHD. They analyzed the likelihood of becoming a parent during the age intervals 12-16, 17-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39 and over 40.    Overall, teens with ADHD are at least twice as likely as counterparts without the condition to become parents at ages 12-16 and 17-19, and they are likely to have a larger total number of children by age 25, the researchers found .    “It is well established that becoming a teenage parent, irrespective of your mental health status, is burdensome for both parents and children,” Ostergaard said. “It is also well known that parenting is often difficult for individuals with ADHD.”   He and his coauthors suggest creating new sexual education and contraceptive counseling programs tailored for adolescents with ADHD.    Before then, researchers should understand the reasons why ADHD is associated with teenage pregnancy, noted Andrea Chronis-Tuscano of the University of Maryland at College Park who wasn’t involved in the study.    Her own research centers on factors that influence risk for undesirable outcomes among children and young people with ADHD, such as risky sexual behavior among college students.   These factors can provide clues about how to intervene, she told Reuters Health. “In this case, maybe we could work on enhancing relationships with parents to prevent negative outcomes, rather than just teaching a safe sex program, which doesn’t address the impulsive nature of ADHD.”   Other factors to consider in future studies include individual beliefs and attitudes, as well as family factors such as education level and romantic relationships, said Dustin Sarver of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, who wasn’t involved in the new study.   The Danish study establishes that the association between ADHD and teenage parenthood exists, and now researchers must understand the “why” and “how,” Sarver said.   “The big step right now is awareness. Teenagers aren’t going to shy away from sex, and impulsivity only magnifies the potential problem,” he told Reuters Health. “I’ve found that parents are surprised to learn their children, especially girls, are at a higher risk, but they’re glad to have the issue raised so they can think ahead about how to address it.”  "
2rAPZz6,2017-05-24,Foot mat may help predict who will get a common diabetes complication," An experimental foot-temperature monitoring system might one day be able to detect when diabetic patients are developing foot ulcers, a common complication that can lead to infections and amputations, a small study suggests.    Diabetic foot ulcers typically develop on the bottom of the big toe or the ball of the foot, often when people wear ill-fitting shoes. Patients with diabetes frequently have nerve damage that limits their ability to feel pain, and as a result they don’t notice developing ulcers.    For the study, researchers tested a so-called smart mat designed to use variations in temperature at different points on the foot as a predictor of recurring foot ulcers in 129 patients who had this problem before. Skin temperature typically increases as ulcers develop.   When the study team tested for variations of 2.22 degrees Celsius (about 4 degrees Fahrenheit), they found the smart mat correctly identified 97 percent of foot ulcers observed by clinicians. But it also had a “false positive” rate of 57 percent, meaning clinicians didn’t find ulcers identified by the mat.    With a larger temperature variation of 3.20 degrees Celsius (about 5.75 degrees Fahrenheit), the false positive rate dropped to 32 percent, but the proportion of correctly identified foot ulcers also declined to 70 percent, researchers report in Diabetes Care.    “If we look at this technology as a risk stratification tool with high feasibility to be used at home on daily basis, it could be hugely beneficial to target those who are truly at risk,” said senior study author Dr. Bijan Najafi, a researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.    “I don’t think the point is having a system with no false-alarm,” Najafi said by email.    The device in the study was developed by Podimetrics Inc. in Somerville, Massachusetts, and it’s approved for sale in the U.S. for the periodic evaluation of temperature variations in the soles of the feet for signs of inflammation. Podimetrics sponsored the study of the mat for predicting diabetic foot ulcers.      In the current experiment, patients used the mat in much the same way they might use a common bathroom scale. Every day, they stepped on it and waited 20 seconds while it measured temperatures at different points on the soles of the feet, then the device wirelessly transmitted the temperature data to servers managed by Podimetrics. The data were saved and analyzed for variations in foot temperature that might signal developing ulcers.    In total, the trial ran 34 weeks, and 37 participants developed 53 foot ulcers during the study period.   For both of the temperature variation settings tested in the study, the mat correctly identified developing ulcers an average of 37 days before they were detected by a doctor.   That lead time might help patients schedule clinic visits and get treatment for ulcers sooner, when they’re easier to treat and less likely to lead to serious complications, Najafi said.    The study wasn’t designed to determine whether the mat actually reduced the development of ulcers or curbed costs to treat these ulcers, the authors note. Researchers only followed patients for 60 days, and it’s possible the rate of false positives or accurately identified ulcers might look different over a longer period of time.    In addition, the study only included patients with a history of diabetic foot ulcers, and the results might be different for people with diabetes who have never had this problem before, the authors point out.    While the high rate of false positives in the study suggests that the device still needs more testing and refinement, the technology holds a lot of potential to aid patients who currently have a high risk of infection and amputation because their developing ulcers go undetected, said Dr. David Armstrong, director of the Southern Arizona Limb Salvage Alliance at the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson.    “What’s really attractive about this technology is that it is probably going to get smarter,” Armstrong, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “This technology is probably going to personalize a heat signature for every patient and identify a hot spot for each patient.”  "
2pTqedr,2017-05-23,Abused infants may slip through the cracks in hospital systems," Infants who are victims of physical abuse take longer to get to a hospital and are less likely to receive emergency trauma care compared to children who sustain an accidental injury, researchers in the UK say.   “Victims of severe physical abuse are mostly under one year old . . . and arrive ‘by stealth’ to hospitals, often hours after injury,” lead author Dr. Ffion Davies of University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust told Reuters Health by email.   “This is the same the world over,” she said. “They are much less likely to arrive by ambulance, which is the mechanism by which trauma care systems in the U.S., Canada, Australia, UK and many European countries are ‘activated.’”   This means that from the start, these abused infants are unlikely to get the attention they need. “(They) arrive to non-designated trauma hospitals, have a delay in diagnosis, delay in key urgent treatments, and fare less well than those accidentally injured,” Davies said.    The study team analyzed data from the pediatric database of the UK’s national trauma registry from April 2012, when the UK created designated trauma centers, to June 2015.    Among 7,825 children, 94 percent were classified as having an accidental injury and 6 percent as cases of suspected child abuse.   On average, the children suspected of having been abused were much younger, with half under the age of 4 months, whereas half of those with accidental injuries were at least 7 years old. The abused children also tended to have more severe injuries and had nearly three times higher rates of death, at 5.7 percent versus 2.2 percent among the accidentally injured, according to the results in the Emergency Medicine Journal.   Fewer children with suspected abuse injuries arrived at the hospital via emergency services: 25.6 percent versus 44 percent by ambulance; and 0.6 percent versus 7.6 percent by helicopter.   Children with suspected abuse injuries also took longer to reach a hospital from the time of injury, with half arriving in under eight hours, compared to less than 1.5 hours for those with accidental injuries.   Similar delays in transfer to a major trauma unit were incurred. However, the combined parental and hospital delays meant that only half of children with suspected abuse injuries reached a trauma center within 21.6 hours post-injury compared with 13.8 hours for accidental injuries.   “The key recommendations are for all hospitals - not just trauma departments - to have an awareness that these victims of severe physical abuse are infants, and need to be detected as severe injury cases by frontline staff (ER doctors and nurses),” Davies said.   As soon as an abuse case is detected, she emphasized, “the trauma care system needs to be rapidly activated in order to give these children the best chance of survival.”   “The U.S. has the same issue,” noted Dr. Hnin Khine, associate director of the Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine of Children’s Hospital at Montefiore in New York.    “We see the same pattern of presentation, in how (parents) avoid contact with pre-hospital care and the same differences between accidental and non-accidental injury,” she told Reuters Health.   “I used to work in a trauma center,” Khine said. “The trauma system is set up for networking - like admission at the pre-hospital level - and it’s amazing when you have that. The problem is, it’s directed more at older children and adults who have accidental injury.”   Khine’s facility is not a trauma center, but she does see younger patients with severe injuries, mostly due to head injuries, she said.    “They’re not usually brought in by ambulance. Parents bring them in and say the child is vomiting and doesn’t want to eat. But often at least a day has passed and they’re very vague about how it happened,” Khine said.   “The infant doesn’t get intubated right away because parents try to elude the system and misdirect us,” she said.   While the study did a good job in presenting the problem, Khine said, “they really don’t have an answer for it. We just have to take a very detailed history and have a high suspicion when the history doesn’t match what we see. I don’t know of any system that is set up to pick up these suspected child abuse cases.”  "
2rJLiQW,2017-05-22,"Under Obamacare, insurance companies provide more breast pumps"," The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) may have helped more women in the United States breastfeed as a result of its coverage of breast pumps, suggests a new study.   Among women in Maine with private insurance, the number of claims for breast pumps rose 11-fold after the law’s breastfeeding provisions took effect.   “Something that is a pretty small provision has really made a big impact,” said lead author Summer Hawkins, of the Boston College School of Social Work.   The ACA - better known as Obamacare - contains two breastfeeding provisions, Hawkins and colleagues write in the American Journal of Public Health. It requires employers to provide women with breastfeeding time and a space to pump, and it requires private insurance companies to completely cover the cost of lactation support counseling and equipment rental.   Breastfeeding coverage began to take effect as early as 2012 for some plans,  they add.   “I was really intrigued that in early 2013 that there were these blog posts coming out about these national shortages of breast pumps due to the Affordable Care Act,” Hawkins told Reuters Health.   Pediatricians recommend that mothers exclusively breastfeed infants until at least 6 months of age because it is tied to reduced risk for babies of ear and respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, allergies, childhood obesity and diabetes.    Mothers may benefit too, with longer periods of breastfeeding linked to lower risks of depression, bone deterioration and certain cancers.   To see if there was a link between implementation of the ACA breastfeeding provisions and an increase in breastfeeding services, Hawkins’ team examined insurance claims data from Maine from 2012 through 2014.   Over the entire study period, the researchers found only 11 claims for breast pumps among women on Medicaid, the state and federal health insurance program for the poor. Medicaid does not cover the pumps.   Meanwhile, they found 70 claims for breast pumps among women with private insurance in the third quarter of 2012. That number rose to 629 a year later and to 803 in the third quarter of 2014.   “The next quarter this was offered, you saw an uptick,” said Hawkins of the claims for pumps. “Then the next quarter, you saw even more.”   There was no increase in claims for lactation services. Hawkins said that part of the regulations may not have been as clear for insurance companies.   The results are not surprising, said Diane Spatz, director of the Lactation Program and Mothers’ Milk Bank at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.   “We certainly know that access to breast pumps improved for some people in some populations with the Affordable Care Act, but it’s not universal,” said Spatz, who is also affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing in Philadelphia.   Spatz, who wasn’t involved with the new study, pointed out that claims did not increase among women on Medicaid, who are already less likely to start breastfeeding.   Spatz told Reuters Health that the legislation doesn’t specify what type of pump must be covered by insurance. But Hawkins noted that the vast majority of claims have been for electric or hospital-grade devices, which are generally preferable to manual pumps.   The data from Maine don’t necessarily reflect what is happening in other states, Hawkins said. And her team can’t say whether more women were actually breastfeeding once they got their pumps.   If efforts to repeal the ACA are successful and breastfeeding coverage is lost, the claim rates won’t continue to increase, Hawkins predicts.   “I think it would sort of roll back to what it was,” she said.  "
2qzRHzC,2017-05-19,Drugs approved with limited data aren’t always well-tested later," (Reuters Health) - New medicines that win U.S. marketing approval without conclusive evidence of their effectiveness aren’t always proven to work after they go on sale, a recent research review suggests.    Researchers focused on medicines approved for sale based on single pivotal trials or based on what’s known as “surrogate markers,” such as lab tests and signs of risk for disease such as cholesterol levels instead of true clinical outcomes like heart attacks or deaths. Many times no follow-up studies were published after these medicines went on sale, and when studies were published they often continued to rely on surrogate markers to suggest potential effectiveness.    “Everyone wants new drugs to be approved for use as quickly as possible - patients want access to innovative therapies and physicians want alternatives for their patients, particularly if they work better or are safer,” said senior study author Dr. Joseph Ross of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.    “However, speeding up the approval process increases our collective uncertainty about drugs’ benefits and safety,” Ross said by email. “This exposes patients to risks - the risk that they are spending their resources on therapies that do not work as well as expected as well as the possibility that they are taking drugs that have underlying safety risks that have not yet been figured out.”   For the study, researchers examined published studies of 117 medicines approved for treating 123 medical conditions by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration between 2005 and 2012, based on either a single pivotal trial or on trials that relied on surrogate endpoints.   Overall, no follow-up studies were published for 43 of the 123 approved indications, or 35 percent, researchers report in the BMJ. They examined research published up to about five years after the drugs won FDA approval.    For half of the conditions, no more than one post-approval study was published, the researchers found.    For the medicines cleared for sale based on surrogate markers, 90 percent of the studies published after they went on sale also used surrogate markers of disease.     Only six of the 33 uses for the drugs that had been approved by the FDA based on a single pivotal trial had a study published after approval that was a random experiment and proved the medicine worked better for specific clinical outcomes than a placebo or an alternative therapy.   Just one of the 49 uses approved based only on studies of surrogate markers had a gold-standard randomized study of clinical outcomes published after it went on sale that proved it worked better than no treatment or alternatives.    And only two of the 41 uses approved with a single pivotal trial and surrogate markers had a randomized study proving superior clinical effectiveness published after it was cleared for sale.    It’s possible that studies published after the analysis was done might have proven some of the medicines worked better than alternatives for specific clinical outcomes, the authors note. The results might also look different for other medicines that were approved with multiple pivotal trials instead of with only one, they say.    Even so, The study should make patients cautious about whether they are benefiting from new medicines before the health effects of the drugs are fully understood, said Dr. Barbara Mintzes, a researcher at the University of Sydney who wasn’t involved in the study.    “This study raised a strong note of caution because the follow-up studies needed to show if these medicines are truly beneficial are either not being done or do not use the type of rigorous scientific methods needed to adequately test these medicines,” Mintzes said by email. “In many cases, when a new medicine is approved, there are already better tested treatments available.”  "
2qC0M9d,2017-05-19,"With mental health problems, fitness is tied to reduced risk of death"," For men experiencing emotional distress like depression, anxiety or thoughts of suicide, having high cardiorespiratory fitness may cut the risk of death in half compared to those in poor condition, researchers say.   “The prevalence of mental health issues is growing in the U.S. and globally,” said lead study author Mei Sui of the University of South Carolina in Columbia. “People are facing many stressors in their daily lives linked to depression, anxiety and other mental disorders.   “Medication to treat these mental problems is not only expensive but also comes with significant side effects such as weight gain,” she told Reuters Health. “Identifying modifiable factors that are beneficial to those with emotional distress has important clinical and public health applications.”   Mental health conditions cost the U.S. about $2.5 trillion in 2010 and are projected to cost the country $6 trillion by 2030, the authors write in Mayo Clinic Proceedings.    To see how cardiovascular fitness might affect healthcare costs and outcomes for people with mental health disorders, Sui and colleagues analyzed data from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas, which conducted preventive health exams on more than 43,000 men between 1987 and 2002.    The researchers focused on 5,240 participants who reported a history of emotional distress, including 2,229 who reported more than one emotional distress condition. To measure cardiorespiratory fitness, participants ran on a treadmill until they were exhausted.    Among men who experienced emotional distress, 46 percent reported depression, 58 percent had anxiety, 51 percent had a history of mental counseling, and 8 percent reported ever having thoughts of suicide.    By the end of the follow up period, there were 128 deaths from any cause.   The researchers found that men with the lowest cardiovascular fitness tended to have higher weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels and were more likely to smoke and to be sedentary.   In addition, men who reported more than one type of emotional distress were more common in the low-fitness group.    Compared to the lowest-fitness group, men with moderate cardiovascular fitness were 46 percent less likely to die of any cause during the study, and those in the high fitness group were 53 percent less likely to die.   “This significant strong inverse association between high levels of fitness and longevity in men with emotional distress is particularly interesting,” Sui said. “Clearly lifestyle behavior interventions to increase fitness levels could help those with emotional distress.”   Even moderate levels of fitness were associated with a 46 percent lower risk of dying, she noted. This moderate level of fitness means 30 minutes per day of activity such as swimming, jogging or biking, and is the current level recommended under American sports medicine guidelines.   The study mostly included non-Hispanic whites, and Sui would like to see more research about fitness in women and minority groups.   “This was the missing piece of the puzzle. We know now that assessing fitness and treating it should be at the center of mental health care,” said Davy Vancampfort of the University of Leuven Psychiatric Center in Belgium. He wasn’t involved in the current study but recently published an analysis that found people with severe mental illness are at heightened risk for heart disease    ( bit.ly/2qwMmsy ).   “This adds to our call to include assessment of physical activity and treatment to the standard mental health care package,” he told Reuters Health by email. “Mental health care settings and primary care settings should work closely together on this.”   Future research could also look at older populations, follow people for a longer period of time and account for medication such as psychotropic prescriptions in particular, said Brandon Stubbs of King’s College London in the UK.    “One in four of us will at some point experience a common mental illness in our lives,” Stubbs, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Reuters Health by email. “We can no longer view mental health and physical health separately given that they are so inextricably linked.”  "
2rkw6MJ,2017-05-19,Oil-based infertility test produces higher pregnancy rate than water-based test: study," (Reuters Health) - When it comes to using X-rays to check a woman’s reproductive system in search of  a cause for her infertility, oil turns out to be better than water.   A new study concludes that when doctors are debating whether to use a water-based or oil-based contrast fluid to inject into the egg-carrying tubes - part of a test known as hysterosalpingography - infertile women conceive more often with oil.   The pregnancy rate after six months was 40 percent when the oil-based fluid was used versus 29 percent with a water-based contrast media. The rates of live births were 39 percent and 28 percent respectively.   “If a woman has an indication to check her tubes with this test, then my advice would be to use the oil contrast,” chief author Dr. Kim Dreyer of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam told Reuters Health by phone.   The results were clear, but why oil would produce more pregnancies remains a mystery.   “We did not look at the mechanism,” she said. “Now we have to do further research to understand why.”   Nonetheless, the results, announced at the 13th World Congress on Endometriosis in Vancouver and published online by the New England Journal of Medicine, suggest an inexpensive step that can be used in some women before in vitro fertilization is attempted.   For years there was a suspicion among doctors that the diagnostic test and the oil contrast medium might enhance pregnancy rates. One review of previously published randomized controlled tests found a 3.6-fold increase in pregnancy. Yet there’s been no clear evidence that oil contrast is better than water.   “When I was doing this study, a lot of people said, ‘We know there’s no difference.’ But some said, ‘Why do the study because we know it works?’ That’s exactly why we had to do this study,” said Dreyer, a gynecology intern.   The results are based on 1,108 women treated in 27 hospitals in the Netherlands.   The volunteers, age 18 to 39, had been unable to conceive for at least a year and their Fallopian tubes were being evaluated as part of an attempt to discover why. All had spontaneous menstrual cycles. Oil and water contrast fluids were manufactured by France-based Guerbet. The trial was not blinded.   When the chance of the woman getting pregnant on her own over the next 12 months was estimated to be less than 30 percent, the woman was also offered intrauterine insemination. Insemination was also used when the man’s sperm count was mildly low or if at least two additional months since the test had passed without pregnancy.    A blockage of both Fallopian tubes, which carry the eggs for fertilization, was seen in just under 2 percent of the women in the oil group and just over 2 percent in the water group. More than 57 percent of the women in both groups were assigned to a wait-and-see approach, rather than insemination.   The average time to pregnancy was 2.7 months with oil and 3.1 months with water, a statistically significant difference.   In the oil group, 74 percent of the pregnancies were naturally conceived. The rate was 73 percent in the water group.   The two groups had comparable rates of adverse events.   Two women in each group developed an ectopic pregnancy.   The rate of congenital birth defects in offspring was 1.4 percent - reflecting 3 cases - in the 554-member oil group. There were no cases in the water group. Among the three children, one required surgery for esophageal atresia, one had developmental delay from chromosomal mosaicism and one died after receiving palliative care for severe bone and cartilage problems.   The higher rate of congenital problems “is probably due to chance,” Dreyer’s team wrote. “The frequency of congenital anomalies with oil contrast was not greater than rates reported in the general population.”   They said the pregnancy effect might be caused by oil being more effective at flushing debris and dislodging mucus plugs in the Fallopian tubes, but a direct endometrial effect seems unlikely because higher pregnancy rates were seen over multiple menstrual cycles.   The group has not completed a cost-effectiveness analysis but they calculated that only 10 women would need to be treated to produce an extra pregnancy.   “Tubal flushing with hysterosalpingography during a fertility workup is minimally invasive and inexpensive, as compared with IVF,” the researchers noted, and it hikes the odds of conception by 10 percentage points.   Dreyer cautioned women that “it won’t work for every woman who wants to get pregnant. There are a lot of other problems that hinder a pregnancy.”  "
2qRLWPa,2017-05-18,Low dairy consumption tied to risk of early menopause," Women in their early 40s with the highest intake of vitamin D and calcium from food sources may have a lower than average risk of starting menopause before age 45, a recent study suggests.   Taking vitamin D or calcium in supplement form had no benefit in the large study of U.S. nurses, the study team writes in American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, and there may be other substances in dairy foods that also contribute to their apparent protective effect.   “Early menopause can have substantial health impacts for women. It increases their risk of cardiovascular disease and early cognitive decline and osteoporosis,” lead author Alexandra Purdue-Smithe told Reuters Health.   In addition, as women are delaying having kids into their later reproductive years, having early menopause can have a substantial impact on their ability to conceive as they wish, which can have psychological and financial consequences, said Purdue-Smithe, an epidemiologist with the School of Public Health and Health Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.   “Given that (early menopause) affects roughly 10 percent of women in the U.S. and other Western populations, it felt like a worthwhile problem to start investigating and seeing if there are any potentially modifiable risk factors for it,” she said.   Menopause, when a woman stops menstruating and her levels of hormones like estrogen decline, typically happens between the ages of 45 and 55. Menopause before age 45 is considered “early.”   Vitamin D may be involved in some of the hormonal mechanisms of early menopause, but little is known about how dietary vitamin D and calcium affect the risk, Purdue-Smithe and her colleagues write.    They analyzed data from the Nurses’ Health Study II, a long-term study of more than 100,000 U.S. registered nurses who were 25 to 42 years old in 1989 when they began answering health questionnaires every two years.   The questionnaires were designed to assess the nurses’ lifestyles, behaviors and overall health. Questions about diet were asked five times over 20 years. Researchers followed the participants until 2011, by which time 2,041 women experienced early menopause.   “The women who consumed the most vitamin D from food sources had a 17 percent lower risk of having early menopause as compared to women who consumed the least,” Purdue-Smithe said. The researchers found this association only with dairy sources of vitamin D, like milk, not with non-dairy sources like oily fish.   Women who consumed the most calcium from food sources were also about 13 percent less likely to experience early menopause compared to women who consumed the least calcium, and once again, only dairy foods seemed to provide a benefit.    “Our next direction is to look at actual individual dairy foods and see if there’s something else going on with dairy itself,” Purdue-Smithe said.   The study team also found that taking high doses of calcium in supplement form was associated with a higher risk of early menopause. But the researchers speculate that these women might have been diagnosed with osteoporosis or other conditions that are also risk factors for early menopause.   “Most of what is known about the relationship between calcium and Vitamin D and women’s issues is related to bone health,” said Sandra Arevalo, a dietitian and director of the Nutrition Services and Community Outreach for Community Pediatrics at Montefiore Medical Center in New York.   Lack of Vitamin D and calcium in a woman’s diet, mainly as age progresses, increases her risk of low bone mineral density, osteoporosis and bone fractures, said Arevalo, who wasn’t involved in the study.   The top 10 food sources of calcium are low-fat yogurt, low-fat cheese, sardines, calcium-fortified soy milk, calcium-fortified orange juice, salmon, calcium fortified ready-to-eat cereal, turnips, kale and bok choi, she noted in an email.

2rwcSkh,2017-05-18,Surgeons on board with teaching public to stop bleeding in emergencies," (Reuters Health) - Just as many regular people have already learned CPR, members of the public can and should learn techniques to stop bleeding after mass-shooting events or everyday injuries, a survey of U.S. surgeons concludes.   “It’s a simple skill, which if you don’t have it, could lead to someone bleeding significantly and potentially dying,” said lead study author Lenworth Jacobs, director of the Hartford Hospital Trauma Institute in Connecticut.   “Our goal is to inform and empower the public because that first line of defense can really make a difference,” he told Reuters Health. “If someone drops in front of you, you want to feel like you can save a life.”   Jacobs and his colleagues tested their 15-minute bleeding control course, called B-Con, at a national meeting of surgeons in October 2016 by teaching 341 attendees techniques for stopping bleeding just as members of the public would be trained.    After the course, they surveyed the participating surgeons about whether they thought the training initiative was a good idea. Jacobs’ team found that 94 percent of the doctors agreed that teaching bleeding control should be a national priority. In addition, 93 percent said the course was at the right difficulty level to train citizens. About 82 percent said people would need a refresher course every two or three years to remember proper bleeding control techniques.    “In a previous survey across the country, we found that 90 percent of the public was interested in learning how to stop bleeding, which really surprised us,” Jacobs said. “What they don’t want is to feel frozen when something happens right in front of them.”   The training program, described on the BleedingControl.org website, teaches hemorrhage control skills, including direct pressure, wound packing and tourniquet application in extreme situations. The goal is to pair the course with CPR education to spread it nationwide.   After the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012, the American College of Surgeons created the Joint Committee to Create a National Policy to Enhance Survivability from Mass Casualty Shooting Events. Following the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, the committee expanded their focus to all mass casualty events, as well as everyday events that result in severe bleeding, such as car accidents or kitchen knife mishaps.    The committee started a national initiative called Bystanders: Our Nation’s Immediate Responders, and the White House began the Stop the Bleed campaign in 2015 to encourage the public to learn bleeding control techniques. The B-Con course is the latest step toward make bleeding control instruction a nationwide program, Jacobs’ team writes in the Journal of the American College of Surgeons.   The campaign includes promotional efforts, Jacobs noted. For example, Rob Lowe and Marcia Harden, stars of the popular CBS show “Code Black,” did a one-minute public service announcement at the end of an episode that was seen by 7 million viewers. The American College of Surgeons is also encouraging schools and workplaces to put bleeding control kits next to automatic defibrillators.   “The world has changed. If we want to talk about building a resilient country, this is one thing everyone can do to help increase personal preparedness,” said Alexander Eastman, director of the trauma center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.   Eastman, who wasn’t involved with the study, is part of a U.S. Department of Homeland Security team that has promoted the Stop the Bleed campaign.    “What surprises me is the willingness of Americans to help their fellow man or woman when they need it,” he told Reuters Health. “Previously, in shooter situations, we taught everyone to run and hide, and now people want to help, which hasn’t been documented before.”   A bleeding control program, however, must address concerns about seeing and touching blood, as well as getting an infection or causing additional harm to the injured person.   “Bleeding is not a reason for panic,” said George Velmahos, chief of trauma and critical care at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Valmahos, who wasn’t involved with the study, is part of a team that will be teaching the B-Con course in high schools around Boston.    “The next step is clearly evaluating the effectiveness of this course for the public,” he told Reuters Health by email. “Is this just a nice exercise, or is the average citizen really likely to save a life? This research will be hard to do, but it’s necessary to prove this major effort is worthwhile.”  "
2pZM7mA,2017-05-18,Birth weight may impact intelligence throughout life," Being born at below-normal weight is associated with a lower intelligence quotient (IQ) not only in childhood and young adulthood, but even at age 50, according to a new study from Denmark.     Researchers found IQ differences between underweight and normal-weight babies remained stable into midlife, and even within the normal birth weight range, higher weights equated with slightly higher IQ throughout life.   “We found that the association between birth weight and intelligence is stable from young adulthood into midlife,” said lead study author Trine Flensborg-Madsen of the University of Copenhagen.    “There are long-term cognitive consequences of birth weight that do not diminish,” Flensborg-Madsen said by email.    Birth weights of less than 2.5 kilograms (5 pounds, 8.2 ounces) have long been linked to a variety of health problems including the potential for a lower intelligence quotient (IQ) in youth. A normal birth weight ranges from 2.5 kg to 4 kg (8 pounds, 13.1 ounces) and the average weight of infants in the current study was 3.3 kg (7 pounds, 4.4 ounces).   Compared to babies born at 2.5 kg or less, infants with a birth weight of 3.5 to 4 kg scored more than five points higher on IQ tests at age 28 and again at age 50, the study found.    Worldwide, about 22 million babies, or 16 percent of infants, are born at a low birth weight each year, increasing their risk of death in the first months and years of life, according to UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund.    Babies are often underweight when they’re born premature or have restricted fetal growth. Both of these problems are more common in the developing world and typically occur because mothers have pregnancy complications tied to poverty or poor nutrition.   For the current study, researchers examined data on almost 4,700 babies born in Copenhagen from 1959 to 1961, including birth records and results from intelligence assessments done when participants were 19, 28 and 50 years old.    They sorted babies into five weight categories: underweight, meaning 2.5 kg or less; 2.5 kg to 3 kg; more than 3 kg up to 3.5 kg; more than 3.5 kg up to 4 kg; and overweight, or more than 4 kg.    Average-weight babies in the study fell in the middle category of more than 3 kg up to 3.5 kg.    Birth weight was significantly associated with intelligence at all three follow-up assessments, researchers report in Pediatrics.    This association remained even after researchers adjusted for other factors that can influence intelligence such as household socioeconomic status and babies’ gestational age. A low birth weight can’t explain all of this connection because the association also held up among babies born at a range of healthy weights, the authors also note.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that low birth weight directly causes lower IQ scores or that heavier babies are smarter.   Another limitation is the potential for many factors not explored in the study, such as home environment, maternal stress or parental intelligence, to influence babies’ future IQ scores, the authors point out.    Parents also shouldn’t be worried, because the absolute effect size is very small, said Dr. Susan Shenkin, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh who wasn’t involved in the study. Many decades ago, limited prenatal care might have also influenced how babies in the study developed in ways that would be different for infants born today, Skenkin said by email.    “The brain develops rapidly before birth, and therefore lower birth weight may reflect a poorer environment for brain growth,” Shenkin added. “We still can’t say whether low birth weight ‘causes’ lower cognitive ability test scores.”  "
2pPhvZM,2017-05-18,Morning daylight exposure tied to a good night’s sleep," Workers who are exposed to sunlight or bright indoor lights during the morning hours sleep better at night and tend to feel less depressed and stressed than those who don’t get much morning light, according to a recent study.                    Doves, silhouetted against the rising sun, fly over the Jordanian capital of Amman September 5, 2013. REUTERS/Muhammad Hamed       Exposure to more light during the day and less light at night is critical for healthy sleep patterns because it helps to calibrate the body’s internal “circadian” clock, the study team writes in the journal Sleep Health.    The results suggest that in office environments, being exposed either to daylight or electric lights that are rich in short wave “blue” light may be important for the health of workers, said lead author Mariana Figueiro.   Many office buildings may actually be moving in the direction of reducing light said Figueiro, program director at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. “Much has been done to reduce light levels to promote energy efficiency, which is important, but we may be going too far in this direction,” she told Reuters Health by email.    “We need to start thinking about how we light our daytime environments,” Figueiro added.   To see whether typical office workers get enough light to regulate their sleep-wake cycle, the study team recruited participants in five government office buildings across the United States.   A total of 109 employees working at the offices wore light-measuring devices for one week in summertime to gauge their exposure to different types of light throughout the day, and 81 of these participants repeated the experiment in winter as well.   The office workers logged their sleep and wake times and completed questionnaires about their mood and sleep quality at the end of each study period.   Researchers found that people who were exposed to greater amounts of light during the morning hours, between 8 a.m. and Noon, fell asleep more quickly at night and had fewer sleep disturbances during the night compared to those exposed to low light in the morning.   People getting more morning light were also less likely to report feelings of depression and stress.   Office workers who were exposed to high levels of light all day, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., also reported lower levels of sleep disturbance and depression.   “Individuals should think about their lighting environment at work, and also some of their habits during the day (and before bed),” Ilia Karatsoreos, an associate professor of integrative physiology and neuroscience at Washington State University in Pullman, told Reuters Health by email.   A lack of good quality sleep has been linked to mental and physical health problems, including issues with mood, thinking, metabolism and the immune system, said Karatsoreos, who was not involved in the study.    “There are many easy things we can do during the day to increase our exposure to sunlight that could have beneficial effects on mood and sleep for many people,” Karatsoreos noted. “Perhaps leaving your desk and getting out in the bright sun for lunch could help.”   “A robust light and dark pattern (high circadian effective light during the day and low in the evening) is important for our health and wellbeing,” Figueiro said.   “Look out a window, seek light during the day, especially during the morning, go out during lunch time,” Figueiro advised.  "
2qepy1a,2017-05-17,"Combination of strength, aerobic training found best for obese elderly"," (Reuters Health) - For obese people over age 64, the combination of aerobic exercise and weight training is better for improving physical functioning than either form of exercise alone, a new study concludes.   Each type of exercise and a combination of the two produced 9 percent reductions in body weight over six months. But the combination provided the best mix of protection against muscle and bone loss with improved aerobic capacity.   Aerobic exercise and weight training, also known as resistance training, “have additive effects in improving your physical function,” chief author Dr. Dennis Villareal of the Baylor College of Medicine and the DeBakey VA Medical Center in Houston told Reuters Health by phone. “Overall the patient feels it, and we were able to document that objectively.”   The findings in the New England Journal of Medicine have broad significance because one third of older adults in the United States are obese, with all the health risks that come with being very overweight. Yet there is concern that weight loss might make them even more frail because bone and muscle might be lost as well.   The results suggest that fear is unfounded.   One hundred sixty volunteers from New Mexico with a body-mass index of 30 or higher, putting them in the obese category, and no history of regular exercise were enrolled in the study. Of this group, 141 participants, mostly white well-educated women, completed it. To assess physical performance, the Villareal team used a 37-point scale, where higher numbers indicated better physical performance.   The volunteers who participated in 60-minute aerobic or weight training sessions three times a week for six months showed increases in performance of 14 percent, improving by 3.9 points on that 37-point scale.   The volunteers who got both aerobic and strength training in longer sessions that lasted 75 to 90 minutes showed an improvement of 5.5 points, or 21 percent.   “In essence, the combined group exercised more than the aerobic group alone and the resistance group alone,” said Dr. Felipe Lobelo of the Emory University - Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta, who was not involved in the study. “So in terms of the volume of energy expenditure, that group did more. So to me it’s not surprising to me that they got more benefits.”   But Villareal said there was concern that the two types of exercise, if combined in a single session, might interfere with each other so the exercise time in the combined group was longer.   “Otherwise they will be doing less resistance and less aerobic as compared to the resistance group and the aerobic group,” he said. “That’s not a fair comparison.”    “I think the ‘interference’ between endurance training and strength training found in some laboratory-based training studies has been overblown,” said Dr. Benjamin Levine, director of the Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine in Dallas, which is partly run by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.   “Virtually every competitive athlete knows that the best outcome comes from a combination of strength, endurance and technical training,” Levine, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email. “I am not sure why the investigators tried to combine them on the same day, but this study shows that - depending on patient preference and logistics - combining them is not detrimental.”   Not surprisingly, some of the exercisers had some adverse events such as shoulder, knee, hip or back pain. One person in the aerobic group fell, receiving hand and forehead scrapes.   Levine said the study, known as LITOE, “highlights a common misperception about obese individuals - although these patients were considered ‘frail,’ their overall cardiorespiratory capacity was actually remarkably normal, which is common in obese individuals who have to carry around a lot of weight in their daily lives.”   He added, “I look forward to seeing the follow up on these patients to learn how they do over the long term, since six months is a short time and fitness/strength/vitality is a lifelong process.”   “How easy it is going to be to replicate this in real life is still unknown,” Lobelo said. “The next studies will have to tease out whether you can get people to do this in a real-life scenario.”  "
2pH28Bb,2017-05-17,Weight loss tied to lower risk of knee joint degeneration," Overweight and obese people who shed a lot of excess pounds may have less damage in their knee joints than their counterparts who don’t lose weight, a recent study suggests.    While previous research has linked obesity to an increased risk of joint disease and cartilage damage in the knees, the current study underscores how weight loss may help minimize this risk.    Researchers followed 640 obese and overweight patients for four years. By the end of the study, participants who lost more than 10 percent of their weight were 66 percent less likely than people who didn’t lose any weight to show progression in the deterioration of their knee joint cartilage.    People who shed 5 percent to 10 percent of their weight were also less likely to have progression in knee joint damage, but the difference wasn’t big enough to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    “Our study shows that a lifestyle intervention such as weight loss can slow the process of knee joint degeneration in patients at risk for and with osteoarthritis and therefore may slow the worsening of symptoms such as pain and disability, said lead study author Dr. Alexandra Gersing of the University of California, San Francisco.   “The more weight loss the patients achieved, the greater the benefits were, even if they remained obese after losing weight,” Gersing said by email.    Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease in the United States, affecting more than half of people 75 and older, researchers note in the journal Radiology. Compared with people at normal weight, obese women are nearly four times more likely to develop knee osteoarthritis, while obese men have five times the risk.     At the start of the study, participants were 63 years old, on average, and typically very overweight or obese. Most of them had either minimal or moderate damage to the knee joint, based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams.    Four years later, roughly half of the participants were at about the same weight as when they started. Another 238 people lost between 5 percent and 10 percent of their weight and 82 participants lost more than 10 percent of their weight.    Not only did the researchers find that weight loss slowed cartilage degeneration, they also saw changes in the menisci, crescent-shaped pads that protect and cushion the joint.   The study wasn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that weight loss prevents knee joint damage or osteoarthritis.    Limitations of the study include the lack of data on weight-loss methods participants used, which may have influenced what happened with their knee joints, the authors note.    Even so, the study offers fresh evidence of how weight loss may benefit the knee joints, said Dr. Leena Sharma, director of the Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center in Rheumatology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.   “This study uniquely gets at the benefits of weight loss on specific tissue abnormalities in knee osteoarthritis and convincingly demonstrates the benefit of weight loss on the course of this common condition,” Sharma, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.   It should also encourage patients to consider the benefits of even a little bit of weight loss,” said Dr. Kent Kwoh, director of the University of Arizona Arthritis Center in Tucson.   “Losing weight can help overweight and obese patients protect their knees and keep their arthritis from getting worse,” Kwoh, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “At this point in time, joint damage cannot be reversed; we can only keep it from getting worse.”  "
2rcVbcq,2017-05-16,"Even with free sunscreen, most people don&#039;t use enough"," Offering free sunscreen to people at public events might not be enough to motivate them to properly protect themselves from harmful rays, a recent experiment suggests.   Researchers set up complimentary sunscreen dispensers at 10 information booths at the Minnesota State Fair, which typically draws more than 1.7 million attendees each August.     About 17,000 people used the free sunscreen. The researchers observed 2,187 sunscreen users and found just 33 percent of them applied it to all sun-exposed areas of their skin.   “Unfortunately, for many people, sun protection is not a priority,” said senior study author Dr. Ingrid Polcari of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.    “All exposed skin should be protected from the sun, either with clothes or with sunscreen,” Polcari said by email.    When people at the fair didn’t use enough sunscreen, about half of them covered their upper arms and roughly 42 percent applied it to their face, researchers report in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. Very few of them applied sunscreen on their chest or legs.   Among people observed using at least some sunscreen, 38 percent didn’t have any additional protection like a hat, sunglasses or long-sleeved clothing, the study also found.    Women did better than men: they made up 51 percent of people at the fair but accounted for 57 percent of sunscreen users at the free sunscreen stations.   Fairgoers were more likely to use sunscreen when it was sunnier outside than when it was cloudy, and sunscreen use declined dramatically on completely overcast days.    “Many people believe that sunscreen is only for when you are at the beach and that it’s not needed as part of their everyday lives,” said Dr. Elizabeth Martin, president of Pure Dermatology and Aesthetics in Hoover, Alabama.   “Many people also mistakenly believe that they do not need sunscreen on cloudy days, but even then, up to about 80 percent of the sun’s harmful UV rays can reach the skin,” Martin, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    One limitation of the study is that sunscreen habits in Minnesota might not necessarily reflect what people would do in places where the weather is generally warmer and sunnier. It also didn’t look at individual characteristics that might influence whether people used sunscreen or how much they applied.    Most people need at least an ounce of sunscreen, or enough to fill a shot glass, to cover all the exposed parts of their body, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.   It should offer broad spectrum (UVA and UVB) protection and have a Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 30 or higher, the AAD recommends. Sunscreen should be applied at least 15 minutes before going outdoors, and reapplied every two hours or after swimming or sweating even if it’s labeled as water resistant.   Even when people get it for free, they still may not use sunscreen correctly because it requires more effort than other types of giveaways, said Dr. David Leffell, chief of dermatological surgery and cutaneous oncology at Yale School of Medicine.    “If they were giving out free candy bars, makeup or pool noodles, I am sure everyone would take advantage,” Leffell, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “The problem with free sunscreen is that it is one of those gifts that requires you to do something, like giving someone a pet as a birthday present.”  "
2pPGTJS,2017-05-15,Does the weather influence women&#039;s risk for pregnancy diabetes?," (Reuters Health) - Yet another reason to worry about global warming may be an increase in the number of women who develop diabetes during pregnancy, suggests a new study that found seasonal higher temperatures are tied to an increased risk for what’s known as gestational diabetes.   Researchers found Canadian women were more likely to be diagnosed with gestational diabetes if they were exposed to higher average outdoor temperatures during pregnancy, compared to women who were pregnant in cooler periods.   “It’s compelling evidence that air temperature is tied with increasing gestational risk,” said lead author Dr. Gillian Booth, of St. Michael’s Hospital and the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences in Toronto.   Booth and colleagues write in the Canadian Medical Association Journal that research suggests exposure to the cold increases people’s sensitivity to the hormone insulin.   People with type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes don’t respond to or don’t produce enough of the hormone, which helps the body convert sugar into energy.   Nearly one in 10 mothers-to-be may develop gestational diabetes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   The condition increases the risk of women having gestational and type II diabetes in the future. Also, it increases the risk of women having larger-than-normal babies that may result in delivery complications or C-sections.   For the new study, the researchers analyzed data from 396,828 women and their 555,911 deliveries in the Greater Toronto Area from 2002 to 2014.   The researchers compared the risk of developing diabetes during pregnancy among women exposed to an average outdoor temperature of at most -10 degrees Celsius (C), or 14 degrees Fahrenheit (F), during the 30 days before their gestational diabetes test to women exposed to at least 24 degrees C, about 75 degrees F, before their tests.   The prevalence of gestational diabetes among women exposed to colder outdoor temperatures was 4.6 percent, compared to 7.7 percent among women exposed to warmer temperatures.   Every 10 degree C increase in average outdoor temperature was tied to a 6 percent increase in the risk of women developing gestational diabetes, the researchers found.   When they restricted the analyses to women who had more than one birth during the study period, the results were similar.   The increased risk may be important as global temperatures are expected to rise 1 to 2 degrees C by 2050, Booth told Reuters Health.   “That may seem like a small number, but 10 to 15 million women around the world have gestational diabetes annually and that may potentially have a big impact,” she said.   The new study can’t prove that warmer temperatures cause women to have gestational diabetes, said Dr. Kathryn Drennan, a maternal fetal medicine physician at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.   For example, there may be other seasonal factors influencing the risk of gestational diabetes like fluctuating vitamin D levels, said Drennan, who wasn’t involved with the new study.   “I think for the average pregnant women, they shouldn’t be concerned about this,” she told Reuters Health. “I think from a systems-wide level, it’s a bigger concern especially with the warming climate.”   The study gives researchers a reason to investigate the relationship between temperature and gestational diabetes, said Drennan.   “This is the first study I’ve seen looking at this particular aspect of gestational diabetes,” she said. “It’s a nice way to start looking at this relationship.”  "
2pGtIQf,2017-05-16,Do kids need ear tubes for infections and fluid buildup?," It’s hard to say for sure which kids will benefit most from a common childhood surgery for infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear, a research review suggests.    The reviewers focused on a procedure known as tympanostomy, surgery to place tiny tubes in the eardrum that help improve air flow and prevent fluid accumulation in the middle ear. They looked at both what’s known as otitis media with effusion, or chronic accumulation of fluid that’s not infected, as well as recurrent acute otitis media, or a buildup of infected pus that can be painful and put pressure on the ear drum.    The study team analyzed data combined from 147 previously published articles on the surgery and found it associated with less short-term hearing loss in kids with a chronic buildup of uninfected fluid but no evidence of benefit by 12 to 24 months compared to children who didn’t get the treatment.    Kids with acute infections may have fewer episodes after surgery, but evidence is limited, the review also found. The limited data makes it hard to draw conclusions about which kids may benefit most from ear tubes, said lead author Dr. Dale Steele of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.    “Tubes might be most effective in young children less than three years of age who are in daycare, and in older children with persisting hearing impairments for at least 12 weeks,” Steele said by email.    Fluid in the ear can sometimes be accompanied by temporary hearing problems, and when it’s infected it can be quite painful. The fluid may go away without treatment within a few weeks or months, but when fluid remains in the ear for more than three months it can exacerbate other problems with speech, language and learning.    Ear tube surgery is very common in the U.S., with an estimated 667,000 kids under 15 years of age getting the procedure each year, the authors note in Pediatrics.    For otherwise healthy children, doctors often advise parents not to consider ear tubes until after they’ve waited at least a few months to see if problems resolve without surgery. The study findings suggest that this cautious approach is warranted, Steele said.    When kids have uninfected fluid, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery recommends surgery only after at least three months of fluid buildup when kids have documented hearing problems or when children have issues with things like balance, behavior or school performance that might be tied to their ear issues.    When that ear fluid is infected, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends surgery only for multiple infections: three episodes in six months or four episodes in a year with the last one occurring within the previous six months.    One limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t have enough data to assess which kids would benefit most from surgery, the authors note.    “What is interesting and revealing from this review is that, for a very common childhood disease such as ear disease, there are still many unanswered questions,” said Dr. Kenneth Whittemore, Jr. of the Department of Otolaryngology and Communication Enhancement at Boston Children’s Hospital.    “It is clear that more studies are needed to determine which children are good candidates for the placement of tympanostomy tubes for middle ear disease,” Whittemore, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Watchful waiting is almost always an option to be offered unless there is a medical urgency requiring the immediate drainage of fluid.”   Because this surgery is generally elective, parents should be sure to question doctors about the necessity before consenting to the procedure, said Dr. Richard Rosenfeld, chairman of Otolaryngology at State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in New York City.    “Parents should never do it if they have doubts or concerns,” Rosenfeld, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “In that case, they should follow up with their doctor every six months to monitor the fluid, hearing and eardrums to see if anything changes that would argue for, or against, tube insertion.”  "
2qJGIVj,2017-05-15,Many U.S. daycare centers may lack plans for pandemic flu," Fewer than one in 10 U.S. daycare center directors have taken concrete steps to prepare for a pandemic flu outbreak, a recent study suggests.    Researchers surveyed directors of licensed childcare centers in 2008 and again in 2016, to assess flu prevention measures before and after the 2009 pandemic outbreak of a new strain of H1N1 influenza. Among other things, they looked at flu prevention activities like daily health checks for kids, infection control training for staff, communicating with parents about illness and immunization requirements for children and staff.   Both before and after the 2009 global outbreak, only about 7 percent of directors surveyed said they did any of these flu prevention activities, the study found.    “Pandemic influenza is different than seasonal influenza,” said lead study author Dr. Timothy Shope of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. “It is a novel virus that can be transmitted from person to person and to which most of the world’s population has no immunity.”   For seasonal flu, immunizations are the most effective tool for prevention, Shope said by email. But there’s no vaccine for pandemic influenza, and it takes months once a new virus is discovered to develop a new vaccine for it, he added.    During a pandemic with high rates of disease and death, public health officials may need to close daycare centers and schools to help prevent the spread of the virus.    “So pandemic influenza preparedness involves everything we normally do for seasonal influenza except immunization, but also relies on child care centers creating plans to identify who would be responsible for notifying them of closure, how to communicate with parents in the event of a closure, and encouraging parents to have alternative care plans,” Shope added.    Without vaccines, efforts to prevent the spread of pandemic flu can include things like frequent hand-washing, covering the face when coughing and sneezing and limiting close contact with other people, a practice known as social distancing, researchers note in Pediatrics. All of these things can be tricky with toddlers and preschoolers.    For the study, Shope and colleagues examined survey data collected from 1,500 daycare centers in 2008 and from 518 directors in 2016. They focused on licensed centers, and excluded home-based family childcare programs.    Few directors said they had written plans to for pandemic flu preparation, trained staff or communicated with parents about this possibility, the study found. Less than 5 percent of directors did these things, and this didn’t change significantly in the surveys done before and after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.    After adjusting for factors that might influence preparedness efforts, the only things that independently influenced whether directors had pandemic flu plans in place were their years of experience, use of heath care consultants to help create plans and perceived barriers to putting plans in place.    Barriers included things like not knowing what to do and lacking resources to put together plans.   One limitation of the study is that it relied on directors to report on practices in place at their centers, and researchers didn’t independently observe or verify infection control practices, the authors note.    Even so, the findings suggest it may make sense for parents choosing a daycare center to ask about the directors’ years of experience and whether the center uses a healthcare consultant, Dr. Laura Faherty, a pediatrician and physician policy researcher at the RAND Corporation in Boston who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    And even young children can be taught a little bit about infection control, said Dr. Susan Coffin, associate hospital epidemiologist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.   “Making sure everyone is immunized against seasonal flu every year is a great first step,” Coffin, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Additionally it is worth teaching children the behavioral things they can do to lessen their risk of acquiring infections such as washing hands regularly, throwing away used tissues and covering their coughs or sneezes.”  "
2r6XZoB,2017-05-15,Insomnia and sleep apnea rates are high and rising in the U.S. military," Insomnia cases have quadrupled, and sleep apnea cases have increased five-fold in the U.S. military over a decade, according to a recent study.   Rates of these two sleep disorders among service members are now about double those seen in the general U.S. population, the study team writes in the Journal of Sleep Research.   “Sleep disorders are a serious problem that interferes with the ability of soldiers to do their jobs effectively,” said senior study author Harris Lieberman of the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine in Natick, Massachusetts.   “When you’re sleep deprived, you can’t use your brain in the way soldiers need to do,” he told Reuters Health. “You’re unable to think at the level you can perform at when well-rested.”   The rising rates of military service members experiencing insomnia and sleep apnea over the past decade could affect operational readiness, wellbeing and healthcare costs, Lieberman’s team writes.   About 10 percent of the U.S. population experiences insomnia – trouble falling asleep or staying asleep - or obstructive sleep apnea, in which a person’s airway collapses multiple times during sleep. Both complaints are also rising in the civilian population, the authors point out, according to data from the National Health Interview Survey.    To investigate rates of insomnia and sleep apnea in the military, Lieberman and colleagues looked for cases between 2005 to 2014 in the Defense Medical Epidemiological Database, which keeps records of the medical encounters of active duty military personnel.    They found that medical visits for sleep apnea increased from 44 per 1,000 people per year in 2005 to 273 per 1,000 per year in 2014. Visits for insomnia increased from 16 per 1,000 per year in 2005 to 75 per 1,000 per year in 2014.    Obstructive sleep apnea was more common than insomnia throughout the time period, and the rates of encounters for apnea rose 3.5 times more than did rates of insomnia. In general, insomnia rates were higher among women, African Americans, people over age 40, enlisted personnel and in the Army, compared to other military branches.   Obstructive sleep apnea rates were highest among men, African Americans, senior officers, Army personnel and those over age 40.    “Problems with insomnia in the military is well-known, but we had no idea that sleep apnea had increased so dramatically,” Lieberman said. “We’ve had anecdotal information from talking to soldiers, but this was a new opportunity to look at the whole Defense Department.”   For future studies, Lieberman and colleagues will use several databases to try to understand potential causes for sleep disorders, such as deployment and number of times an individual has been deployed. This could include deployment-related circadian misalignments from crossing multiple time zones, mission-related sleep practices, uncomfortable sleeping environments or overuse of stimulants or hypnotics during operations, the study authors write.    Future research could shed light on civilian sleep issues as well.   “Because the U.S. military is such a large provider of health care, it has the opportunity to be a proving ground for large-scale evidence-based treatment dissemination and implementation,” said Daniel Taylor of the University of North Texas in Denton, who wasn’t involved in the study.   “We need to examine the health care costs of the different interventions being used for these disorders,” said Taylor, who has done studies of insomnia among U.S. military personnel and a trial of cognitive behavioral therapy to treat it. “For instance, hypnotic medications are often used for many months or years, and may be more expensive than the 6-10 sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy of insomnia.”   Given the infrastructure, the military may also provide a good way to compare various treatments being used, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or medication for insomnia, as well as surgery, positive air pressure or weight loss for obstructive sleep apnea, Taylor said.   “More and more of our service military members are suffering from, and hopefully getting treated for, these sleep disorders,” he said by email. “More needs to be done to make certain they’re getting the best treatment to return to their optimum level of functioning, both militarily and in their personal lives.”  "
2oxnD4d,2017-05-12,"Bigger, more expensive healthcare practices not necessarily better"," (Reuters Health) - You might not get what you pay for when it comes to healthcare, a new study suggests.   A report in Health Affairs found little association between how much physician practices charged and patients’ perceptions of their quality of care.   “We’re asking consumers to make a lot of decisions about healthcare purchasing without a lot of information. Price is not really a definitive signal of quality,” said lead author Eric T. Roberts, a health-services researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston.   “Practices with higher prices perform no better in terms of patients’ ratings of their care,” he said in a phone interview.   Working with nationwide databases, Roberts and his team looked at the fees practices had negotiated with commercial insurance companies. On average, high-price practices charged $84.45 for an office visit - 36 percent more than the charge at the average low-price practice, the study found.   Roberts and colleagues then looked at survey data and insurance claim information from more than 31,000 patients at those same practices who were insured through Medicare, the federal insurance policy for the elderly and disabled.    The researchers studied these patients because, under Medicare, the government sets non-negotiable fees. Medicare patients would have been unaware of the price differential and therefore would have been free from any influence of knowing the cost, making it easier for researchers to tell whether practices that negotiated above-average prices with commercial insurers for their non-Medicare patients delivered better care in general.   Medicare patients in high-price practices did report better coordination and management of their care, were more likely to see doctors within 15 minutes of scheduled appointments and were slightly more likely to receive flu and pneumonia vaccines. Otherwise, however, based on their survey responses, they didn’t feel they received more valuable care than patients in lower-price practices in the same geographic areas.    Researchers found no significant differences in overall ratings of care or doctors, timely access to care and interactions with primary physicians. Higher prices failed to lead to fewer hospitalizations, and patients in high-price practices were no more likely to get mammograms or other preventive or acute care.   The study debunks the myth that more expensive healthcare is superior healthcare, said Martin Gaynor, an economics and health policy professor at the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.    “Don’t just assume that because this practice is more expensive, the care is going to be better,” Gaynor, who was not involved with the study, said in a phone interview. “There’s no consistent finding across the board that quality is better for patients who go to more expensive practices.”   The authors conclude that the weak association they found between price and the quality of care calls into question providers’ claims that their higher prices signal higher-value care.   The study found that high-price practices were much larger in size than low-price practices, suggesting that “larger provider groups with market power are able to command substantially higher prices without having to offer markedly better care than smaller practices,” the authors say.   “There’s a widespread conception that bigger is better, and all of this leads to better outcomes for patients,” said senior author Dr. J. Michael McWilliams, a professor of healthcare policy at Harvard Medical School.    “We know it leads to higher prices. What has been less clear is whether it has led to higher quality,” he told Reuters Health. “And we’ve convincingly shown that large-scale consolidation does not benefit patients.”   Large practices, with on average 155 clinicians, charged 20 percent more on average for office visits than small ones, which had an average of 11 clinicians, the study found. Like patients in high-priced practices, patients in large practices reported shorter time spent in waiting rooms before seeing doctors, better care coordination and management and that they were more likely to receive pneumonia and flu vaccines than patients in small practices.   But patients perceived their care similarly in small and large physician practices, except that overall ratings of care tended to be worse in large practices than in small ones.   “Small practices in many ways do as well as large practices,” Gaynor said. “Bigger is not necessarily better. Sometimes bigger is worse.”  "
2pwtbeY,2017-05-12,Women using long-acting contraception less likely to use condoms," (Reuters Health) - College women using long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), like IUDs or hormonal implants, may be less likely to get pregnant but more vulnerable to sexually transmitted disease compared to peers not on LARCs, a U.S. study finds.   Among sexually active women, those who used LARC methods were more than two times less likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter than women not on a long-acting contraceptive, researchers report in the journal Sexually Transmitted Diseases.    “Long-acting reversible contraception, which includes intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, is one of the most effective ways to prevent pregnancy. While these methods are good at preventing pregnancy, there is no protection for sexually transmitted infections (STIs),” lead author Erika Thompson told Reuters Health in an email.   “One of the key findings is that condom use is lower among women using LARC methods compared to other forms of birth control (e.g., pill). Thus, LARC users may be placing themselves at risk for an STI because they are not using condoms for prevention,” said Thompson, a researcher at the Community and Family Health College of Public Health at the University of South Florida in Tampa.   Sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis were at an all time high in the U.S. in 2015, the study authors write. About half of new STIs occur in adolescents and young adults, they note.   Thompson’s team used data from the National College Health Assessment-II, a large survey-based study that examines the health status of U.S. college students.    The current study included 17,623 college women who were 18 years or older and reported having sex during the previous year. About 9 percent used a LARC method.    Researchers found that 24 percent of LARC users also used condoms in their last sexual encounter, compared to 57 percent of used a different contraceptive method plus a condom. This comparison excluded women whose only contraceptive was a condom.   Most of the LARC users were over 21 years old, white and had insurance, the authors point out. Black and Hispanic LARC users were more likely than whites to use a condom as well.    “Couples in relationships may want to consider talking to a healthcare provider about STI testing prior to stopping condom use. It is important to note that serial monogamy, or having successive sexual partners, does not remove the risk for STIs, so condoms should be used initially in a relationship,” Thompson said.   With the emergence of Zika Virus as a public health issue, this study may have applications to the prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus, she added.   “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the use of effective birth control methods and condoms to reduce the risk of a pregnancy affected by Zika,” Thompson said.   The study can shed light on which groups of women may be least likely to use condoms while on an effective form of birth control, Thompson said.   There were some limitations to the study, including  a low response rate to the survey. The study authors also didn’t take the length of relationships into consideration and they didn’t ask if study participants were aware of the risk of STIs.    “It is an interesting study though I do not think the findings are surprising. People choose LARC for many reasons, including that they, or their partner, do not like condoms,” Dr. Barbara M. Gripshover told Reuters Health in an email.    “More people chose this method who were in a relationship and therefore thought to be at less risk for STIs,” said Gripshover, medical director of the John T. Carey Special Immunology Unit at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio.   Gripshover, who wasn’t involved in the study, said that a couple can feel safe about not using condoms for STI prevention when both partners do not have an STI and they are in a monogamous relationship.

2qdSd4d,2017-05-12,"Surgery won’t help degenerative knee problems, experts say"," (Reuters Health) - Surgery won’t cure chronic knee pain, “locking,” “clicking,” a torn meniscus, or other problems related to knee arthritis, according to a panel of international experts.   Every year, more than two million people with degenerative knee problems have arthroscopic surgery, in which a surgeon inserts a tiny camera into the knee and uses small instruments to try to fix what’s wrong.   But guidelines published Wednesday in the British Medical Journal recommend against the procedure for just about everyone with knee arthritis.    “It does more harm than good,” Dr. Reed Siemieniuk, chair of the guideline panel, told Reuters Health by email. “Most patients experience improvement after arthroscopy, but in many cases, this is probably wrongly attributed to the surgery itself rather than to the natural course of the disease, a placebo effect, or (other) interventions like painkillers and exercise.”   In addition, the procedure is costly - up to $3 billion annually in the U.S. alone - and there’s a risk of rare but serious adverse effects such as blood clots or infection, said Siemieniuk, who works in the department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.   The panel, made up of surgeons, physical therapists, clinicians and patients, analyzed data from 13 randomized controlled trials - the gold standard way to test medical procedures - involving a total of 1,668 patients. The trials compared knee arthroscopy to conservative treatments such as exercise and painkillers.    The panelists also reviewed 12 less-rigorous studies of close to two million patients that looked at complications from the procedure.    After considering the balance of benefits, harms and burdens of knee arthroscopy, as well as the quality of the evidence for each outcome, the panel made a “strong recommendation against arthroscopy.”    The evidence shows a less than 15 percent probability of “small or very small improvement in short-term pain and function” from the procedure, and improvements would likely last less than a year, the panelists noted.    They thought it was more important to avoid postoperative limitations such as pain, swelling and restricted activity, and the risk of adverse effects.   “Chronic knee pain can be incredibly frustrating to live with - both for the person experiencing the pain and for their doctors,” Siemieniuk said. “The problem is that none of the current options cure the pain. Most people will continue to live with some pain even with weight loss, physical therapy, and painkillers. Knee replacement surgery also has important limitations and should be delayed as long as possible. So it’s no surprise that many placed their hopes in arthroscopic knee surgery.”   Still, he said, “We believe that no one or almost no one would want this surgery if they understand the evidence.”   If you have chronic knee pain, “double down on efforts for things we know work - for example, weight loss and physical therapy,” he advised.    “Also, talk to your healthcare provider (doctor, physical therapist) about strategies to reduce the physical stress on the knee that exacerbates the pain,” he added.   Dr. Joseph Bosco, vice-chair at NYU Langone Orthopedics in New York City, told Reuters Health, “In general I agree with the findings and support most of the conclusions.”    “The only issue is that in the study with the strongest evidence, the operative group did not do physical therapy,” he said by email. “That is not consistent with how we treat our patients. Almost all patients get physical therapy following knee arthroscopies.”   “Cortisone injections, physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medications work as well or better than surgery for most degenerative meniscal tears,” said Bosco, who was not involved in developing the guidelines.   However, he added, a small group of people “who (also) have mechanical symptoms, localized pain, and acute onset of pain will benefit, so a blanket recommendation against all surgery for degenerative meniscal tears is not appropriate.”  "
2qwsUxi,2017-05-11,Breast cancer treatment costs higher for younger women," (Reuters Health) - Younger women may face higher costs for breast cancer care than older patients at least in part because they’re diagnosed when tumors are more advanced and require more aggressive treatment, a recent U.S. study suggests.    For younger women aged 21 to 44, average treatment costs in the first year after a breast cancer diagnosis were $97,486 higher than average medical costs for similar women who didn’t have breast cancer, the study found.    By contrast, older women aged 45 to 64 had average treatment costs in the first year after a breast cancer diagnosis that were $75,737 more than their peers without breast cancer spent on healthcare in a year.    About 40 percent of the young cancer patients were diagnosed with what’s known as stage two tumors, when cancer has spread to lymph nodes surrounding the breast while just 34 percent of older women were diagnosed when cancer had reached stage two.    “Some of the difference in costs may be due to younger women being diagnosed at a higher stage of disease,” said Stacie Dusetzina, a pharmacy and public health researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who wasn’t involved in the study.   “However, younger patients may also be more likely to have faster growing cancers or to have more intense treatment,” Dusetzina said by email. “They may also receive higher intensity treatment because they are generally healthy and their doctors may be less concerned about the impact of treatment on other conditions.”   For the study, Benjamin Allaire of RTI International in Durham, North Carolina, and colleagues examined data from the North Carolina cancer registry linked to claims data from private health insurers from 2003 to 2010.    The analysis of treatment costs in the first year after a breast cancer diagnosis included 955 women with these tumors who were under age 45 as well as 134,427 similar women who weren’t diagnosed with breast malignancies.    It also included 4,082 women aged 45 to 64 with breast cancer and a comparison group of 299,663 similar women who weren’t diagnosed with these tumors.    Regardless of age, the cost of physician office and hospital outpatient visits accounted for roughly 90 percent of the difference between costs for women with and without breast cancer, researchers report in Breast Cancer Research and Treatment. Inpatient treatments and prescription drugs contributed just a small portion of the excess costs.    One limitation of the study is that researchers only examined data from one state involving women with one type of health benefit, the authors note. Results might look different for women in other parts of the U.S. or for patients with government health coverage like Medicare or people who were uninsured.    Researchers also didn’t have enough data on women with the most advanced types of breast cancer to compare costs by age for these malignancies.    Costs might also be higher for younger women because they’re more likely to choose a mastectomy to remove the breast, particularly if they have a genetic risk, said Dr. Anees Chagpar, director of the Breast Center at Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale-New Haven in Connecticut. Younger women may also be more likely to opt for breast reconstruction surgery, Chagpar, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “When you add up the costs for aggressive chemotherapy, surgery, reconstruction, and potentially radiation as well, this adds up to significant financial toxicity,” Chagpar said.   Beyond getting more intense care, younger women may also face higher out-of-pocket costs because they’re more likely to opt for insurance plans with lower monthly premiums and bigger co-payments or deductibles, said Dr. Alana Biggers, a researcher at the University of Illinois-Chicago College of Medicine who wasn’t involved in the study.    “Women should look for insurance that will pay for preventive measures such as mammograms,” Biggers said by email. “Also, women can reduce their risk of breast cancer by eliminating smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising.”  "
2pDWXiM,2017-05-11,Help brains by cooling bodies after cardiac arrest," (Reuters Health) - People who are left unconscious after their heart suddenly stops should be cooled in an effort to preserve brain function, according to the American Academy of Neurology.   Reducing a comatose person’s body temperature down to 32 to 34 degrees Celsius (C) - about 90 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit (F) - for 24 hours after rescuing them from cardiac arrest is highly likely to improve brain outcomes, says the organization’s new guideline.   “This issue with brain protection after cardiac resuscitation has been an active topic in the academic literature for a number of years,” said Dr. Alejandro Rabinstein, a co-author of the new guideline and a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.   Rabinstein and his colleagues write in the journal Neurology that only about 6 percent to 10 percent of patients who suffer a cardiac arrest outside of a hospital survive long enough to eventually return home.   If the heart does get restarted, one of the main factors that determines the ultimate outcome is brain health, Rabinstein said.   Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating. As a result, oxygen-rich blood stops flowing to the brain, and brain tissue begins to die. The heart may recover, but the brain may be badly damaged.   “Improving neurological outcomes is really improving overall outcomes,” said Rabinstein.   For the new guideline, the authors examined evidence on body cooling after cardiac arrest published from 1966 through August 2016.   Based on the results of two studies, they recommend cooling - known as therapeutic hypothermia - for 24 hours at 32 to 34 degrees C after a cardiac arrest in comatose patients whose heart rhythm was restored with a shock from a defibrillator outside of a hospital.   The authors also say that cooling a person to 36 degrees C (about 97 degrees F) for 24 hours, warming the person to 37 degrees C (98.6 degrees F) and then maintaining them at 37.5 degrees C (99.5 degrees F) is likely just as good as cooling the body to a lower temperature for a day.   Rabinstein said the techniques are more likely to be effective when the so-called out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was witnessed by others and when the heart could be shocked back to a normal rhythm.   “Lowering the body temperature . . . for 24 hours after cardiac arrest should be the standard of care because it improved neurological outcomes,” he said.   As for why cooling the body is beneficial after cardiac arrest, Rabinstein said that’s not clear yet. The benefit may come from the actual cooling or it may come from the cooling preventing fevers, which are bad for the brain and known to occur after cardiac arrest.   Methods for cooling the body include use of chilled intravenous fluids and special vests and other pieces of clothing.   Therapeutic hypothermia is the standard of care for unconscious cardiac arrest patients, said Dr. Leslie Cho, who is section head of preventive cardiology at Cleveland Clinic.   “We let the body cool for 24 to 36 hours,” said Cho, who was not involved with the new study. “Then, we slowly re-warm the body. As we re-warm the body, in most patients within 72 hours when they get to normal temperature we can assess what their brain function is.”   She emphasized that not all people who survive cardiac arrest need therapeutic hypothermia since some wake up after their heart starts beating again.   “Thankfully, it has provided tremendous benefit in certain people,” Cho said.   Rabinstein said family members of people who are unresponsive after cardiac arrest should ask about the treatment. If the medical center isn’t equipped to perform therapeutic hypothermia, the patient should be transferred to a facility with that capability.   “There is an underutilization of this strategy across the United States and we want to create awareness among the general public that this is a treatment that works,” he said.  "
2pBKkUE,2017-05-11,"Cracking, popping joints may foretell arthritis"," (Reuters Health) - Grating, cracking or popping sounds around joints may predict future arthritis, especially in the knees, according to a recent U.S. study.   Among thousands of people with no knee pain who were followed for three years, one quarter had noisy knees yet they made up three quarters of the cases of symptomatic knee arthritis that emerged by the end of the study period, researchers found.    “Many people who have signs of osteoarthritis on X-rays do not necessarily complain about pain. Presently, there are no known strategies for preventing the development of pain in this group,” said lead study author Grace Lo of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.   Especially when people have joint space loss or other arthritis-related changes visible on X-rays, their also having noisy knees can be considered a sign of higher risk for developing pain within the next year, she said.   Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting more than 30 million adults in the United States, Lo and colleagues write in Arthritis Care and Research. Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, which means X-ray evidence of arthritis plus pain or stiffness, affects about 16 percent of adults older than 60, they note.   Lo and colleagues analyzed data from 3,495 participants ranging in age from about 50 to 70 in a long-term study conducted in hospitals in Rhode Island, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland. None had symptomatic knee arthritis at the start.    The researchers looked at how often people experienced knee pain, stiffness and “crepitus,” or noises and scraping feelings in their knees.    During clinic visits, people were asked questions like, “Do you feel grinding, hear clicking or any other type of noise when your right knee moves?” and “During the past 12 months, have you had pain, aching or stiffness in or around your right knee on most days for at least one month?” The patients were evaluated at the beginning of the study and again at 12, 24 and 36 months. X-rays were also taken once a year.     At the start, 65 percent of participants said they had no crepitus, 11 percent experienced it “rarely,” 15 percent had it “sometimes” and 9 percent had it “often” or “always.”   Overall, 635 participants, 18 percent, developed symptomatic arthritis of the knee during the study period.    Even after adjusting for weight and other factors, researchers found that odds of developing symptomatic arthritis rose along with the frequency of crepitus. Those who reported it “rarely” had 50 percent higher risk than those who never had it, and those with crepitus “sometimes” or “often” had about double the odds.    People with crepitus “always” were three times more likely to develop arthritis over four years than those who never had it.   Older age and having crepitus also increased the likelihood of developing arthritis, and men with crepitus were more likely than women with noisy knees to go on to develop arthritis.   “Differences across genders is interesting and unexplained. This may tell us about differences in symptom reporting or the biology of osteoarthritis,” said Daniel Solomon, the chair of arthritis and population health at Harvard Medical School in Boston.    “Knowing how to predict who will develop symptomatic osteoarthritis may give patients and providers clues to who should receive earlier treatment or even prevention,” Solomon, who wasn’t involved in the study, told Reuters Health by email.   “It would be helpful to look at the MRIs of the people who had X-ray evidence, no pain and always had crepitus to understand what is happening in their knees,” Lo said. “This could help identify ways to decrease the risk for developing knee pain.”   Since MRI scans are more sensitive than X-rays, Lo added, researchers for future studies may be able to see osteophyte formations or other symptoms around the knee that they can’t usually see.   “Not all noises coming from a knee are a bad sign,” she said. “It might be helpful to ask your doctor for an X-ray to see if you have evidence of osteoarthritis and then take precautions from there.”  "
2pDoAYZ,2017-05-11,Smoking only in social situations may still be tied to heart problems," (Reuters Health) - So-called social smokers who only light up on special occasions may have some of the same risks for heart disease as people with a daily cigarette habit, a U.S. study suggests.                     A woman lights a cigarette in this illustration picture taken in Paris, October 8, 2014. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann      For the study, researchers examined data on smoking habits, cholesterol levels and blood pressure for a nationally representative sample of 39,555 adults. Most people said they didn’t smoke, while roughly 17 percent were current smokers and about 10 percent were social smokers who didn’t have a daily habit but did regularly smoke in certain situations.    Compared with non-smokers, social smokers were more than twice as likely to have high blood pressure - known as hypertension - and 53 percent more likely to have elevated cholesterol, the study found. Social smokers had the roughly the same odds of having these risk factors for heart disease as current smokers in the study.    “These results provide strong evidence that smoking, regardless of amount, is an even stronger indicator of cardiovascular risk than previously thought,” said lead study author Kate Gawlik, a researcher at the Ohio State University College of Nursing in Columbus.   “Social smoking is still a major cardiovascular health risk,” Gawlik said by email. “No amount of smoking is safe.”   Researchers defined cardiovascular health based on blood pressure and total cholesterol levels. And before accounting for other heart health risk factors like weight, age, gender and race or ethnicity, social smokers were found to have lower rates of high blood pressure than current smokers.   But after adjusting for the other risk factors, rates of hypertension were similar for current and social smokers, 76 percent and 75 percent, respectively, a difference too small to rule out the possibility that it was due to chance.    High cholesterol rates were also similar after adjusting for other risk factors: 53 percent for social smokers and 55 percent for current smokers.    Social smoking was most common among adults 40 and under, researchers report in the American Journal of Health Promotion. Social smokers were also more likely to be male and Hispanic.    Study participants were screened from 2012 to 2016 as part of a cardiovascular health education program. Participants reported their own smoking habits and had clinicians check their blood pressure and total cholesterol.    The study isn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how much social smoking impacts heart health compared to other patterns of tobacco use. It also didn’t assess the long-term health effects of smoking, only the presence of certain risk factors for heart disease.    Another limitation of the study is that researchers lacked data on prior smoking behavior, the authors note. Participants also volunteered to join the study instead of being randomly selected, which might make the results less reliable.    It’s also possible that not all of the participants had chronic high blood pressure, said Michael Cummings, co-leader of the tobacco research program at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. That’s because blood pressure readings may spike after someone smokes without being regularly elevated when they aren’t using nicotine, Cummings, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    But that doesn’t make any amount of smoking safe, Cummings said.   “Every cigarette you smoke does your body damage,” Cummings added. “For someone predisposed to cardiac disease for whatever reason, exposure to cigarette smoke stresses the heart and increases the risk of serious cardiac problems.”   Heart problems associated with smoking don’t need to be permanent, however, said Dr. Stanton Glantz, director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco.   “Any smoking is bad,” Glantz, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “The good news is that, unless the smoking has caused a heart attack, the effects go away when you stop.”  "
2q2MTm1,2017-05-11,UK military health workers feel ill-equipped to manage women’s care," Although women make up a tenth of the UK military, many medical workers feel they don’t have the training or guidance to handle women’s health issues among troops on deployment, a small study found.   In the survey of Afghanistan-based UK medical staff, more than half said they felt “underprepared to handle gynecological conditions confidently,” researchers report in the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps. One third of respondents thought gynecology should be added to predeployment medical training, and two thirds wanted guidelines on the subject.   Currently 10 percent of the UK military and 15 percent of the U.S. military is made up of women and these numbers are on the rise, said Elspeth Ritchie, author of the book “Women at War,” who wasn’t involved in the study.    Though women make up a significant part of the military, they are more likely to leave than men, and one of the reasons for this may be issues with gynecological treatment, said Ritchie, a retired army psychiatrist who currently works for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington D.C.   “If patients think that clinicians are not competent, they won’t go and seek treatment, so they may ignore early signs and that may lead to problems,” Ritchie told Reuters Health by email.   To assess how confident military medical staff feel in managing women’s health on deployment, Major Magdalena Thiel of Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, UK, and her colleagues gave questionnaires to 44 randomly selected military doctors, nurses and medical technicians working in Afghanistan.   More than half of the participants said they treated one or more gynecological conditions per month, and four doctors said they treated five or more gynecological problems per month.   More than half, 53 percent, of the medical staff, said they felt underprepared to confidently manage women’s health problems. And only 55 percent of participants said they had enough equipment to properly manage gynecological conditions.    Two thirds of the staff said they would be willing to attend a short course on the subject of women’s healthcare. About one third of medical personnel thought that gynecology should be included in medical predeployment training.    A large majority, 65 percent, of military medical workers wanted management guidelines for gynecology to be included among the Clinical Guidelines for Operations, a guidebook for best medical practices.    The study team declined to comment on the results.   “The number of women in the military is growing, and more are serving in deployed environments and leadership positions,” said Kevin Dwyer, chief of media operations at the Defense Health Agency, which provides combat support for the health of U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force members.    The healthcare needs of service women are regularly evaluated and addressed, Dwyer, who wasn’t involved in the UK study, told Reuters Health by email.    He cited a 2015 report from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs which, in response to a request from Congress, details programs and policies the U.S. military has in place to meet “the specific gender health needs of women in various deployed environments.”     According to the report, there is no military-wide policy or protocol to address women’s health, but there are efforts being made to standardize education and training on women’s health.   Among these, experts from the Army Women’s Health Task Force (WHTF) and the U.S. Army Public Health Command have created the online Women’s Health Portal, which provides female service members with updated and evidence-based recommendations for women’s health screening and links to women’s health support resources.    The WHTF also created a women’s health-specific decision making tool for medics out in the field and other healthcare providers to help determine what they can treat and what conditions require women to be evacuated, the report notes.   Military medical attention is often focused on more serious injuries, Ritchie noted. “Our providers also need to think about prevention and basic health issues.”  "
2qLgYHO,2017-05-10,Billions saved because FDA didn&#039;t rush approval of Alzheimer&#039;s drug," The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s decision not to rush approval for Eli Lilly’s experimental Alzheimer’s treatment solanezumab - a drug that turned out to be ineffective - may have saved American taxpayers as much as $100 billion over the past four years, an analysis concludes.   The analysis comes amid pressure on FDA to use less-strict standards in deciding whether a drug should be approved. Some agency critics have called on the government to approve all drugs that are not toxic and let market forces determine which are best.   “The issue right now in the national conversation is this push to approve drugs faster and faster at all costs,” researcher Dr. Chana Sacks of Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston told Reuters Health.    “The conversation usually focuses on the toxicity - the risks and benefits - of the drugs themselves. We wanted to think about the financial toxicity, which is very real, and what the financial implications might be of lowering standards,” she said.   In the case of solanezumab, final-phase testing of the drug showed it was no better than placebo, Sacks and colleagues reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.   The drug was designed to clear the amyloid plaques long believed to play a role in the incurable disease, which slowly robs people of their mental abilities.   Two tests announced in 2012 found that it didn’t improve cognitive or functional abilities in people with mild or moderate Alzheimer’s, but hope for the drug remained alive after Lilly said it reduced cognitive deterioration among people with mild dementia by 34 percent, an accurate but misleading figure.   In fact, on a 90-point scale, solanezumab recipients showed an improvement of a mere 1.7 points. Reporting results as percentages can often make small improvements appear much more dramatic.   “Lilly’s 2012 announcement led to hope that solanezumab could alter the disease’s course, although perhaps only for patients at an earlier stage of disease,” the researchers write in a commentary.   After the results of the final test, known as Expedition 3, were announced in 2016, Lilly abandoned the drug as an Alzheimer’s treatment.    If solanezumab had been approved in 2012 based on a looser standard that only required a hint of effectiveness, billions would have been spent before it was discovered that it didn’t work, Sacks and her colleagues write.   And discovery of its ineffectiveness would have taken much longer because it would have been harder to get volunteers to sign up for a study where they might get a placebo instead of the drug.   “These studies, if they are performed, are often not completed until many years after marketing begins,” the Sacks team notes. Meanwhile, Medicare would have had to pay for an ineffective drug.   Although Lilly never announced a price, it’s not unusual for such drugs to cost $14,000 to nearly $30,000 a year.   “Even conservative estimates suggest that the total costs of solanezumab would have been staggering,” the research team writes. “Of the more than 5 million people in the United States with Alzheimer’s disease, about half can be categorized as having mild disease, the subgroup initially thought to benefit from solanezumab. If the price had been set at $10,000 per patient per year and just one tenth of those patients had been treated, the cost would have been almost $10 billion over the past four years.”   If half the eligible population had used it and the cost had been $20,000 a year, total spending would have hit $100 billion over the first four years of sales and marketing.   Even that estimate may have been low, said Sacks. “Current regulatory standards prevented ineffective medications from reaching patients and averted unnecessary spending (as well as unanticipated side effects),” the research team writes. “The public and private funds not spent on a useless drug remained available for other interventions that have been proven to work.”   Lilly, asked for reaction to the commentary, released a statement: “The emotional and economic toll this disease, if left untreated, takes on society and families is astronomical. While the results of Expedition 3 were not what we had hoped for, Lilly will continue to focus on finding disease-modifying therapies, diagnostics and solutions to ultimately help the 47 million people worldwide who are waiting for a cure of this horrific disease. We remain committed to Alzheimer’s disease research, as we have been for nearly 30 years.”  "
2qYBDoX,2017-05-09,Cotton-tip swabs send dozens of kids to the ER every day," (Reuters Health) - Almost three dozen children end up in U.S. hospital emergency departments every day thanks to injuries that result from using cotton-tipped swabs to clean their ears, according to a new study.   The highest rate of emergency department visits for ear injuries from cotton swabs was in children up to age 3, the researchers found.   “It highlights the misconception that adults and children need to clean the ear canal in the home setting,” said senior author Dr. Kris Jatana, a pediatric ear, nose and throat surgeon at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. “While cotton-tipped applicators may seem harmless, there are certainly a lot of potential risks to using them to clean the ears.”   Jatana and colleagues write in the Journal of Pediatrics that cotton-tipped swabs were created in the 1920s to clean babies’ ears, but reports of ear injuries eventually came to light.   “The injuries can range from minor to severe,” Jatana told Reuters Health.   The researchers analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, which contains nationally representative data from U.S. emergency departments, to assess the extent of ear injuries in children due to cotton-tipped swabs.   They estimate that overall, 263,338 children under age 18 were seen at U.S. emergency departments between 1990 and 2010 for ear injuries tied to the use of these products.   The yearly number of visits for this reason rose from 9,794 in 1990 to 17,449 in 2001, but then declined to 12,911 in 2010.   About 40 percent of emergency visits were due to a feeling of something stuck in the children’s ears. About 35 percent of visits were due to bleeding, and about 17 percent were due to ear pain.   After examination, about 30 percent of children were diagnosed with a foreign body in their ears. A quarter of children were diagnosed with broken eardrums, technically known as tympanic membrane perforations. About 23 percent were diagnosed with soft tissue injuries to the ear.   Almost all the children were treated in the emergency department and released without needing to be hospitalized, the researchers found.    About 40 percent of injuries occurred among children up to age 3, and about 67 percent occurred among those under age 8.   In nearly two-thirds of the cases, the researchers had information on where the injury occurred - and almost all happened at home.    When they were able to document the cause of the injury, the majority were due to cleaning.   “We’ve learned over the years that it’s not a safe practice to insert this product into ears,” said Jatana.   Even ear, nose and throat doctors wouldn’t use cotton-tipped swabs to clean out earwax, said Dr. Cuneyt Alper, a pediatric ear, nose and throat specialist at the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC.   “We use different instruments ourselves,” said Alper, who was not involved with the new research.   Serious injuries to the ear canal or the eardrum are rare, according to Dr. Alyssa Hackett, a pediatric ear, nose and throat specialist with New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai in New York.   “More commonly, the wax is pushed deep into the ear canal instead of removed by the cotton swab which can cause a temporary hearing loss similar to the feeling of having an ear plug in the ear,” said Hackett, who also wasn’t involved with the new research.   She added in an email to Reuters Health that ear wax deep in a child’s ear can be difficult and painful for a doctor to remove. It may also make diagnosing an ear infection difficult or impossible.   Instead, Alper recommends using a cotton ball to remove visible wax from the entrance to a child’s ear.   Parents should “go after the wax that they see,” he told Reuters health. “Ear canals are self cleaning - typically - unless the wax is pushed in.”   Jatana said using soapy water and a washcloth at bath time should also do a satisfactory job.

2q0qRAQ,2017-05-09,"Bullied teens more likely to smoke, drink and use drugs"," (Reuters Health) - Children who are bullied in fifth grade are more likely to become depressed and experiment with drugs and alcohol during their teen years than their peers who weren’t victimized by other kids, a U.S. study suggests.                     FILE PHOTO - A cigarette burns in an ashtray at a pub in Prague, Czech Republic, May 8, 2017. REUTERS/David W Cerny      Researchers followed almost 4,300 students starting in fifth grade, when they were around 11 years old. By tenth grade, 24 percent of the teens drank alcohol, 15 percent smoked marijuana and 12 percent used tobacco.    More frequent episodes of physical and emotional bullying in fifth grade were associated with higher odds of depression by seventh grade, which was in turn linked to greater likelihood of substance use later in adolescence, the study found.    “We drew on the self-medication hypothesis when trying to understand why peer victimization may lead to substance use over time,” said lead study author Valerie Earnshaw, a human development and family studies researcher at the University of Delaware in Newark.     “This suggests that people use substances to try to relieve painful feelings or control their emotions,” Earnshaw said by email. “So, youth who are bullied feel bad, or experience depressive symptoms, and then may use substances to try to feel better.”   For the study, researchers examined data from three surveys conducted from 2004 to 2011 among students at schools in Houston, Los Angeles and Birmingham, Alabama.   Students were asked if they had used tobacco, alcohol or marijuana in the past 30 days and how often they had been victims of bullying by their peers in the previous year. Questions on peer victimization touched on both physical aggression like shoving and kicking as well as emotional taunts like saying nasty things about them to other kids.    At the start of the study in fifth grade, about 10 percent of participants said they had been victims of bulling. This was more common among kids who had chronic illnesses, sexual minorities and boys.     By seventh grade, almost 2 percent of the students reported symptoms of depression.    And by the end of the study in tenth grade, substance use was more common among the kids who had previously reported bullying and depression.    The study isn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove that bullying directly causes depression or that mental health issues directly cause substance use. Another limitation of the study is its reliance on teens to accurately report any episodes of bullying, symptoms of depression or substance use, the authors note.    It’s also possible that teens who are bullied may later wind up drinking or using drugs because their peer groups include many adolescents who do both of these things, whether on sports teams or among crowds of particularly aggressive kids, said Bonnie Leadbeater, a psychology researcher at the University of Victoria in Canada.    “Being ‘trapped’ in these networks can be particularly problematic in high school, where you see the same people every day,” Leadbeater, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    “Youth with multiple networks beyond school through sports, music, art, religious activities, volunteering and work are more apt to find friends and others who see their talents, strengths and abilities,” Leadbeater added. “These strengths are often established in late elementary school.”   The trouble with bullying that leads to mental health problems is that teens with depression and anxiety are more likely to withdraw from peers and lack interest in most things.   “Young teens need to have ways of dealing with peer conflict before it becomes bullying,” Leadbeater said. “Young teens need to believe that getting help is normative and that bullying is not.”  "
2poNXBo,2017-05-09,Obamacare spared some families from medical financial catastrophe," (Reuters Health) - Americans who bought health insurance on their own or in government marketplaces were less likely to go broke from the strain of medical costs under Obamacare than before the law took effect.                    FILE PHOTO - The federal government forms for applying for health coverage are seen at a rally held by supporters of the Affordable Care Act, widely referred to as ""Obamacare"", outside the Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center in Jackson, Mississippi October 4, 2013. REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman      A study published in Health Affairs this week found a nearly 7 percent drop in the number of consumers under age 65 with non-group health insurance who experienced a qualified “medical financial burden” between 2013 and 2015.    The authors defined a qualified burden as when a family spends more than 10 percent of its annual income on health insurance and medical costs.    Obamacare, known formally as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), was signed into law in 2010 and fully implemented in 2014. It is under attack in the U.S. Congress, where the House of Representatives has approved a bill to repeal major parts of the law and replace it with a Republican healthcare plan.    “Overall, the data provide a pretty clear signal that nonelderly people with non-group health insurance coverage did experience financial relief after the implementation of the ACA,” lead author Michel Boudreaux said in a phone interview.   He urged lawmakers to consider his study’s findings before deciding the future of healthcare.   Boudreaux, a professor of health-services administration at the University of Maryland in College Park, and his colleagues examined nationally representative survey data for more than 450,000 people in families in which everyone was under age 65.   In the non-group market - that is, people who purchased health insurance and did not get it from an employer or the government - the medical financial burden rate fell 6.7 percent from 2013 to 2015, after adjusting for other factors, the study found.    Among Americans eligible for government health-insurance subsidies, the medical financial burden rate fell 10 percent, the study found.    In 2013, families without group coverage spent an average of $7,835 on health insurance premiums and medical care. By 2015, the average cost dropped 10 percent to $7,024.    Despite the reductions, however, more than one-third of those with non-group health insurance still lived in families shouldering a medical financial burden in 2015, the authors write.    Laura Wherry, professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, said she was encouraged by the study’s findings. But she remains concerned that people who buy insurance privately or through government exchanges still are struggling to pay for coverage and medical costs.   “This study suggests that individuals in the non-group market are better off as a result of the ACA but that they remain particularly vulnerable to experiencing substantial financial burden associated with insurance and medical care,” she said in an email.   The U.S. Senate is now considering whether to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the American Health Care Act.   “Any changes to the ACA that would allow insurers to cut covered services or charge higher premiums for individuals with pre-existing health conditions are certain to increase this financial burden and ultimately make care unaffordable for those with significant medical needs,” Wherry said.   The ACA prevents insurers from charging higher rates for people with so-called pre-existing conditions, a common practice before its implementation. It also requires insurers to cover 10 essential health benefits, such as maternity care and prescription drugs.   The Republican bill passed on Thursday would allow states to opt out of those provisions. While insurers could not deny people insurance because of pre-existing conditions, they would be allowed to charge as much as they want.    As lawmakers consider the fate of Obamacare, health-policy analysts and economists are beginning to release findings of examinations into the successes and failures of former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement.   A Consumer Reports investigation concluded this week that Obamacare slashed personal bankruptcies by 50 percent. ( ti.me/2q0xy5O )    “Although courts never ask people to declare why they’re filing, many bankruptcy and legal experts agree that medical bills had been a leading cause of personal bankruptcy before public healthcare coverage expanded under the ACA,” the report says.    Improvements to the economy and changes to bankruptcy laws also would have contributed to the reduction in filings, the report says. But, the author adds, experts “almost all agreed that expanded health coverage played a major role in the marked, recent decline.”  "
2qSTjSn,2017-05-09,Experimental drug reduces thyroid-associated ‘Graves&#039; eyes’," (Reuters Health) - The experimental orphan drug teprotumumab significantly reduces the eye bulging associated with Graves’ disease, according to results of a small trial.   Among the 88 participants with moderate-to-severe disease who were given intravenous infusions of either teprotumumab or a dummy drug every three weeks for eight treatments, 43 percent who got the real drug had a reduction of at least 2 millimeters in eye protrusion by the sixth week compared to 4 percent in the placebo group.   “In virtually all the responders, the changes are frequently what anyone would call dramatic,” said lead study author Dr. Terry Smith of the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.    The eyes don’t have that bulging appearance, he said, and many of them return to the degree of bulging they had before they got the disease.    “That’s something that we almost never see in someone who’s manifested the degree of disease one needed to have in order to get into the study,” Smith said.   The marked reduction in bulging is similar to that reported after decompression surgery, Smith and his colleagues write in the New England Journal of medicine.     Graves’ disease is the most common cause of overactive thyroid in the United States, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). It is an autoimmune disorder, in which the immune system attacks the thyroid gland.    Certain immune-system signaling molecules also target other tissues in the body, including in the eyes, which causes their bulging appearance, sometimes known as Graves’ eyes. About 30 percent of people with Graves’ disease develop mildly bulging eyes, and 2 to 5 percent develop severe bulge. This eye condition usually lasts one to two years and often improves on its own, according to NIDDK.   Teprotumumab blocks one of these immune signaling molecules, so researchers wanted to see what effect it might have on the eyes of Graves’ patients with moderate to severe bulge.   The study “included some of the worst cases imaginable and we’re now wondering whether the drug might find expanded utility in much-less-severe disease,” Smith told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.    By week 24, the response rate was 69 percent with the drug and 20 percent with placebo. Among those who completed therapy, the rates were 79 percent and 22 percent, respectively.   More people who received the drug had sizeable reductions in disease activity and reductions of 3 mm or more in eye bulge compared to the placebo group, the researchers note.   However, while only 10 percent of patients who received the drug had double vision before the study, that rose to 50 percent by 24 weeks.    High blood sugar was also a key side effect in participants who already had diabetes, the study team notes, but adjusting diabetes medications solved that problem.   The typical treatment for Graves’ eyes is glucocorticoids, which are not always effective and also have side effects, the study team notes.   The drug, also known as RV001 or R1507, has been developed by Genmab and Roche. River Vision Development Corporation licensed the drug from Roche. On Monday, Horizon Pharma announced that it was acquiring River Vision, which paid for the new study.   Smith said FDA approval could come sometime in 2018. Enrollment in a follow-up trial is expected to begin within six weeks.   The duration of response to the autoimmune inflammatory disease, along with the quick response to initial therapy, suggests fewer infusions may be just as effective, “but future studies will sort that out,” Smith said.   The researchers also cautioned that the study only included volunteers with active disease of recent onset so “the potential of teprotumumab in benefiting patients with milder, less active, or stable disease was not assessed.”  "
2prAoNT,2017-05-08,Greater total pollution exposure tied to higher cancer risk," Living in areas with higher total exposures to harmful pollutants in the air, water and land is associated with greater odds of developing cancer, a U.S. study suggests.    While plenty of previous research has linked individual pollutants to increased risks of specific types of cancer, the current study focused on how the combined effect of exposure to a variety of environmental contaminants may influence the risk of tumors.    Researchers examined the annual incidence rate for cancer diagnoses for each county in the U.S. and found an average of 451 cases for every 100,000 people. Compared to counties with the highest environmental quality, counties that ranked the lowest had an average of 39 more cancer cases each year for every 100,000 residents.   “We do not experience exposures in a vacuum but rather are exposed to several exposures at any one time,” said lead study author Dr. Jyotsna Jagai, of the University of Illinois at Chicago.    “We considered a broad definition of environmental exposures, which included pollution in the air, water, and land and also (man-made) and sociodemographic environmental factors,” Jagai said by email. “We found that counties with poor overall environmental quality experienced higher cancer incidence than those counties with good overall environmental quality.”   Cancer causes one in four deaths in the U.S. each year, Jagai and colleagues note in the journal Cancer.   To assess the connection between environmental quality and cancer risk, the researchers examined county-by-county data on exposure to different pollutants from 2000 to 2005 and on new cancer diagnoses from 2006 to 2010.   Compared to men in counties with the highest environmental quality, men living in counties with the poorest environmental quality had an average of 33 more cases of all types of cancer for every 100,000 people. For women, living in counties with the worst environmental quality was associated with an average of 30 more cases of cancer for every 100,000 people.   In addition to looking at overall cancer rates, researchers also looked separately at the most common tumor types: lung, colorectal, prostate and breast malignancies.    Prostate and breast tumors were strongly associated with environmental quality, the study found. Living in the counties with the worst environmental quality was tied to about 10 more cases of these tumors for every 100,000 people.    One limitation of the study is that researchers may not have had enough years of data to fully assess the connection between pollutants and cancer because some slow-growing tumors might appear many years after exposure to pollutants, the authors note.    Researchers also lacked data on individuals’ lifestyle factors that can influence cancer risk, such as alcohol use, exercise habits and nutrition.    “We do have to be careful about drawing conclusions from studies of neighborhood factors that lack detailed information on characteristics of individuals living in those neighborhoods because the observed associations could very well be due to attributes of the individuals rather than the environment itself,” said Scarlett Lin Gomez, author of an accompanying editorial and a researcher at the Cancer Prevention Institute of California and the Stanford Cancer Institute.    “However, neighborhood environment has been consistently shown to have its own impacts on health and on cancer over and above individual characteristics,” Gomez said by email.

2pszBwe,2017-05-08,Early puberty tied to increased risk of dating abuse," (Reuters Health) - Girls who go through puberty sooner may be more likely to experience dating abuse than their peers who develop later, a U.S. study suggests.    Having more male friends may also make dating violence more likely, the study also found.    “Girls who make an early transition to puberty look more mature than their later-maturing peers and that makes them attractive to boys, including those who are in their friendship group,” said senior study author Sara Jaffee of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.    “Statistically speaking, the more friends they have who are boys, the greater the odds that some of those boys will be abusive in a dating relationship,” Jaffee said by email. “Moreover, girls who make an early transition to puberty are at risk for low self-esteem and for depression, and these characteristics may give them fewer coping skills to leave relationships that ultimately become abusive.”   Puberty in girls typically starts around age 10 or 11, but can sometimes begin much earlier. Girls usually undergo hormonal shifts and start developing breasts before they begin menstruating. This process is starting sooner today than it did a generation ago, and though the exact reasons aren’t clear, rising obesity rates are suspected to be one factor contributing to the shift.    For the current study, researchers examined data on a nationally representative sample of 3,870 adolescent girls, based on surveys conducted starting in 1994 when participants were 13 to 17 years old.    All of the participants had experienced at least one sexual relationship, and about two-thirds of them had only had one.    The researchers asked the girls if their partners ever insulted them in public, swore at them, threatened them with violence, pushed or shoved them in public, or threw something at them.   Girls who went through puberty sooner were more likely to be dating and more likely to have experienced such abuse in these relationships, researchers report in Pediatrics.    Having more relationships, being older, living in a family with lower household income, having lower self-esteem, and engaging in more antisocial behaviors at the start of the study were also associated with higher odds of dating abuse. White girls reported more abuse than Hispanic girls, the study also found.    One limitation of the study is that researchers relied on teens to accurately report and recall on the timing of puberty and on any sexual relationships or abuse, the authors note.    Even so, the findings add to a growing body of evidence linking early puberty in girls to higher odds of dating violence, said Catherine Mary Schooling, a public health researcher at the City University of New York who wasn’t involved in the study.    Because some evidence links obesity to earlier puberty, the findings should offer parents another reminder of the importance of helping children maintain a healthy weight, Schooling said by email.    Another problem is that girls’ bodies may be developing faster than their brains, said Bruce Taylor, a public health researcher at the University of Chicago who wasn’t involved in the study.    “(With) early puberty onset girls’ bodies are telling them that they are ready for adult-like behavior but developmentally their minds are not ready and are still operating like an adolescent’s brain which has not developed the appropriate coping skills to address relationship conflicts,” Taylor said by email.    “The early-puberty-onset girls are generally at greater risk for behavioral and emotional problems, and the matter is exacerbated by having more opportunities for problems by having a larger friendship group of boys,” Taylor added.   "
2q8okoZ,2017-05-05,Type of prostate cancer surgery tied to later quality of life," (Reuters Health) - The quality of life men have after prostate cancer is influenced by the type of treatment they choose, a recent study confirms.   Researchers found that two years out, patients do better in areas like sexual function and urinary incontinence after having certain currently available treatments versus others.   “Prostate cancer is very, very common,” said lead author Dr. Gary Chien, who is director of the urology residency program at Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles. “One out of five men are diagnosed with it in their lifetime. In addition to cancer cure one of the things physicians and patients want to achieve is quality of life.”   Chien and colleagues write in BJU International that previous studies examined whether men could be cured and preserve their urinary and sexual function. Many of those studies were not comprehensive and many are out of date, they authors add.   For the new study, the researchers analyzed surveys completed by 5,727 men in the Kaiser Permanente health system who were diagnosed with prostate cancer from March 2011 to January 2014. The men averaged 64 years old.   Participants answered surveys about their quality of life before their treatment and again one, three, six, 12, 18 and 24 months later - until November 2014. The survey asked about urinary incontinence and irritation, sexual function, bowel function and hormone issues.   Overall, 2,389 men had active surveillance, which only monitors the cancer without intervening, 1,861 had their prostates removed with robotic surgery and 828 had the hormone treatment known as androgen-deprivation therapy. Another 309 had external radiation, 199 had their prostates removed with traditional open surgery, 132 had internal radiation and nine had cryoblation, a technique to destroy the tumor by freezing it.   The researchers found that sexual function declined after all treatments, compared to the active surveillance group. Men who had their prostates surgically removed had the greatest decline in function, but it was less severe with the robotic procedure compared to men who had open surgery.   By the end of 24 months, men who had the robotic procedure were on a par in terms of sexual function with men who had either of the two types of radiation treatment.      “Someone who undergoes robotic prostatectomy will likely experience a better sexual function return than open prostatectomy,” Chien told Reuters Health.    Urinary incontinence was also worst after surgical prostate removal compared to active surveillance. Of all the treatments, only the hormonal therapy was not associated with worse incontinence compared to active surveillance.   Differences among the other quality of life measures were not as extreme, and the findings are similar to those of past research, the authors note.    Intuit Surgical, maker of robotic surgery equipment, funded the study.   The researchers can’t tell whether the differences between treatments in function levels afterward are significant enough to be noticeable to patients, Chien said.   But there are a number of cancer registries around the United States collecting similar data, he added. “Our study shows us a window into what those registries will show.”   "
2qsDoNQ,2017-05-05,Runners battling infections are less likely to finish a race," (Reuters Health) - Light, localized illnesses like a runny nose may not affect distance runners’ performance, but racing within days of an acute, systemic infection raises the odds of never finishing, researchers say.                    Competitors race in the women's 800 metres during the Sydney Track Classic February 18, 2012. REUTERS/Tim Wimborne      Typically, less than half of runners who have been recently diagnosed with acute systemic infections, such as respiratory infections or gastritis, follow their doctors’ advice not to run in a race, the study team writes in British Journal of Sports Medicine.    “We previously showed that about 10 percent of runners have symptoms of acute illness in the few days before a race,” study coauthor Dr. Martin Schwellnus said by email.   “Acute illness can affect a number of physiological systems during exercise, and more importantly, can result in medical complications during exercise,” said Schwellnus, who directs the Sport, Exercise Medicine and Lifestyle Institute of the University of Pretoria in South Africa.   Schwellnus and his colleagues decided to study runners who reported pre-race illness to determine the effects of various symptoms on racing outcome.   They evaluated runners who thought they might be sick in the three days before the 2013 and 2014 Old Mutual Two Oceans Marathons in Cape Town. Of the more than 53,000 runners who participated in the two events, about 240 asked for the evaluations.   The evaluations included taking medical histories and referring runners to medical doctors if they reported symptoms such as fever, muscle and body aches, fatigue, coughs, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, shortness of breath or chest pain.   A total of 172 runners reported signs and symptoms of acute infective illness  with 101 of the runners having localized symptoms such as a runny nose or sinus pain, and 71 runners having symptoms of respiratory tract or other systemic infections. About 140 of the runners were given advice on how to handle their illnesses and doctors advised 23 acutely ill runners not to start the race.    The study team found that runners with a systemic illness who started the race despite being told they shouldn’t run had an 8 percent chance of not finishing the race, compared with less than 2 percent among healthy runners.    About 11 percent of runners who were diagnosed with acute illness during the 24 hours just before the race did not finish.   Runners with systemic symptoms such as fever, generalized muscle pain and joint pain, chest pain, elevated resting heart rate, dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea should not run, said Schwellnus.   “Runners with no systemic symptoms and only ‘localized’ symptoms such as blocked nose or runny nose can start the race, but be prepared to stop if their symptoms get worse or they develop new symptoms,” he said.   Schwellnus noted that it is especially important to stop if runners feel chest pain, dizziness, excessive shortness of breath, excessive fatigue or palpitations.   The study team didn’t examine how well the runners performed in the races, but it’s likely they didn’t do as well as they would if they were healthy.   “In a previous study in triathletes, we have shown that sick participants are slower than their predicted finishing times. In this study we did not have their predicted finishing times to compare,” Schwellnus said.  "
2qAlXuV,2017-05-05,Can herbal remedies help kids with gastrointestinal issues?," (Reuters Health) - Many parents of children with debilitating gastrointestinal disorders may be frustrated by the lack of good treatment options and tempted to try herbal remedies at home, but a new study suggests they should proceed with caution.    Researchers examined data from 14 previously published studies with a total of 1,927 children suffering from problems like diarrhea, dehydration, colic, constipation, abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome. They didn’t have enough data to combine results from multiple small studies to offer definitive proof that herbal remedies might work for any of these health problems.    But some of the small studies did suggest certain herbal medicines might help ease diarrhea, abdominal pain and colic. And the studies didn’t find serious side effects associated with herbal remedies.    “The lack of conclusive research is unfortunately a general problem in pediatrics, but a special problem in herbal medicine is that for many herbal remedies no licensed and standardized products are available,” said lead study author Dr. Dennis Anheyer of the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany.    In other words, even if evidence shows an herb may be safe and effective for a specific health problem, that doesn’t necessarily mean that every single version of that herb available for sale would work as well or be free of side effects.    When researchers looked at four studies with a total of 424 participants, they found some evidence suggesting that a variety of herbal remedies might help diarrhea: a plant in the rose family called potentilla erecta, carob bean juice, and an herbal compound preparation with chamomile.    One study with 120 participants also suggests that peppermint oil might help curb the duration, frequency and severity chronic abdominal pain that doesn’t have a clear medical explanation.    And, fennel might help ease colic symptoms in babies according to a review of five small studies of herbal remedies for infant colic.    While it’s possible herbal remedies might be used in addition to traditional medications or to help reduce reliance on drug therapy, parents should still see a doctor before trying out herbal therapies on their own, Anheyer said by email.    Another reason for caution is that even the studies in the current analysis that found herbal remedies effective don’t show how large the effects are, noted Dr. Peter Lucassen, a researcher at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands who wasn’t involved in the study.    These small studies might get results that find herbs are statistically better than no treatment or alternative therapies, but the difference still might not be big enough to have a meaningful clinical impact on patients’ symptoms, Lucassen said by email.    “I would not advocate any of the herbal medicine because the article does not provide any data about how large the effects are,” Lucassen said.    Often, herbal remedies combine a variety of ingredients and use differing amounts of the main ingredients, which may alter how well they work and how safe they are for kids, Lucassen added. They might also contain chemicals not found in prescription medications that have dangerous side effects or a risk of overdose.    And there’s another reason parents shouldn’t try herbal remedies without seeing a doctor.   “Delayed diagnosis might be the result of herbal medications because parents seek help too late because they try the herbs first,” Lucassen said.

2qx43Ji,2017-05-04,Prescribing video games for kids with sensory and attention problems," (Reuters Health) - The right kind of video game might one day help improve attention skills in some kids with sensory disorders that make it hard to process what they see and hear, a small experiment suggests.                     FILE PHOTO - Visitors play use keyboards as they play during the Gamescom 2012 fair in Cologne August 16, 2012. REUTERS/Ina Fassbender      For the study, researchers focused on 38 children with what’s known as sensory processing dysfunction, a condition that can make them unusually sensitive to things like the sound of a toilet flushing or the feel of a tag inside a shirt. The experiment also included a control group of 25 typically developing kids.    After four weeks of playing games designed to help kids with sensory problems, researchers found a significant improvement in attention skills among a subset of 20 kids with sensory issues who also had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).   “Children with sensory processing dysfunction have differences in the way their brains are wired,” said senior study author Dr. Elysa Marco of the University of California San Francisco.   “We think that there are differences in not only the wiring for sensory modulation but also for what we call cognitive control which includes the ability to sustain attention even in the face of distraction,” Marco said by email.    The University of California San Francisco and Akili Interactive Labs are developing the game kids played on a digital platform called Project: EVO. Researchers are investigating EVO as a therapy for children with cognitive impairments, including sensory processing dysfunction and ADHD.    An estimated one in 20 kids have sensory processing problems. Depending on their issues, they might be treated with occupational therapy to help them become more comfortable with input that upsets them, like loud noise or bright light, or they might be trained to become more sensitive to input they ignore, like pain, that makes them engage in reckless behavior.    The game is designed to help strengthen how the brain processes and prioritizes thoughts and external stimuli. Players help a character in the game navigate through winding paths, avoiding walls and obstacles. As they improve, the game becomes more difficult.    Kids in the study ranged in age from 8 to 11 years old. Researchers asked them to play EVO for 25 minutes, five days a week for four weeks.    At the start of the study, 54 percent of the children with sensory processing problems also had ADHD, based on symptoms reported by their parents, researchers report in PLoS ONE.    After playing the game for a month, parents of seven of the kids with both sensory issues and ADHD reported enough improvement in their children for kids to no longer meet the clinical definition for ADHD, the study found.    Beyond its small size and the experimental nature of the therapeutic game being tested, other limitations of the study include the lack of tests comparing EVO to a placebo game that wasn’t designed to achieve specific medical outcomes, the authors note.    “One wouldn’t hypothesize that any random game would help,” said Aaron Seitz, director of the University of California Riverside Brain Game Center for Mental Fitness and Wellbeing.    “Key to the success of this study is that the Evo game is designed to train players to selectively attend to target stimuli and ignore distracting stimuli,” Seitz, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    If it reaches the market, it might make sense to consider EVO among the behavioral interventions to give children in addition to medication, Seitz added.    “The ideal is for drugs to be temporary measures that together with therapy can help children learn to cope with their conditions and then as they improve they can be weaned off the drugs,” Seitz said. “While there is some hope that this type of video game . . . can replace drugs, the more realistic perspective is that it is an additional tool that doctors and parents can use to improve outcomes.”  "
2qsBdtT,2017-05-04,Having adult heart risk factors in childhood tied to mental decline later," Teens and even children with heart risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking may face midlife declines in memory and learning that are akin to an extra six years of aging, according to a Finnish study.   Heart risk factors are well known to affect cognitive skills in old age, but these results show that risk factors starting in childhood may affect thinking decades later, the study team writes in Journal of the American College of Cardiology.   “This study underlines the beneficial role of healthy lifestyle for brain and cardiovascular health,” said lead author Suvi Rovio, a senior researcher at the Research Center of Applied and Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine in the University of Turku.   “High blood pressure, elevated serum cholesterol levels and smoking are risk factors that are modifiable e.g. through healthy lifestyle choices,” Rovio told Reuters Health by email.   To examine the link between childhood risk factors and mental function in middle age, the study team used data from the Young Finns Study, which followed over 3,500 children starting in 1980 and continuing through 2011.   The participants were between 3 and 18 years old when they joined the study and they had regular assessments of blood pressure, cholesterol, body mass index (BMI, a measure of weight relative to height) and other aspects of health including smoking status up to age 24.   In 2011, more than 2,000 participants between the ages of 34 and 49 underwent cognitive testing, including assessments of visual memory, memory of past events and visual learning ability.   Researchers found that people with high blood pressure and high cholesterol in their youth were likely to have worse visual memory, memory of life events and visual learning when they reached middle age.    Smoking during adolescence and young adulthood was also linked to worse memory and learning in midlife.    Heart risk factors carried the same risk of cognitive problems later in life regardless of whether a participant had them during childhood, adolescence or young adulthood.   Having two or three heart risk factors at a young age also carried a greater risk of cognitive decline in middle age than having only one.   Researchers calculated the difference in midlife cognitive performance between people who had no heart risk factors in youth and those who had all the risk factors during two phases of youth, such as adolescence and young adulthood. It was equivalent to an additional six years of aging.   “Cognitive impairment is a major cause of morbidity and impaired quality of life in older age,” said Norrina Allen, coauthor of an editorial accompanying the study.   “Findings ways to prevent declines in cognitive function are critical to improving the health of our populations as they age,” said Allen, a public health researcher at Northwestern University in Chicago who was not involved in the study.     “A focus on good health early in life can result in better cognitive function in older age,” Allen said. “We need to focus on maintaining our health starting in very early childhood and throughout adulthood.”   “Adopting healthy lifestyle choices throughout the life-course is an effective way to affect the cardiovascular risk factors and increase the possibilities to cognitively vital adulthood and old age,” Rovio said.

2ozb4tj,2017-05-04,Mindfulness meditation may work differently for men and women," (Reuters Health) - In a college course that included meditation training, women were more likely than men to report that the practice improved their mood, a small study found.   Meditation is an increasingly popular form of mental training on college campuses and off. Research suggests it may reduce blood pressure, gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, depression and insomnia, according to the National Institutes of Health ( bit.ly/1BQ4I9l ).    Practitioners direct and redirect their attention to the present moment, often by focusing on their breath.   At the end of a mindfulness meditation course at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, female students, on average, rated their so-called negative affect significantly lower than at the beginning, indicating better mood. But among male students, the only difference was a very slight increase in their negative affect, possibly indicating a worsened mood, researchers reported in Frontiers in Psychology.    Senior author Willoughby Britton cautioned against concluding that men fail to reap rewards from meditation, though. Instead, the Brown professor of psychiatry and human behavior said the gender differences could reflect variations in the ways men and women tend to regulate their emotions.   “There has just been too much data - both anecdotal and empirical - suggesting that many men benefit from mindfulness,” she said in an email.    Dr. Madhav Goyal, who practices meditation and studies it as a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, pointed to a group dedicated to practicing meditation.   “Most of the monks who meditate are men,” he said in a phone interview.   Previous research validates the benefits of meditation for men and women, Britton and Goyal both said.   Britton and her colleagues analyzed self-reported surveys from 77 students, 41 men and 36 women who completed 12 weeks of seminars and meditation labs between 2008 and 2011. The labs met three times a week and included about 30 minutes of Buddhist or Daoist meditation practices.   At the end of the course, women self-reported greater gains in their ability to observe their feelings and describe them as well as their ability not to judge or react, the study found.    Men also showed improvements in self-compassion as well as in not judging and not reacting. But they reported an average 3.7 percent increase in their negative affect score, compared to women who showed an average 11.6 percent drop in negative affect.   Though the men’s average negative affect score went up slightly, some of the men probably improved their mood, while the training probably did not lift the spirits of all the women, Britton said.   “We may need to pay more attention to issues of diversity and individual differences that could impact how different people respond to mindfulness interventions,” she said. “The differences we found may not be about gender per se but about different emotion-regulation strategies or goals.”   When faced with challenging feelings, women tend to ruminate, and men tend to find ways to be distracted, Britton said.    “While facing one’s difficulties and feeling one’s emotions may seem to be universally beneficial, it does not take into account that there may be different cultural expectations for men and women around emotionality,” she said.   Men and women may process meditation skills differently, said Goyal, who was not involved in the study. That said, the point of meditation is not to reduce negative affect, though people do use the practice to that end.   The point of meditation is “to learn to be in the present moment and through this practice over time, one gains greater understanding of themselves,” Goyal said.      Sydney Tan, a Brown senior who took the class as a sophomore and served as a discussion leader this year, has seen many men who benefited from the class and some women who struggled with it.   “I actually had more women talk to me about the difficulties of sitting for a long time and being still,” she said in a phone interview.   “It’s more complex than just the duality of this is the women’s experience, and this is the men’s experience,” she said. “It’s more nuanced.”  "
2pG6feK,2017-05-03,Is a placebo better than nothing to treat insomnia?," (Reuters Health) - People with insomnia who take placebos, or “dummy pills,” may feel more rested than patients who get no treatment at all, a review of sleep research finds.    Previous clinical trials testing sleep drugs like temazepam (Restoril) against placebo pills have found insomnia symptoms can improve even when patients don’t get the real treatment, said senior study author Dr. Ben Colagiuri of the University of Sydney in Australia. One problem with using placebos in these trials, however, is that sometimes simply taking part in a study can influence how people perceive their symptoms, he said.    To solve this issue, Colagiuri and colleagues examined data from 13 previously published studies that assigned some insomnia patients to receive a placebo they were led to believe was an active treatment or to a control group that got no treatment.    Compared to participants who didn’t receive any treatment, those who got placebos they believed were real treatments reported more improvements in their ability to fall asleep, total amount of rest and sleep quality, the analysis found.    “The comparison with no treatment means that we can be sure that the improvement we observed was due to a genuine placebo effect, rather than being an artifact of simply taking part in a trial,” Colagiuri said by email. “The study provides new evidence that genuine placebo effects exist for insomnia treatments.”   Combined, the studies used in the analysis had a total of 566 participants who either reported that they had insomnia or had the condition diagnosed by a clinician.   It’s unclear exactly why the placebo might help some people feel better rested, but it’s possible just the act of taking a pill eased some anxiety that made it harder for people to fall asleep, Colagiuri said.  Some recent research in other conditions like migraines and chronic pain suggests the placebos may help even when people know they’re taking dummy pills, he added.   However, when researchers examined data on 103 participants who had objective tests like sleep-phase monitoring to measure how quickly patients fell asleep with a placebo or without treatment, they didn’t find any significant difference between these groups.    Beyond the small number of total participants, another limitation of the current study is that researchers didn’t have objective measurements of sleep quality or duration to compare placebos against no treatment, the authors note in Sleep Medicine.   Still, the results make sense because insomnia is ultimately a disorder of perception, said Patrick Finan, a psychiatry and behavior researcher at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.    For example, a person who reports typically getting only four hours of sleep a night, for example, might not meet the criteria for insomnia if they don’t feel like the lack of rest impairs their mood, cognition or behavior, Finan, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    By contrast, a person who says they normally get seven hours a night might still have insomnia if they feel like they the amount or quality of sleep they get is inadequate and they also report daytime impairments in work or home life that they attribute to a lack of sleep, Finan added.    “The upshot is insomnia is shaped by expectation and perception, so it is not surprising that placebos, which implicitly alter expectation, are effective in improving perceptions of sleep,” Finan said. “It is notable that the effects of placebos did not extend to objective measures of sleep.”  "
2p7zbxT,2017-05-03,More evidence ties childhood obesity to type 2 diabetes in kids," (Reuters Health) - Rates of type 2 diabetes among children in the UK have been rising, and tracking along with increased obesity and severe obesity, researchers say.   Based on data for hundreds of thousands of UK children and teens, the study found that obese kids were four times as likely as normal weight children to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, which has already been linked to obesity in adults.   “Obesity is a major global health issue. More than half of adults and one out of three children leaving primary school are now overweight or obese,” said lead study author Ali Abbasi of King’s College London.    More than 12 million children and teens in the United States are considered obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 3,600 cases of type 2 diabetes are diagnosed in children and teens each year in the U.S.    “The rapidity of the increase in type 2 diabetes is a real concern, which may have an important impact on the health of future generations,” Abbasi told Reuters Health by email.   Abbasi and colleagues looked at records from 375 doctors’ offices across the UK for the years 1994 through 2013. They analyzed data from 369,362 patients between ages 2 and 15, tracking new cases of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and comparing them to children’s body mass index (BMI), a measure of weight relative to height, over time.   There were 654 type 2 diabetes cases and 1,318 type 1 diabetes cases diagnosed during the study period.   The incidence of type 2 diabetes among the children rose from 6.4 cases per 100,000 people per year in 1994 - 1998 to 33.2 cases per 100,000 per year in 2009 - 2013, the study team reports in Journal of the Endocrine Society.   The increase took place primarily among overweight and obese children, and the greatest risk was seen among the obese kids.   During the same period, the increase in proportion of kids who were obese stabilized, the researchers note, but BMIs among obese children rose, meaning obesity became more severe.   Type 1 diabetes incidence also rose, though less dramatically, from 38.2 cases per 100,000 per year to 52.1 per 100,000 per year over the study period but there was no link to overweight or obesity.     “Unfortunately, little surprises me about the findings of this study, since we have been reporting an increasing risk of type 2 diabetes in children in the Pima Indians since the 1970s,” said Robert Nelson of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases office in Phoenix, who wasn’t involved with the study.    “The next steps are to carefully characterize the magnitude of obesity and its impact on diabetes incidence,” he told Reuters Health by email. “We are finding in American Indians that children who are severely obese have a far higher incidence than those who are obese or overweight.”   Nelson and colleagues are studying ways to manage pregnancy weight gain and prevent gestational diabetes in mothers, which increases the risk of the child developing diabetes early in life.   “Understanding the relationship between obesity and diabetes in kids is important because diabetes can actually develop in children while they’re still children,” said Asheley Skinner of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, who wasn’t involved with the study.    “One important aspect to note is that about half of kids who develop type 2 diabetes aren’t obese,” she told Reuters Health. “Those who are obese have four times the risk, but that only represents part of equation. Obesity isn’t the only important risk factor here.”   “We spend a lot of time and effort on trying to reduce obesity, and it’s often not successful,” Skinner said. “We should use diet and activity in all kids to reduce the risk for diabetes, as well as other diseases later in life.”  "
2qt8WmQ,2017-05-03,"Gluten-free diets don&#039;t help heart health, might harm it"," (Reuters Health) - People who don’t have conditions like celiac disease tend to adopt gluten-free diets because of perceived overall health benefits, but a new study says cutting the protein from diets certainly won’t benefit heart health.   In one analysis, researchers found that gluten-free diets were tied to greater heart risk among people without celiac disease, gluten sensitivity or wheat allergies.   “I think it’s important to realize that just because there is a notion that gluten-free is healthy doesn’t make it so,” said lead author Dr. Benjamin Lebwohl, of the Celiac Disease Center at Columbia University Medical Center in New York.   He and his colleagues write in the journal BMJ that about 1 percent of people in the United States have celiac disease, which is an autoimmune response that damages the lining of the small intestine when the body encounters the protein gluten that is found in wheat, rye and barley.   People with celiac disease are at an increased risk of heart disease but, the researchers point out, that risk is reduced by their switching to a gluten-free diet.   Despite no evidence that people without celiac disease and similar conditions benefit from cutting out gluten, some people believe that eating the protein may increase the risk of poor health outcomes, including obesity and heart disease.   Most people who follow gluten-free diets have celiac disease, the study team notes. Still, one national survey in 2013 found nearly a third of people in the United States said they were trying to minimize or avoid gluten.   For the new study, the researchers used data collected from a group of 121,700 female nurses followed since 1976 and a group of 51,529 male healthcare workers followed since 1986.   In addition to collected data on their health, the participants filled out food questionnaires every four years between 1986 and 2010.   People were separated into five groups based on the amount of gluten in their diets. People who ate the least gluten consumed about 3 grams of the protein each day, compared with people in the who ate the highest amount, between about 8 and 10 grams each day.   Overall, there were 352 coronary heart disease events like heart attacks per 100,000 people per year among those who ate the least gluten. That compared to 277 events per 100,000 people per year among those who ate the most gluten.   After adjusting for known risk factors, the researchers write that there was no statistically meaningful difference between the two groups.   “We think this is very important, because this boom in gluten-free diets and all these claims that it’s beneficial to an individual’s health to be on a gluten-free diet are not based on science,” said Dr. Peter Green, a co-author of the study and director of Columbia’s Celiac Disease Center.   After adjusting the data to account for the amount and type of grains people consumed, the researchers did find a slightly decreased risk of heart disease events among people who ate the most gluten compared to those who ate the least.   “People who had a low-gluten diets tended to have a diet that was low in whole grains,” said senior author Andrew Chan, of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. “That does have health implications.”   Specifically, the researchers write, the risk of heart attacks and other events tend to decrease as people eat more whole grains.   “If people are restricting their diet, there is always the possibility that their diets become deficient in things that we know are beneficial,” Chan told Reuters Health.   Green also said gluten-free diets may lack fiber and B vitamins and may increase the risk of heavy metal toxicity.   “If someone is on a gluten-free diet, they should be under the guidance of a registered dietician,” he said.

2qgNUHP,2017-05-03,"Bystander CPR, defibrillation cuts long-term odds of brain damage, death"," (Reuters Health) - When a bystander gives CPR or applies an automatic defibrillator to someone who has collapsed from cardiac arrest, the benefits persist for at least a year.    A Danish study has concluded that the two techniques lower the long-term risk of death from any cause, brain damage or nursing home admission by one third in people who are still alive 30 days after their cardiac arrest.   Most previous studies have looked at whether people who get CPR or defibrillation manage to survive or escape serious injury by the 30-day mark.   “This science provides the linkage to show that resuscitation is not just important in the immediate cardiac arrest phase, but it’s an important factor into whether they go back to their lives intact,” said Dr. Michael Kurz, associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of Alabama-Birmingham Medicine, who was not involved in the study.   “We were surprised to see that, once you select 30-day survivors, so many were still alive at one year and the majority of these survivors seemed to have a fairly good outcome,” study coauthor Dr. Kristian Kragholm told Reuters Health in a telephone interview. “If bystanders intervened by starting chest compression, survivors were less likely to experience brain damage or be admitted to a nursing home. And with an AED (automated external defibrillator), the benefit was even greater.”   For the public, it’s further evidence “of what you can do when you witness a cardiac arrest,” and why policy makers should be working harder to both require resuscitation training for the general public and make more defibrillators available in public places, said Kragholm, of Aalborg University Hospital in Denmark.   The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, used national registries to identify 34,459 people who had received some type of bystander resuscitation when they had cardiac arrest outside of a hospital. Only 8.3 percent survived for a month.   But with bystander CPR, the odds of subsequent death from any cause at one year among the 30-day survivors were 30 percent lower, the likelihood of brain damage or nursing home admission was 38 percent lower and the rate of all three outcomes combined was 33 percent lower.   With bystander defibrillation, the death rate was 78 percent lower, the composite of brain damage or nursing home admission was 55 percent lower and the odds for the combination of all three were also 55 percent lower. But the number of cases where a defibrillator was used was relatively small, even though the automated devices are becoming more common.   Over all, the risk of brain damage or a nursing home admission was just 3.7 percent if the cardiac arrest was witnessed by emergency medical service personnel. If bystanders used defibrillation, the rate was 8.4 percent. If bystanders used CPR alone it was 12.1 percent. The danger was highest - 18.6 percent - when no bystander resuscitation was done.   “This underpins the importance of the public to identify and respond to that emergency,” Kurz said. “Denmark has a very impressive bystander CPR rate. That’s one of the reasons the numbers in this article are so good.”   During the study, which ran from 2001 through 2012, the rate of bystander CPR went from 67 percent of the cases to 81 percent, and the rate of bystander defibrillation jumped from 2 percent to nearly 17 percent.   “Such increases are probably related to the multiple nationwide initiatives that have been taken in Denmark, including widespread mandatory and voluntary CPR training; widespread dissemination of automated external defibrillators; the introduction of health care professionals at emergency dispatch centers, facilitating dispatcher-assisted CPR; and the formation and linkage of an automated external defibrillator registry to the dispatch centers, enabling health care professionals to guide bystanders to the nearest automated external defibrillators,” Kurz said.    Bystanders themselves can also locate the nearest automated external defibrillator with the use of a smartphone application.   CPR education became mandatory in schools in 2005 and for people acquiring a driver’s license in 2006, according to Kragholm.   Kurz said that in the United States, defibrillators should be required in local building codes the way communities require fire alarms, smoke detectors and fire extinguishers.  "
2qcNAdr,2017-05-03,Home blood pressure monitors may not be accurate enough," (Reuters Health) – Even as doctors are increasingly relying on home blood pressure monitoring to manage patients with hypertension, many of the devices are too inaccurate to be useful, according to a small study.    About 70 percent of the time, home monitors weren’t accurate within 5 mmHg, which is considered clinically important, researchers say. And 30 percent of the time the devices were 10 mmHg off the mark.   Hypertension, or high blood pressure, “is the number one cause of death and disability in the world,” said lead study author Jennifer Ringrose of the University of Alberta in Canada.    “Guidelines are recommending that clinicians rely more on automatic and home blood pressure readings to diagnose and monitor high blood pressure,” she told Reuters Health by email. “We need to make sure these home blood pressure readings are accurate.”   Ringrose and colleagues gauged the accuracy of home blood pressure monitors used by 85 patients and tested for differences between upper-arm versus wrist devices, brand names, hard versus soft cuffs and devices that were validated according to industry technical standards and those that were not.    Two observers tested each patient simultaneously, taking a total of nine blood pressure measurements and alternating between the device used at home and a standardized cuff used in a doctor’s office.    Blood pressure is measured with two numbers: systolic pressure when the heart pumps blood and diastolic pressure when the heart rests between beats. Blood pressure below 120 mmHg systolic/80 mmHg diastolic is considered healthy. Pressure above 140/90 mmHg is considered high.   The researchers found that home monitors were more often wrong for systolic pressure. For 54 percent of patients, that measurement differed by 5 mmHg from the professional device. For 20 percent, it was wrong by 10 mmHg, and for 7 percent it was off by 15 mmHg or more. With diastolic pressure, the same was true of 31 percent, 12 percent and 1 percent of patients.   Arm size and gender were the main predictors of a systolic blood pressure difference, with men typically having a larger discrepancy, the researchers found. Also, older age, larger arm circumference, hard cuff design, and older device models were linked with diastolic blood pressure discrepancy.    Age and stiffness of blood vessels, for example, can make a significant difference if blood pressure monitors aren’t calibrated for the patient using it, the study authors write in the American Journal of Hypertension.   “There can be substantial error, even in devices that have been tested in a validation study,” said senior study author Raj Padwal of the Mazankowski Heart Institute in Alberta.    “A major issue is that it is hard to study why inaccuracies occur because the algorithm that these devices use to determine blood pressure is proprietary and kept secret by each company,” Padwal said by email.   The research team suggests creating a third-party way for both doctors and patients to check home devices, if needed.   “First, patients should purchase a validated monitor and use the proper sized cuff,” Padwal said. “Second, we - device makers and academic researchers - have to come up with more accurate devices.”   They also suggest making diagnostic and treatment decisions based on the average of multiple measurements. Canadian guidelines, for example, recommend 28 measurements during one week for home devices, and changes in medication should be based on more than a few measurements.    “The market for this equipment is rising dramatically into the billions in the next couple of years as patients age, and more doctors are using them to diagnose and manage hypertension,” said Marcel Ruzicka of the University of Ottawa who co-wrote a commentary accompanying the study.   “As health care providers, we’re becoming more dependent on the numbers that patients are bringing to us, and in a busy office where you can’t get a true resting blood pressure, those may be the only numbers you have,” he told Reuters Health.   Both patients and doctors should discuss home blood pressure monitor accuracy during appointments, Ruzicka said, including how devices should be checked and how often.    “It’s important to be aware that this inaccuracy is out there,” Ruzicka said. “Next, we should ensure that accuracy checks are widely available and not cost prohibitive for device owners.”  "
2p52Gh1,2017-05-02,African American women not immune to alcohol-breast cancer link," (Reuters Health) - Having more than one alcoholic drink a day has long been linked to increased breast cancer risk in studies involving mostly white women, but new U.S. research finds similar risk increases among black women.   Compared to light drinkers who had less than four alcoholic beverages a week, African American women who consumed at least two drinks a day were 33 percent more likely to develop invasive breast cancer, the study found. With one drink a day, black women still had an elevated risk for all types of breast malignancies.   “Many breast cancer risk factors like family history cannot be changed, however, alcohol drinking can be moderated if a woman wants to decrease her risk,” said senior study author Melissa Troester, a researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.    “Most studies show that risk is only significantly increased if women drink more than one drink per day,” Troester added by email.    Alcohol is a well known risk factor for breast cancer, but much of the previous research establishing this connection has been done in white women, Troester and her colleagues note in the journal Cancer, Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.    It’s possible alcohol may interfere with hormone levels in a way that encourages tumor growth, and it also might cause genetic damage that makes cancer more likely, Troester said. The type of drink most responsible for cancer seems to be whatever type of alcohol women drink the most.   “Studies of alcohol and breast cancer have been conducted in many countries across the globe, and in each country, the beverage that is most widely consumed is associated with increased risk,” Troester said. “This has led researchers to conclude that it is the alcohol content rather than the specific drink that is causing the increased risk.”   For the current study, researchers examined data on drinking habits for 22,338 African American women, including 5,018 who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer.    Overall, 45 percent of the women said they never drank and another 21 percent said they used to consume alcohol but currently did not.    Compared to light drinkers, women who said they never drank were 12 percent more likely to develop invasive tumors. The increased risk was smaller, around 4 percent, for former drinkers and for women who currently had four to six drinks a week.    For those who had 7 to 13 drinks a week, the risk increase was 7 percent compared to light drinkers.   Other risk factors for breast cancer, such as smoking, oral contraceptive use and whether women had gone through menopause didn’t appear to alter the connection between drinking and breast malignancies, the study also found.    The study isn’t a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how alcohol causes breast cancer. Researchers also lacked data on diet and exercise, which can influence the risk of breast malignancies, and they didn’t know why some women chose to abstain from drinking.    “Women who never drink may be different than light drinkers in other risk factors, e.g. their diet,” said Dr. Mary Daly of Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia.    “Light drinkers may be more likely to adhere to a Mediterranean diet which includes moderate alcohol intake and which has been associated with better overall health and with lower breast cancer risk,” Daly, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.    Even so, the current study establishes that black women have an increased risk of breast cancer with alcohol use, a connection previously seen in research of white women, said Dr. Sharon Giordano of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.    “The take-home message is that African-American women are also at increased risk of breast cancer due to alcohol use and should be encouraged to limit alcohol use,” Giordano, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.
